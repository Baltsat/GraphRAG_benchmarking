The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his
nephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to
Paine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe
offered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed
a true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was
taking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine's about 5 o'clock, sat about an
hour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me
to-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but
when I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We
were up by five o'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in
commemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against
the sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:
stores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the
honour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished
peaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked
with him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was
walking about Carver's shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old
philosopher, in bed at 4 o'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well
as when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine's papier-mache snuff-box, which
     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,
     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is
     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July
5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print
I left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family
who came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or
noticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old
friend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There
is no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of
culture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of
Paine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they
travelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine
months later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine
from Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent
disagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,
lying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his
actions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But
next day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable
writes:

"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national
defence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and
ships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures
called prophecies, etc.He says
that this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will
not touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine's just then
experimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a
scandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that
thirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had
"the Bible bound up with the 'Age of Reason,' and that they spoke in
very disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his
farm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of
his slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of
intemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to
time for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister
to Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw
persons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there
without fault.Staple, brother of the
influential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine's religious views
by some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at
New Rochelle.Burger, Pelton's clerk, used to drive Paine about
     daily.Vale says:

     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and
     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his
     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and
     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine
     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless
     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean
     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with
     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring
     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing
     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine's dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between
Paine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates
the latter's bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly
and dishonestly treated in Carver's house, and had taken him out of his
Will.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly
never wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him
hardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*

     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of
     Cheetham's book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was
     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned
     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars
     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--
     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any
     person reading Cheetham's life of Paine that [sic] his pen
     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham's
     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a
     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice
     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the
     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then
     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing
     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a
     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the
     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was
     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this
     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.
     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written
for Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver's
letter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the
correspondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years
hanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,
he could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham
had compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham
had obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters
written in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means
to publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical
errours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a
candid and impartial public will not view them 'with a critick's eye.'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine's faulty grammar, which
Carver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own
letter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he
written it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan's.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver
     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for
wich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to
Paine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver's antipathy
to whom arose from his hopes of Paine's property.In reply to Paine's
information, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I
likewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your
mind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to
appear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing
afterwards."Carver's letter
is dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine's life,
for the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame
Bonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine's death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning
Paine's domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts
personally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"
says Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he
wrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this
plain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to
blackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never
made any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made
an effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you
or myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each
other--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place
between us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have
caused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not
more effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,
and Carver, who had flattered Paine's "great mind," in the letter
just quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for
Cheetham's projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to
publish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which
he meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter
had he not written it.All of Cheetham's libels on Paine's life in New
York are amplifications of Carver's insinuations.In describing Cheetham
as "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this
blackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally
the charges relating to Paine's last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux
mansion.In 1891 I
visited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,
finding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated
in the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used
to sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of
his."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a
perfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,
never intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my
grandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she
heard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those
who uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members
of the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau's religious opinions
are I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman
could for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It
certainly was not until some years after his return to America that any
slovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often
remarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was
neglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once
associated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who
need it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always
     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and
     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,
     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I
     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very
     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side
     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French
     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge
     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had
aversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I
have sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the
following conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the
custom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,
which causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the
oft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was
prominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just
after he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and
at public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no
instance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise
Office to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or
intemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America
(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall's
daily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning
everything, but in no case is a word said of Paine's drinking.Paine's enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every
charge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine
told Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private
affliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified
on a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest
friends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected
to follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and
drank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,
where Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to
Caleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less
than any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,
questioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton's store at New Rochelle, and
found that Paine's liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per
week.He also questioned Jarvis, the
artist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five
months, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and
himself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink
much."In July, 1809, just after Paine's death, Cheetham wrote
Barlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his
character," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a
merchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order
of Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of
Washington; he could know nothing of Cheetham's treachery, and fell into
his trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for
granted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about
Paine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,
though strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the
heaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his
former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had
received his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking
down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
their society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he
was, well knew Paine's nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not
from appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a
stock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine
found no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps
discover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness
that threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the
terrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left
Carver's to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the
house of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained
ten months.Hitt reports that Paine's weekly supply then--his
seventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd's "Joel Barlow," p.was one
     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never
     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver's he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor's recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John
Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and
fire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,
and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,
and was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows
was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was
intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to
this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of
wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both
in the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and
irreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant
personal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine's life, that
he never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that
all accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under
all circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,
they said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age
and Paine, like Jefferson, could 'bear but little spirit,' so that he
was constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I
visited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed
with the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was
a drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter
to Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when
he wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;
that Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it
without authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole
course of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him
on religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,
philosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from
their own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their
integrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be
impossible to give."During Paine's life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality
connected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the
following: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in
whose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three
sons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"
Madame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had
betrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to
blackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed
he had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not
actionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville
in court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation
between the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was
preposterous.Cheetham's lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things
that his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine
smile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the
slander.She never saw but
decency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when
Paine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver's
lies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole
story (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine's estate for tuition
of the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,
"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not
have come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for
her children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that
"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,
and Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine's child."But, apart from the
intrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),
Underbill's character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,
Judge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence
but Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead
lips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham's case by saying that
Paine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;
the charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted
from Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to
Paine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to
visit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham's
case was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that
"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or
illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were
alone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects
of Paine's care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that
Paine's Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this
mysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and
disappointed speculators."Sampson's invective was terrific; Cheetham
rose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson
took a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:

"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross
abuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself
a monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a
party, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit
still to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court
against a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does
she deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of
coming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has
lavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten
     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson's speech says that the jury "although
composed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few
minutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:

"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive
his sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
imposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,
with a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,
lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should
receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong
to the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office
by men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the
councils of state."*

     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret
     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,
     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and
     for other information, to the industrious collector of
     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.

Madame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her
character,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose
children she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an
illustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham's defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a
French woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they
could little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years
had thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals
as the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into
variants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that
Paine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu
Palmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,
etc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose
name Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a
romantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the
execution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young
children in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,
supported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his
property to them when he died.The widow and children lived in
apartments up town by themselves.I believe
his conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared
to be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*

     * "Forty Years' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was
the widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first
brought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth
of the time (1834), and an indication that Paine's generosity to
the Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth
quoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years
afterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it
was whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though
he was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it
has gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of
McClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]
followed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas
Bonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where
he and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by
Paine's self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents
concerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have
been brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except
out of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory
of sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for
the same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of
a home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our
revolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law
of his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,
he could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be
persecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION

The blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle
was heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously
gained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first
advocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were
low, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were
insulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or
two letters to Congress, of which Paine's enemies did not fail to make
the most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for
     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by
some, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,
and did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his
daughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The
only procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and
artfulness.Paine's physician was the most distinguished in New York,
Dr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one
Dr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham's spy.Manly afterwards
contributed to Cheetham's book a lying letter, in which he claimed
to have been Paine's physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame
Bonneville's narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of
his friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,
never saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but
he converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*

     * Another claimant to have been Paine's physician has been
     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham
     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that
     he had been Paine's physician, and witnessed his
     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it
     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine
     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith
     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had
     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever
     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who
     attests his sobriety.Smith is
     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection
     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor
     any item of Wickham's report is mentioned.He said Paine
     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the
ministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The
three alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,
terrible death.Before Paine's arrival in America, the excitement on
his approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an
anticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly
devised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his
arrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,
The Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as
fencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars
for writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the
expedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more
concerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try
something more worthy of a man."*

     * Dr.Francis' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists
were describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind
in Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"
Thomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of
thunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any
sectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine
from his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark
affixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared
to return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was
searched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment
when New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,
Christopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a
few feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author
sat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the
prophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their
antagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine
was spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore
years and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him
represented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred
years ago.Renan thinks
he will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated
Christian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a
Darwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that
he might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel's legend."In 1875, when
he was ill in St Luke's Hospital, New York, he desired me to question
the physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his
fearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he
has died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine's case;
that was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by
the fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton's
world-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the
Presbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and
orthodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:

"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the
Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of
some importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from
a priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter
of no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in
God, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does
not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor
permit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,
almost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade
thrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of
Moses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine's
death-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some
respect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine
was approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*

     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal
     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the
     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were
     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English
     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit
     his (Erving's) father.He heard him say that Paine and he
     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people
     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say
     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville's narrative shows that his
fear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of
Voltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring
priest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to
fear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him
might fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be
left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to
get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without
witnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years
before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic
convictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a
sensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never
told a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly
reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse
Hedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately
thirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the
patient's room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the
Bishop's story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of
any mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one
cannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not
take place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**

     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,
     p.** Bishop Fenwick's narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,
     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be
     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine's adherents were keeping him under the
influence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,
at heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who
had published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the
guillotine.*

     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to
     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the
     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine
     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that
     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject
     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his
     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,
     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and
     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits
     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder
that cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but
his connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they
once idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in
America, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his
biography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last
illness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they
parted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine
only turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to
renew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,
'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition
also, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after
ignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the
"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the
sufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect
with satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food
would stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for
a week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,
and his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death
approached.After the years in which the stories of Paine's wretched
end have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic
lady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a
perfect lady,--that Paine's mind was active to the last, that shortly
before death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died
after a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly
before, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke
about his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame
Bonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received
in her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas
Paine.On June 10th Paine's friends assembled to look on his face for the last
time.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that
of her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;
they could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five
miles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed
Paine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London
Packet:

"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a
gentleman lately returned from a tour: 'On my return from my journey,
when I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom
Paine on the road.The followers were
two <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a
riding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an
Irish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what
funeral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as
his enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends
out by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done
a great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any
purgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil
would let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance
with Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his
horse on a trot, and left me.'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained
Madame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was
Willett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a
good man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine's friends were
glad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all
said about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the
correspondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame
Bonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity
of that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse's head and
followed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,
represented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded
from his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for
the President's intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of
Domingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French
author, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this
country in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next
world with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly
another of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite
Quakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends
refused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,
     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;
but beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic
woman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in
the United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at
the other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,
my son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for
France!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found
in the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:
"Since Mr.Paine's arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way
you very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,
has been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As
to the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious
visitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and
opinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and
with a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him
from those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your
professional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest
and most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing
excelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and
forgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom
he brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,
seemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small
room he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave
with hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him
in 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the
latter end of his life.He

     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,
     Is abandoned in death and interr'd like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some
abuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and
is quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it
branded by the law as the slanderer of a woman's honor, and scourged by
the community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine's death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck
blind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond
his threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The
self-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who
brought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,
nor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine
brought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only
on the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to
recant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded
Paine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire
to be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had
been beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on
Christ?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There
was found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of
Willett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that
she was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord
Jesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has
ever had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book
[the 'Age of Reason']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such
stories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition
of the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities
were printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant
became a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine's
recantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This
     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had
     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of
     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and
     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised
     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that
     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had
     been announced in Paine's obituaries that "some days
     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker
     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but
     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his
     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,
     when Hicks's deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed
     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet's
     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation
     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much
     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no
     object at all!The story was published by one Charles
     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale
     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe
     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection
of Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a
calumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs
surrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book
into the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who
declared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque
superstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,
disgusted thoughtful Christians.*

     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a
     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley
     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his
     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John
     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to
     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of
     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied
     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O'Brian (a
     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,
     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John
     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou 't get thy frying in hell; they 'll roast thee
     like a herring."They 'll put thee in the furnace hot,
     And on thee bar the door:
     How the devils all will laugh
     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine's head, exclaiming,

     "How are the mighty fallen,
     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:
     "Right fol-de-rol, let's dance and sing,
     Tom is dead, God save the king--
     The infidel now low doth lie--
     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,
     "I 'll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine's
heart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his
death, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society
swiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of
Quakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the
separation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded
that "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to
be impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave
of the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those
of any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*

     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William
     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the
     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a
     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock
     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being
     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in
     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip
     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant
     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference
     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:

     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:
     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:
     Where he has gone or how he fares,
     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,
of the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine
rose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one
American religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on
the subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks' region, and mentions
in "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine's friend, Colonel
Fellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:

"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in
Long Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,
earnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my
treasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,
blue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school
gentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;
they used to call him 'Aristides.'I used to chat with him in Tammany
Hall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical
middle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there
was a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for
their work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was
double-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth
and exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine
personally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he
drank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to
think you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement
and the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on
the public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York
he had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his
death a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,
and this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when
the division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett's
conversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the
neighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine's books carefully
and honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine's risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended
recantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the
whole controversy over Paine's works renewed.One after another deist
was sent to prison for publishing Paine's works, the last being Richard
Carlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett
carried Paine's bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely
for this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of
L1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal
victory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that
wealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet
Street, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile's petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the
whole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive
deist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally
atheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by
     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot
     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-
     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in
     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and
     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,
     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a
     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a
     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at
     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner
     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in
     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of
     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,
     Superstition being described as holding

     "in vassalage a doating World,
     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,
     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were
entering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"
were but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations
pronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"
was the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity
diabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country
or any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their
opinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer
Shelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by
Shelley in the struggle for the Englishman's right to read Paine.If
any enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the
godlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for
their opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine
was in every word of Shelley's letter to Lord Ellenborough on the
punishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*

     * "Whence is any right derived, but that which power
     confers, for persecution?Eaton
     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might
     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could
     not believe them except you should make them credible, which
     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God
     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the
     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less
     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does
     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity
     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the
     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,
     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert
     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
     disbelieved the divinity of Christ's mission?...The
     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may
     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the
     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in
     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive
     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and
     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and
again has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on
honest thinkers.In Paine's time the phantasm which was called Jehovah
represented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the
revelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,
slander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented
as crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine's dead
body, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was
proved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who
out-reasoned them.Paine's fidelity to his unanswered argument was
fatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without
reason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"
mainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but
through certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine's peaceful
death, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming
his Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age
of Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,
also a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his
posthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an
organ called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local
organization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge
Hertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected
a monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be
said of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and
forms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The
real cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical
barbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine's bones appear like some page of Mosaic
mythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine's
coffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool
     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was
     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal
     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks
     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with
     Cobbett's effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The
     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they
     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed
     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,
     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas
     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie
     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and
     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent
     inquiries.Of
     Paine's gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his
     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In
     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle
     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to
Cobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on
the island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and
shipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett
gave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.'I
have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:
you have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done
myself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New
Rochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When
I myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of
the great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and
Manchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will
effect the reformation of England in Church and State.'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett's workmen
while they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that
Paine's little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once
small movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused
him a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,
no man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world
which he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been
born in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that
heart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter
of fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the
papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary
of Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,
November 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become
the citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for
America.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary
talents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted
with the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of
the French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He
thus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George
Chalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the
statements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in
Philadelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had
been deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
published in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was
"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted
the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the
next year.The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and his _Register_
was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,
because he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age
having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical
politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are
generously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her
nephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his
intention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with
Madame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame
Bonneville had been disposing of some of Paine's manuscripts, such as
that on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in
_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her
husband's assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the
"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et
l'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her
a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important
letters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)
her conditions, that it should be published in England, without any
addition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or
all of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing
except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by
brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame
Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
letters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists
among the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,
where they kept a small book shop.His biography
in Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that
in 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous
papers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained
the manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville
emigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,
lived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,
and to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal
Cheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with
the result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett
did not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such
conditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that
were never sent.The recollections are those of both M.
and Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out
the parts that represent Madame's personal knowledge and reminiscences,
as Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with
characteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important
points.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do
beyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters
indicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,
etc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by
any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
still a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
from his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is
reserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the
characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor
of Bonneville's surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
editing the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This
was Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused
his denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now
wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
of the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,
in the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy
of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against
royalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising
his benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against
Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and
arrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the
police his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by
Fouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,
and that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,
America."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were
connected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due
to their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards
the close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to
his widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do
for a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published
heresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
tracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,
that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
County of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that
his father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that
his mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged
to the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards
became a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,
as appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a
     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed
     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man
     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made
     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,
     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction
     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the
     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,
     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have
     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the
statement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the
free-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen
years of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a
year afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:
that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he
afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759
and 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher
to a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and
separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*

     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories
     require revision by the light of the careful researches made
     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this
     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from
England for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his
history; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever
we find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d'un
grand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge
of a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might
have been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was
quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,
and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They
disliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of
grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was
reconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived
them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of
hostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the
parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no
thoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had
any talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have
continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them
into action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy
wished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just
set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was
time for every man to stir."*

     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for
young ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then
little known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he
undertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
slavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also
stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he
joined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history
of the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:
[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one
else-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]

When Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine
published the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every
corporal's guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members
of the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in
number, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in
all directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,
owing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the
robberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the
Congress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed
for France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the
Congress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he
received the following letter from Col.Laurens:

"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention
my horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by
mismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and
I am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat
your acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in
bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with
open arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are
anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
particular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common
between us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
and published.Nathaniel Greene:

"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you
into this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome
acknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think
you have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few
characters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and
not to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for
your writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;
nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride
and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation
happy."'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
useful to the country.**

At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,
Bordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had
bought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,
Bordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
received in the same month.He carried with him the model of
a bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in
a drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he
went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went
to Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge
was cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas
Paine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,
1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the
Rights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to
about a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,
McDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two
Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and
of Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the
following letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de
Sechelles:

"To Thomas Paine:

"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire
among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences
of those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that
Common Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
conception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen
with pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate
authority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before
you were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an
observer and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people
who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword
of the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens
turned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and
collects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of
genius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to
give to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty
and happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the
first to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that
honour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of
your election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at
Mr.Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure
of knowing you."Herault,

"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine
at the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,
gave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,
though a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not
forget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United
States of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude
would not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of
Louis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**

     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when
the greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
retired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy
against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of
some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
their horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined
themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
most valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed
himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he
could not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly
destined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked
enemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed
among the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the
Luxembourg in December 1793.|

From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,
for a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre
took place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote
to Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter
to Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter
from Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote
a memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he
_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months
of imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially
offered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called
him to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he
alleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
Aristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared
     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some
     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:

"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind
visit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,
however, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your
being set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,
who arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment's
consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my
life remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected
me, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am
exceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from
her who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of
citizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,
nor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,

"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
of the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to
Gen.Monroe entreated him not to
send it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was
afterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him
with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity
of a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when
he was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless
child who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was
the famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his
side.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being
very sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent
nurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account
in itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and
kindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]
Committee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read
it in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and
published in London; but, the language of the author has been changed
by the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of
Finance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
Washington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a
newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
the same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and
who wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore
we suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in
doing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the
Convention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,
October 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of
Reason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did
not, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great
number of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore
came back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13
April 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr.B.
spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a
reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a
week or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was
occupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;
and Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
bed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting
at meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from
which, though he understood but little of the French language when
spoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating
to politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his
morning's reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,
and they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by
the bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on
foot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not
believe he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of
his stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a
wholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than
that they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical
invention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without
his receiving many visits.Smith [Sir
Robert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;
and, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great
reputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors
with civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation
was mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to
him, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain
themselves with their own ideas.Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house
in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here
learnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out
after dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or
three hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he
often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was
seldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by
seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his
countrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always
performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely
means to secure success.He wrote as
follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment
of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine
published, on this occasion, a letter to C.*

     * The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are
     here crossed out by Madame Bonneville.258
     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a
bridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been
adopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He
employed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to
high perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,
and according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/
moulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the
form that he required.Though
he fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce
arguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often
demonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone
in doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his
bridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of
hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be
sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied
without admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and
were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his bridge:
come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as
to please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw
the sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in
the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy
compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he
had executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine
being put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed
boards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification
of the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together
with a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at
Washington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to
obtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of
Madam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial
on the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the
two pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon

and Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of
Talma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at

     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed
     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of
     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
see Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of
the Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he
got up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave
the mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your
religion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville's journal
(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*

     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several
     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with
     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith's
[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he
was neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it
was not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air
to the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with
the following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry
than the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be
gallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs
to the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new
covenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little
Corner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is
agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real
republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly
grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the
six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
that he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of
great consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit
France; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,
many of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure
of Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,
relying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America
justified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked
at Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of
Baltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he
landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but
a few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters
to the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter
of 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,
where a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City
Hotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some
friends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The
letter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
accepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of
paralytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had
the same while at Mr.Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from
prison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of
the winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the
spring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm
for 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill
for fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which
Paine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and
other necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
to cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
place, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,
on Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr.Paine being in his
room, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the
window.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,
and all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day
discovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,
fell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,
and left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and
there (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the
muzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that
Christopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening
before, and had returned it again before six o'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately
and voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;
and Derick was acquitted.*

     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in
     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New
     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being
a citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The
letters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80
of this volume_..]

This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as
his legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an
undoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
made him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:

"My dear Bonneville: Why don't you come to America Your wife and two
boys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak
English very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide
for the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by
Madget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English
woman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
Institute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:

"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also
the letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written
to the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to
interest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of
your coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
American Minister from Mr.As soon as you
receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of
the proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,
who succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting
the iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what
vessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best
place to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may
contrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the
Spring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often
less."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,
Gregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I
have yet in manuscript, by subscription."*

     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame
     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true
     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a
     slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory.The minister who
     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The
     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary
     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to
     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
called, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great
importance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;
and Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,
said: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to
tell you, that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you 'll be
dammed.""Poh, poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with
such an impertinent message.God would not send
such a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;
be off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
New York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had
in 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
increased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a
memorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for
his services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on
the same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as
follows.*

     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking
     oat Cobbett's words, "will be found in the Appendix."The
     documents and letters are not given, but they are well
     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,
passed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave
to withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He
was deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing
himself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were
greatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,
while he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a
very great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no
interest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them
another will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his
friend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also
altered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before
his death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and
gave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it
than any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a
member of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we
were looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs
of our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his
affairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;
his father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a
grave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which
he seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the
interview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be
buried on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the
farm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half
rotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I
assure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be
sold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I
have been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between
my children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
whereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously
recommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I
am dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time
after, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of
sorrow, "you will have nothing left."*

     * Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton
     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a
     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a
     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide
     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,
     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance
     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South
     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given
     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and
     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to
     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them
     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct
     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At
     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father
     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in
     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his
     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of
     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone
     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and
     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides
     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and
     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I
     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I
     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect
     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,
     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas
     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no
     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much
     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes
     me that so little is known of Paine's benefactions, that
     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that
     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French
     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the
     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to
     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily
departed from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in
bed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes
write.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the
newspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the
press after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took
great interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always
so strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He
never complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of
his sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged
to sustain during his illness, in a carman's house [Ryder's] in a small
village [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose
confidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of
his sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;
but, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are
nothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and
you don't come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this
time, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever
returned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high
price for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This
must be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the
neighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,
after which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble
about anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though
Dr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had
commenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been
so officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless
he was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The
next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and
they resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his
death, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don't think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is
you Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such
business.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly
diminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had
     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;
     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine
     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even
     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and
to talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good
morning."One of his friends
came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom
seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,
if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,
upon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but
they were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to
the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed
so much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent
the night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock,
after a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from
the city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a
portrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was
executed.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany
coffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the
coffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck
and wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put
under his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the
coffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose
in my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not
disfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was
not wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,
oh, lord help me!He
groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered
the question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;
but the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,
walking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he
was desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be
the place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in
execution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the
following inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died
the eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall
twelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been
planted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many
persons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in
memory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain
these memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have
been put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been
written on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the
farm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
feeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,
I, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My
son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for
France!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and
philosopher!**

     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been
     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,
     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of
     Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on
     Paine's grave.It is satisfactory to find another
     interpretation.** Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave
     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,
     introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine with the words: "as
     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham
     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine's]
     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for
     carrying the dead, to Potter's Field; a white man drove the
     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole
     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's Field.Such
     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an
acre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been
sold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,
which was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in
lots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece
of land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine's posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer
to Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces
on Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous
political works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences
cannot be, as yet, published.*

In _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of
a machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the
Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
disorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that
it was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding
him as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character
according to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
about five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;
and his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;
in which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of
reproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told
us that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to
deceive him].***

     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,
     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as
     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of
     Paine's bridges.In this paragraph and some
     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,
     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an
affectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and
foot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or
affectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with
his hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His
countenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving
salutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he
did not begin with "how d' ye do?"If they had
none, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his
eye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened
to over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their
paper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of
jobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the
sure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,
concealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret
pay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or
private meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he
longed for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he
added that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,
beforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would
take place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the
clear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not
for him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past
and consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to
open day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,
and with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is
almost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,
whom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the
clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he
wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his
vehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place
where you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to
envy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he
thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do
you think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General
Gates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have
always had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you
were married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General
went on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent
questions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
wailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking
of the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did
they go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and
settled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice
and in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the
manly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow's letter [i. e. to
     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him
he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of
a treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
him.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully
seized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular
traits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of
witticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in
the same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place
where he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it
too circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions
well brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes
of which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,
rendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more
endearing.Politics were his favorite subject
He never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never
disputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could
understand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it
when on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke
on dramatic subjects.He did
not like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the
mind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the
affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political
discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he
was always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his
pamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and
steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an
instant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who
listens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his
contemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which
makes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas
Paine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited
the Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in
spite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame
Bonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer
of Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
Cobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS

In 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated
from Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,
who found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,
Dr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall's
journals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers
are of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall's entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never
dreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely
been secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by
this work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the
excellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in
New Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the
relatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,
merits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the
exhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is
amongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board
the same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their
acquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides
now in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him
before it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is
sure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his
circumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for
him he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us
of his coming this day.Kerbright
[Kirkbride], and another gentleman came to our door in a waggon.Pain told us a tale of the Indians, he being at a
meeting of them with others to settle some affairs in 1776.Pain's--not to give a deciding opinion between
two persons you are in friendship with, lest you lose one by it; whilst
doing that between two persons, your supposed enemies, may make one your
friend.With much pain drawd the Board in at Hanna's chamber window to
work Mr.I pinned 6 more arches together which makes
the whole 9.Pain gives me some wine and water as I
was very dry.[The December journal is mainly occupied with mention of Paine's
visitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert
Morris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is
mentioned.]Franklin today;
staid till after tea in the evening.They tried the burning of our
candles by blowing a gentle current through them.The draught of air is prevented by passing through a cold
tube of tallow.The tin of the new lamp by internal reflections is
heated and causes a constant current This is the Doctor's conjecture.[Concerning Paine's candle see i., p.We sent to all the places we could
suppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy
fearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to
bed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of
machine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme
to H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused
saint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,
but I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John
     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of
     much interest.The first steamer seems
     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka
Nation, I gladly assented.Paine wished
to see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common
Sense, and was introduced into the room, addressed them as "brothers"
and shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose
family I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home
here I am diligently employed in Saint making, now in Iron that I had
before finished in wood, with some improvements, but you may come and
see what it is.Skepticism and Credulity are as general here as
elsewhere, for what I see.In this town is a Quaker meeting and one of
another class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a
Tailor by trade that goes about a-soulmending on Sundays to various
places, as most necessary, or I suppose advantageous, to himself; for by
one trade or the other he has built himself a very elegant frame house
in this town.This man's way to Heaven is somewhat different to the
other.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c. My Employer has
_Common Sense enough_ to disbelieve most of the Common Systematic
Theories of Divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself.The
Colonel [Kirkbride] is as Free as John Coltman.[Under date of New York, July 31st, Hall writes an account of a journey
with Paine to Morrisania, to visit Gen.Morris, and afterwards to the
farm at New Rochelle, of which he gives particulars already known to my
reader.]Letter of Paine to John Hall, at Capt.Coltman's, in Letitia Court,
Market St, between Front and Second St.Philadelphia:

"Bordentown, Sep.22, 1786.--Old Friend: In the first place I have
settled with Mr.Gordon for the time he has been in the house--in the
second I have put Mrs.Read who, you know has part of our house Col.Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession by putting
part of her goods into it.* By this means we shall have room at our
house (Col.Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations.As Philadelphia
is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm.Foulke's would
not be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you
here.Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the
choice of both her and Col.I wish you could
come up to-morrow (Sunday) and bring the iron with you.I shall be
backward and forward between here and Philadelphia pretty often until
the elections are over, but we can make a beginning here and what more
iron we may want we can get at the Delaware Works, and if you should
want to go to Mount hope you can more conveniently go from here than
from Philadelphia--thus you see I have done your business since I
have been up.Henry who is member for
Lancaster County.I do not know where he lodges, but if William will
be so good as to give it to the door keeper or Clerk of the Assembly it
will be safe.Read was thus transferred to Paine's own house.Her
     husband died next year and Paine declined to receive any
     rent.Your coming here will give an opportunity to Joseph to get acquainted
with Col.K. who will very freely give any information in his power.servt"

Undated letter of Paine to John Hall, in Philadelphia:

"Fryday Noon.--Old Friend: Inclosed (as the man said by the horse) I
send you the battau, as I wish to present it as neat and clean as can be
done; I commit it to your care.The sooner it is got on Board the vessel
the better.I shall set off from here on Monday and expect to be in New
York on Tuesday.I shall take all the tools that are here with me and
wish you would take some with you, that if we should get on a working
fit we may have some to work with.Let me hear from you by the Sunday's
boat and send me the name of the vessel and Captain you go with and what
owners they belong to at New York, or what merchants they go to.I wrote
to you by the last boat, and Peter tells me he gave the letter to Capt.Haines, but Joe says that he enquired for letters and was told there was
none--wishing you an agreeable voyage and meeting at New York, I am your
friend, and humble servant.Kirkbride's and Polly's compt."3 (1786) "Dashwood Park, of Captain Roberts: On
Thursday morning early Sept.28th I took the stage wagon for Trenton.Jo
had gone up by water the day before to a sale of land and a very capital
iron works and nailing with a large corn mill.It was a fair sale there
was a forge and rolling and slitting mill upon an extensive scale the
man has failed--The works with about 60 or 70 acres of land were sold
for L9000 currency.Then was put up about 400 acres of land and sold for
L2700 currency and I believe a good bargain; and bought by a friend of
mine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it
when he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and
they came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys
to find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to
Bordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine's purchase along
with him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble's applying to
Dr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation
having formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and
wished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that
Britain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King
a million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth
overshoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove
stand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine's desire and found it kept my feet
warm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine's
horse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold
and silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and
punching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride
and Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about
the Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments
again and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?
]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,
and when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong
cords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the
other.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that
and words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when
I left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill
used in this affair.We arrived
in town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went
down to Dr.Franklin's, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called
on me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of
the value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of
any of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of
Doctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed
for power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that
he had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed
as nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them
and helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to
examine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency
for the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would
require,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed
until tomorrow.Pain's letter read, and leave given to exhibit the
Bridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]
upon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk
beyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus
is.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a
dispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were
very high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the
Bank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a
reflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable
time, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went
down; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and
what he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with
the several parties.Pain in some things
relating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground
when any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in
difficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The
Captain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying
the model to the State House.Franklin's and fetched the
Bridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and
there placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this
Speaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an
early riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until
he came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker
inspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen
and even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as
different as their features.The philosopher said it would add new
light to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)
remarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by
stand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and
all the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by
an Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt
and realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13
feet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the
world's present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly
for a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to
be put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the
interest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have
erected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more
than pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal
stockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;
I gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day's work and a pair of
gloves.Paine's boy called on time to [inquire] of the money
spent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several
visitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.

Sunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine's horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy
country arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o'clock for dinner.This
is the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street
with a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,
so followed him up to Collins's, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight's Tavern, and
there he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going
for England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th
instant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in
and he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return
on meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee's
proceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had
sent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to
the Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in
France.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full
of employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors
on State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,
could hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he
considers Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to
write by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons
above.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen
letters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the
Doctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of
many aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the
treaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding
an article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability
of it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the
French minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he
would make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were
so fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint
from a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by
endeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from
amongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity
was as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as
necessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many
more hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then
shook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,
Leicester, England:

"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that
he has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he
think I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did
not I send you word it was General Washington's.And does he think I
shall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him
the first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my
setting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I 'll
haul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New
Jersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their
chairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend's
one Mrs.Morgan's and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of
a servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;
he walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and
some plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done
in their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was
necessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would
lend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as
related to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I
believe that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested
miracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to
deem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for
these 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington's great
coat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said
coat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should
expect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having
a chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,
and sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime
hence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be
disputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date
and of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard
to them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for
the above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I
strictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If
not------

"My best wishes to you all,

"John Hall."John
Coltman's, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear
that our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has
been put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now
taken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel
furnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of
iron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded
with six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present
I am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work
(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce
something one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but
there is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of
John Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was
done before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest
run of anything ever published in this country, at least of late
years--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty
thousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now
gone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been
applied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but
I intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have
handsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand
copies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I
do not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at
St.Jefferson who mentioned
the great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who
has brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote
under the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for
me from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me
(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before
you leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P. S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst.it which is more than I have done by any other--were I to ans.all the letters I receive--I should require half a dozen clerks."Extracts from John Hall's letters from London, England: London, January
1792 Burke's publication has produced one way or other near 50 different
answers and publications.Nothing of late ever has been so read as
Paine's answer.Sometime shortly he will publish a second part of the
Rights of Man.His first part was scrutinized by the Privy Council
held on purpose and through fear of making him more popular deemed too
contemptible for Government notice.The sale of it for a day or two was
rather retarded or not publickly disposed of until it was known by the
printers that it would not be noticed by Government.John Hall to a friend in England:

"London, Nov.I dined yesterday with the Revolution Society at
the London Tavern.A very large company assembled and after dinner
many truly noble and patriotic toasts were drank.The most prominent
were--The Rights of Man--with 3 times &c.--The Revolution of France--The
Revolution of the World--May all the armies of tyrants learn the
Brunswick March--May the tree of Liberty be planted in every tyrant
city, and may it be an evergreen.The utmost unanimity prevailed through
the company, and several very excellent songs in favor of Liberty
were sung.Every bosom felt the divine glow of patriotism and love
of universal freedom.For my part I was
transported at the scene.It happened that a company of Aristocratic
french and Spanish merchants were met in the very room under, and
Horne Tooke got up and sarcastically requested the company not to wound
the tender feelings of the gentlemen by too much festivity.This sarcasm
was followed by such a burst of applause as I never before heard."From J. Redman, London, Tuesday Dec.18, 5 p. m. to John Hall,
Leicester, England: "Mr.Erskine

closed his speech the venal jury interrupted the Attorney General, who

my indignant feelings on this occasion.At this moment, while I write,

At the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but
after his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height
was five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,
it is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine's mouth was
delicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble
with age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head
long, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man
who has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation
on the brilliancy of Paine's eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its
elegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he
is shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may
judge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,
on which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an
unwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a
death-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used
on the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some
idea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture
said to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in
Philadelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,
for Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard
University, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted
another portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There
must have been an early engraving from one of Peale's pictures, for John
Hall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my
friends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,
but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis
portrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of
Philadelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of
Man," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand
and pens rests Paine's right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The
full face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of
the queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress
is neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it
is rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large
wristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with
     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a
     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him
a note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,
concerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not
as a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the
disposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have
possessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I
incline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now
in this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical
portraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,
Robespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille
Desmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These
pictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France
during the Revolution.Lowry, of
South Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At
the beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at
Williamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed
to Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,
until purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of
Syracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been
begun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of
Paine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture
is about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an
elegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from
the knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the
same room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that
further light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville
Paine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,
the publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in
1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is
described in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would
mean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly
in December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,
however, have been then taken, on account of Paine's imprisonment and
illness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to
reside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable
picture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and
expressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical
with that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George
Romney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_
after the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up
in Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp's
engraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the
smaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for
Cheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not
to have got into Gilbert Vale's popular biography of Paine.That and
a reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine's works, have
spread through this country something little better than a caricature;
and one Sweden has subjected Truelove's edition, in England, to a
like misfortune.Paine's friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were
satisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake's
library a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back
by Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all
his vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as
it is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville
found in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter's "History of England,"
and published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,
Paine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights
of Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked
"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good

A miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.
Mackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British
Library, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it
"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in
Vale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace
of its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have
been made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for
popular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily
long, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical
leader.Before speaking of Jarvis' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later
one by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my
collection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his
death.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.
W. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born
at Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New
York, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the
Americas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a
dove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book
inscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll
with "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays
break out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the
balances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the
United States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,
crown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a
plumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by
a pen, on Paine's breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom's
Wreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The
wreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following
names: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;
Barlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.
Home Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,
as compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent
expression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of
the original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily
have fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for
Paine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the
impression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two
years later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I
saw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It
reveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man's
power.After Paine's death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence
Hutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the
establishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used
by George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the
bust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in
the New York Historical Society's rooms.In an article on Paine in the
_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden
by the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an
Investigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the
statement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire
collection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but
from no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The
face is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal
misrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except
that in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of
Paine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies
convince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John
Wesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of
New York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to
be a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an
inscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine
now in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been
engraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only
can convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing
the strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now
drawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now
flushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,
the firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.Pork
and lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much
cleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.Hall was no
vegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia
beef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the
family with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her
life was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid
economy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she
worked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was
always substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a
hand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for
several winters Mrs.In
1872 she was “Directress” of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and
for a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,
having charge of a section of the city near her residence.For the last
fourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>
Women and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors
regarded her with much esteem.She listened to their stories of
distress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her
warm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in
their hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle
Louis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with
a grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.And “the
Uncle Louis grape” was the best in the garden.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen
Irish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite
for whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for
liquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took
little Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,
with the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and
soon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of
philanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with
the devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from
the first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was
always enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his
“_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,” Professor Hall
chivalrously says:

    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the
    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of
    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a
    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the
    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various
    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that
    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so
    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the
    encouragement of my wife.Each night she sent her
husband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each
night she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember
the excitement at home.There was a great secret in the house, and all
the members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual
confidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been
referred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in
Rodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in
the summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney
family.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six
children, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in
the summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt
Angeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,
who had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the
Stickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the
summer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline’s death.It was a goodly
sight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and
when, at Elmina’s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the
needs of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, “Take
care, old lady!” She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed
almost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father
well, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New
Hampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her
exclamations of “Fiddlesticks,” and “Witch-cats,” were quaint and
picturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her
descent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in
New England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New
England in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she
found her grandfather Cook’s first cousin, Mr.He was then
one hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go
skating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!I
remember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of
eleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him
describe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but
active and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands
with the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of
Charlton, Mass.At the close of life she longed to
visit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her
native country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.In
1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to
Colorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before
they had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte’s people
in Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack
habit.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding
winter, she was staying with a cousin’s son, a country doctor, in
Washington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of
the Adirondacks.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor’s
family, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.Her
improvement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three
sons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,
camping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,
setting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing
north of the mountains to Paul Smith’s, and thence to Saranac Lake
village, John Brown’s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning
by way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest
sons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the
summer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day
I escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the
mountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the
summit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning
another Adirondack trip when death overtook her—at the house of her
friend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem “Heracles,” written towards the close of her career, fittingly
describes her own herculean labors:

                               HERACLES.I.

           Genius of labor, mighty Heracles!Though bound by fate to do another’s will,
           Not basely, as a slave, dost thou fulfil
           The appointed task.The eye of God to please
           Thou seekest, and man to bless, and not thy ease.So to thy wearying toil thou addest still
           New labors, to redeem some soul from ill,
           Performing all thy generous mind conceives.From the sea-monster’s jaws thy arm did free,
           And from her chains, the fair Hesione.And when Alcestis, who her lord to save,
           Her life instead a sacrifice she gave,
           Then wast thou near with heart that never quailed,
           And o’er Death’s fearful form thy might prevailed.Because thou chosest virtue, when for thee
            Vice her alluring charms around thee spread,
            The gods, approving, smiled from overhead,
            And gave to thee thy shining panoply.Nature obedient to thy will was led,
            Out rushed the rivers from their ancient bed
            And washed the filth of earth into the sea.When ’gainst thy foes thy arrows all were spent,
            Zeus stones instead, in whirling snow-cloud sent.When with sore heat oppressed, O wearied one!Thou thought’st to aim thy arrows at the sun,
            Then Helios sent his golden boat to thee
            To bear thee safely through the trackless sea.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XVI.––––––
                          A BUNDLE OF LETTERS.The letters of Angeline Hall are genuine letters—not meant for
publication, but for the eyes of the persons addressed.The style, even
the spelling and punctuation, are faulty; and the subject-matter in most
cases can have no general interest.However, I have selected a few of
her letters, which I trust will be readable, and which may help to give
a truer conception of the astronomer’s wife:

                                                   RODMAN, July 26, ’66.DEAREST ASAPH: I am at Mother’s this morning.Staid over to help see
    to Ruth, and now cannot get back over to Elminas, all so busy at
    their work, have no time to carry me, then Franklin is sick half the
    time.I shall probably get over there in a day or two.I have had no
    letters from you since a week ago last night, have had no
    opportunity to send to the Office.Franklin has finished his haying but
    has a little hoing to do yet—Constant is trying to get his work
    along so that he will be ready to take you around when you come.He
    wishes you to write when you will come so that he can arrange his
    work accordingly.I hope you will come by the middle of August.He thinks you
    have forsaken him.When I ask him now where is papa, he says “no
    papa.” I have weaned him.He stayed with Aunt Mary three nights
    while I was taking care of Ruth.He eats his bread and milk very
    well now.Little “A” has been a very good boy indeed, a real little
    man.I bought him and Homer some nice bows and arrows of an Indian
    who brought them into the cars to sell just this side of Rome, so
    that he shoots at a mark with Grandfather Woodward.I suppose Adelaide starts for Goshen next week.I have received two
    letters from her.Now do come up here as soon as you can.I do not enjoy my visit half
    so well without you.I am going out with Mary after raspberries this
    morning—Little Samie is very fond of them.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.28 (1868)

    DEAR SISTER MARY, Little Angelo is only twelve days old, but he is
    as bright and smart as can be.I have washed and dressed him for
    four days myself.I have been down to the gate to-day.And have
    sewed most all day, so you see I am pretty well.To day is Samie’s birthday, four years old—he is quite well and
    happy—The baby he says is his.I should like very much to take a peep at you in
    your new home.We like our old place better and
    better all the time.You must write to me as soon as you can.Do you
    get your mail at Adams Centre?Have you any apples in that vicinity
    this year?Hall has just been reading in the newspaper a sketch of Henry
    Keep’s life which says he was once in the Jefferson Co.Poor house,
    is it true?Much love to you all

                ANGELINE HALL.GEORGETOWN March 3rd 1871

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We received your letter, also the tub of apples
    and cider.I have made some apple sauce, it is splendid.I have not
    had one bit of boiled cider apple sauce before since we came to
    Washington.I shall try to pay you for all your expense and trouble
    sometime.I would send you some fresh shad if I was sure it would
    keep to get to you.We had some shad salted last spring but it is
    not very nice.I think was not put up quite right, so it is hardly
    fit to send.Samie has had a little ear-ache this week but
    is better.Angelo is the nicest little boy you ever saw.A man came to spade the ground to sow
    our peas but it began to rain just as he got here, so we shall have
    to wait a few days.My crocuses and daffodils are budded to blossom,
    and the sweet-scented English violets are in bloom, filling the
    parlors here with fragrance.We
    do not have to wait for it, but before we are aware it is here.I think we shall make you a little visit this
    summer.How are Father and Mother and Constant and yourself?Much
    love to you all from all of us.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.18th ’74

    DEAR SISTER MARY: I am getting very anxious to hear from you.Little
    “A” commenced a letter to you during his vacation, and copied those
    verses you sent so as to send the original back to you.But he did
    not finish his letter and I fear he will not have time to write
    again for some time as his studies take almost every minute he can
    spare from eating and sleeping.Baby grows smart
    and handsome all the time.Angelo keeps fat and rosy though we have to be careful of him.Samie
    is getting taller and taller, and can not find time to play enough.Mother Hall is with us this winter, is helping me about the sewing.You
    must dress warm so as not to take cold.Have you got any body to
    help you this winter?Has Salina gone to the
    music school?Must write to Elmina in a day or
    two.The baby thinks Granpa’s saw-man is the nicest thing he can find.Angelo is so choice of it he will not let him touch it often.Affectionately

                ANGELINE.GEORGETOWN March 22nd [1877 probably]

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We are working on our grounds some as the weather
    permits.It will be very pretty here when we get it done.And our
    house is as convenient as can be now.Tell Mother I have set out a
    rose bush for her, and am going to plant one for Grandma Hall too.Samie has improved a great deal the last year, he is getting stout
    and tall.Angelo is as fat as a pig and as keen as a knife.Percy is
    a real nice little boy, he has learned most of his letters.will go ahead of his Father yet if he keeps his health.I never
    saw a boy of his age study as he does, every thing must be right,
    and be understood before he will go an inch.I am pretty well, but have to be careful, if I get sick a little am
    sure to have a little malarial fever.Much love to you all and write soon telling me how Mother is.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.13th 1881

    DEAR ASAPH, Yesterday we buried Nellie over in the cemetery on
    Grandfather’s old farm in Rodman.You can not think how beautiful
    and grand she looked.She had improved very much since she was at
    our house, and I see she had many friends.I think she was a
    superior girl, but too sensitive and ambitious to live in this world
    so cramped and hedged about.She went down to help Mary, and Mr.Wright’s people came for her to go up and help them as Mrs.Wright
    was sick, so Nellie went up there and washed and worked very hard
    and came back to Mary’s completely exhausted, and I think she had a
    congestive chill to begin with and another when she died.The little boys and I are at Elminas.I came over to rest a little,
    am about used up.One of the neighbors has just come over saying
    that Mary died last night at nine o’clock, and will be buried
    to-morrow.So to-morrow morning I suppose I shall go back over to
    Constant’s, do not know how long I shall stay there.I wish to know how you are getting on at home.With Much Love

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not know whether I had better go home, or try to stay
    here and rest, I am so miserably tired.THE OLD BRICK, GOSHEN
                                     9 A.M.Monday Morning July 14, 1884

    DEAR ASAPH: I have just got through the morning’s work.Got up at
    half past five, built the fire, got the breakfast which consisted of
    cold roast beef, baked potatoes, Graham gems, and raspberries and
    cream.Percie got up with me and went for the berries, Angelo went over to
    his Uncle Lyman’s for the milk and cream, and Samie went out into
    the garden to work.After breakfast
    all the boys went to the garden, Samie and Percie to kill potato
    bugs and Angelo to pick the peas for dinner.Samie has just come in
    to his lessons.Angelo is not quite through, Percie is done.I have
    washed the dishes and done the chamber work.Now I have some mending
    and a little ironing to do.I have done our washing so far a little
    at a time.I washed some Saturday so I have the start of the common
    washer-women and iron Monday.I suppose at home you have got
    somebody to wait on you all round, and then find it hard work to
    live.I have mastered the situation here, though it has been very
    hard for two weeks, and have got things clean and comfortable.The old brick and mortar though, fall down freely whenever one
    raises or shuts a window, or when the wind slams a door, as it often
    does here in this country of wind.It was showery Friday and Saturday afternoon
    and some of his hay got wet.Next month Lyman is to take the superintendency of the Torrington
    creamery much to the discomfiture of Mary.[Professor Hall’s brother
    Lyman married Mary Gilman, daughter of Mrs.He made
    no arrangements as to stated salary.Mary is trying to have that
    fixed and I hope she will.I think he had better come up here and stay with
    us awhile if his health does not improve very soon.Adelaide is staying with Dine during her vacation, they both came up
    here last Tuesday, stayed to dinner, brought little Mary.I have not
    seen Mary Humphrey yet.[Adelaide and Adeline, twins, and Mary
    Humphrey were Professor Hall’s sisters.]But the boys saw her the
    Fourth.Affectionately

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not think best for A. to go to Pulkowa.17th 1887

    MY DEAR BOYS [Samuel and Angelo at college] We received Angelo’s
    letter the first of the week and were very glad to get such a nice
    long letter and learn how strong you were both growing.I left for New Haven two weeks ago this morning; had a pleasant
    journey.I had a room on Wall street not far
    from the College buildings, so it was a long way to the Observatory
    and I did not get up to the Observatory till Sunday afternoon, as A.
    wanted to sleep in the mornings.Friday A. drove me up to East Rock,
    which overlooks the city, the sea and the surrounding country.Elkins and after tea, a
    pleasant little party gathered there.Newton came and
    took me to hear President Dwight preach, in the afternoon A. and I
    went to Mrs.Winchesters to see the beautiful flowers in the green
    houses, then we went to Prof.Marshes, after which we went to Miss
    Twinings to tea then to Prof.Monday I went up to the
    Observatory and mended a little for A. then went to Dr.Leighton’s
    to tea and afterwards to a party at Mrs.I forgot to
    say that Monday morning Mrs.Wright came for me and we went through
    Prof.Wright’s physical Laboratory, then to the top of the Insurance
    building with Prof.Newton to get a view of the city.Tuesday
    morning I went up to the Observatory again and mended a little more
    for A., then went down to dinner and at about half past two left for
    New York where I arrived just before dark, went to the Murray Hill
    Hotel, got up into the hall on the way to my room and there met Dr.Peters, who said that father was around somewhere, after awhile he
    came.Wednesday I went to the meeting of the Academy.Draper gave a
    supper, and before supper Prof.Pickering read a paper on his
    spectroscopic work with the Draper fund, and showed pictures of the
    Harvard Observatory, and of the spectra of stars etc.Thursday it rained all day, but I went to the Academy meeting.Friday a number of the members of the Academy together with Mrs.Draper and myself went over to Llewellyn Park to
    see Edison’s new phonograph.Saturday morning your father and I went to the museum and saw the
    statuary and paintings there, and left Jersey City about 2 P.M.for
    home, where we arrived at about half past eight: We had a pleasant
    time, but were rather tired.Percie and all are well as usual.Aunt
    Charlotte is a great deal better.Aunt Ruth has not gone to
    Wisconsin.I guess she will
    send some of it to Homer to come home with.Jasper has left home
    again said he was going to Syracuse.Aunt Ruth has trouble enough,
    says she has been over to Elmina’s, and David does not get up till
    breakfast time leaving E. to do all the chores I suppose.She writes
    that Leffert Eastman’s wife is dead, and their neighbor Mr.Now I must close my diary or I shall not get it into the office
    to-night.I am putting down carpets and am very busy

            With love

                C. A. S. HALL.12th ’88

    MY DEAR ANGELO AND PERCIVAL [at college],... Sam.is reading
    Goethe’s Faust aloud to me when I can sit down to sew, and perhaps I
    told you that he is helping me to get things together for my
    Prometheus Unbound.He is translating now Aeschylos’ fragments for I
    wish to know as far as possible how Aeschylos treated the subject.I
    have a plan all my own which I think a good one, and have made a
    beginning.I know I shall have to work hard if I write any thing
    good, but am willing to work.On the next day after
    Thanksgiving our Historical Society begins its work.With love

                C. A. S. HALL.8th, 1890

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival], I arrived here safely early this
    afternoon.Miss Waitt and I had a very pleasant drive on Thursday.Stopped at the John Brown place for
    lunch, then drove over to Lake Placid, we went up to the top of the
    tower at Grand View House and had a good look at the mountains and
    the lake as far as we could see it there.Then we passed on to
    Wilmington Notch which I think much finer than any mountain pass
    which I have before seen.We went on to Wilmington and stayed over
    night.There was a hard shower before breakfast, but the rain
    stopped in time for the renewal of our journey.We arrived at Au
    Sable Chasm a little after noon on Saturday.The Chasm is very
    picturesque but not so grand as the Wilmington Pass.We saw the
    falls in the Au Sable near the Pass; there are several other falls
    before the river reaches the Chasm.From the Chasm we went on to
    Port Kent where Miss Waitt took the steamer for Burlington, and
    where I stayed over night.In the morning I took the steamer for
    Ticonderoga.We plunged into a fog which shut out all view till we
    neared Burlington, when it lifted a little.After a while it nearly
    all went away, and I had a farewell look of the mountains as we
    passed.It began to rain before we reached Ticonderoga but we got a
    very good view of the old Fort.I thought of Asaph Hall the first,
    and old Ethan Allen, and of your great great grandfather David Hall
    whose bones lie in an unknown grave somewhere in the vicinity.The steamer goes south only to Ticonderoga; and there I took the
    cars for Whitehall where I found my cousin Elizabeth Benjamin
    seemingly most happy to see me.She is an intelligent woman though
    she has had very little opportunity for book learning.She has a
    fine looking son at Whitehall.It will soon be time for you to leave Keene.I think it would be
    well for you to pack your tent the day before you go if you can
    sleep one night in the large tent.Of course the tent should be dry
    when it is packed if possible, otherwise you will have to dry it
    after you get to Cambridge.Remember to take all the things out of
    my room there.The essence of peppermint set near the west window.They are all well here at the Borsts.I shall go up to Aunt Elmina’s this week.Love to all,

                C. A. S. HALL.2715 N Street [same as 18 Gay St]
                                         WASHINGTON D.C.March 28th 1891

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival at college],... I am sorry the
    Boston girl is getting to be so helpless.I think all who have to
    keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on
    the first steamer.I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls.I
    have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and
    Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute.Stanton’s advice to her sons, “When
    you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.” Now I
    think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone.As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there
    may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago;
    but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as
    described by Taine, “as that which founds all our aspirations on the
    boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which
    their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition,
    and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries,
    popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.” Of course Ethical
    teaching must keep pace.It is well to keep the teaching of the
    Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not
    enough; and must not stand alone.But the knowledge that we get from
    all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps
    just as effectively as other preaching.This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was
    home last, reading George Eliot’s Romola.This work is really a
    great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it.I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and
    inseparable....

            With much love

                C. A. S. HALL.June 10th ’92

    MY DEAR PERCIVAL [at college], Your father has just got home from
    Madison.He says you can go to see the boat-race if you wish to.says perhaps he will go, when are the tickets to be sold, he
    says, on the train that follows the race?He thinks perhaps he would
    like two tickets.He
    thought you had better sell to the Fays the bureau, bedstead,
    chairs, etc.and that you send home the revolving bookcase, the desk
    and hair mattress; and such of the bedclothes as you wish to carry
    to the mountains of course you will keep, but I expect to go up
    there and will look over the bedclothes with you, there may be some
    to send home.Now I suppose you are to keep your room so that our friends can see
    the exercises around the tree on Class-day, I wish Mr.King
    to come and Mr.Will you write to them or shall I
    write?I expect to go up on Wednesday the 22nd so as to get a little rested
    before Class-day.I intend to go over to stay with Mrs.Berrien at
    North Andover between Class-day and Commencement.We have just received an invitation to Carrie Clark’s wedding.An invitation came from Theodore Smith to Father and me, but father
    says he will not go.With love

                  C. A. S. HALL.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             CHAPTER XVII.––––––
                       AUGUSTA LARNED’S TRIBUTE.The following tribute was written by Miss Augusta Larned, and published
in the _Christian Register_ of July 28, 1892:

    There is one master link in the family bond, as there is one
    keystone in the arch.Often we know not its binding power until it
    is taken away.Then the home begins to crumble and fall into
    confusion, and the distinct atoms, like beads from a broken string,
    roll off into distant corners.We turn our thoughts to one who made
    the ideal home, pervaded it, filled its every part like air and
    sunshine coming in at open windows, as unobtrusive as gentle.A
    spiritual attraction drew all to this centre.It was not what she
    said or did; it was what she was that inclined footsteps to her
    door.Those who once felt that subtle, penetrating sweetness felt
    they must return to bask in it again and again.So she never lost
    friends by a loss more pathetic than death.There were no
    dislocations in her life.The good she did seemed to enter the pores of the spirit, and to
    uplift in unknown ways the poor degraded ideal of our lives.The
    secret of her help was not exuberance, but stillness and rest.Ever
    more and more the beautiful secret eluded analysis.It shone out of
    her eyes.It lingered in the lovely smile that irradiated her face,
    and made every touch and tone a benediction.Even the dullest
    perception must have seen that her life was spiritual, based on
    unselfishness and charity.Beside her thoughtfulness and tender care
    all other kinds of self-abnegation seemed poor.She lived in the
    higher range of being.The purity of her face and the clearness of
    her eyes was a rebuke to all low motives.But no word of criticism
    fell from her lips.She was ready to take into her all-embracing
    tenderness those whom others disliked and shunned.Her gentle nature
    found a thousand excuses for their faults.Life had been hard with
    them; and, for this reason, she must be lenient.The good in each
    soul was always present to her perceptions.She reverenced it even
    in its evil admixture as a manifestation of the divine.She shunned the smallest witticism at another’s expense, lest she
    should pain or soil that pure inner mirror of conscience by an
    exaggeration.To the poor
    and despised she never condescended, but poured out her love and
    charity as the woman of Scripture broke the box of precious ointment
    to anoint the Master’s feet.All human beings received their due
    meed of appreciation at her hands.She disregarded the conventional
    limits a false social order has set up, shunning this one and
    honoring that one, because of externals.She was not afraid of
    losing her place in society by knowing the wrong people.She went
    her way with a strange unworldliness through all the prickly hedges,
    daring to be true to her own nature.She drew no arbitrary lines
    between human beings.The rich
    were not welcome for their riches, nor the poor for their poverty;
    but all were welcome for their humanity.Her door was as the door of a shrine because the fair amenities were
    always found within.Hospitality to her was as sacred as the hearth
    altar to the ancients.If she had not money to give the mendicant,
    she gave that something infinitely better,—the touch of human
    kinship.Many came for the dole she had to bestow, the secret
    charity that was not taken from her superfluity, but from her need.Her lowliness of heart was like that of a little child.How could a
    stranger suspect that she was a deep and profound student?Her
    researches had led her to the largest, most liberal faith in God and
    the soul and the spirit of Christ incarnate in humanity.The study
    of nature, to which she was devoted, showed her no irreconcilable
    break between science and religion.She could follow the boldest
    flights of the speculative spirit or face the last analysis of the
    physicist, while she clung to God and the witness of her own being.She aimed at an all-round culture, that one part of her nature might
    not be dwarfed by over-balance and disproportion.But it was the high thinking that went on with the daily doing of
    common duties that made her life so exceptional.A scholar in the
    higher realms of knowledge, a thinker, a seeker after truth, but,
    above all, the mother, the wife, the bread-giver to the household.It was a great privilege to know this woman who aped not others’
    fashions, who had better and higher laws to govern her life, who
    admitted no low motive in her daily walk, who made about her, as by
    a magician’s wand, a sacred circle, free from all gossip, envy,
    strife, and pettiness, who kept all bonds intact by constancy and
    undimmed affection, and has left a memory so sacred few can find
    words to express what she was to her friends.*       *       *       *       *

    But love and self-forgetfulness and tender service wear out the
    silver cord.It was fretted away silently, without complaint, the
    face growing ever more seraphic, at moments almost transparent with
    the shining of an inner light.One trembled to look on that
    spiritual beauty.Surely, the light of a near heaven was there.Silently, without complaint or murmur, she was preparing for the
    great change.Far-away thoughts lay mirrored in her clear, shining
    eyes.She had seen upon the mount the pattern of another life.Still
    no outward change in duty-doing, in tender care for others.Then one
    day she lay down and fell asleep like a little child on its mother’s
    breast, with the inscrutable smile on her lips.She who had been
    “mothering” everybody all her life long was at last gathered gently
    and painlessly into the Everlasting Arms.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                               EPILOGUE.An amber Adirondack river flows
               Down through the hills to blue Ontario;
               Along its banks the staunch rock-maple grows,
               And fields of wheat beneath the drifted snow.The summer sun, as if to quench his flame,
               Dips in the lake, and sinking disappears.Such was the land from which my mother came
               To college, questioning the future years;
               And through the Northern winter’s bitter gloom,
               Gilding the pane, her lamp of knowledge burned.The bride of Science she; and he the groom
               She wed; and they together loved and learned.And like Orion, hunting down the stars,
               He found and gave to her the moons of Mars.------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chalmers is the president of a bank there.Well, I shall
take John Smith in and introduce him to Bob some day.After that,
Bob'll introduce John Smith?All I need is a letter as to my
integrity and respectability, I reckon, so my kinsmen won't suspect me
of designs on their spoons when I ask to board with them.You see, I'm
a quiet, retiring gentleman, and I don't like noisy hotels."With an explosive chuckle the lawyer clapped his knee."Fulton, this is
absolutely the richest thing I ever heard of!I'd give a farm to be a
fly on YOUR wall and see you do it.I'm blest if I don't think I'll go
to Hillerton myself--to see Bob.By George, I will go and see Bob!""Of course," agreed the other serenely.Besides, it will be
the most natural thing in the world--business, you know.In fact, I
should think you really ought to go, in connection with the bequests.""How much are you
going to give them?""Oh, a hundred thousand apiece, I reckon.""That ought to do--for pin money.""Oh, well, I want them to have enough, you know, for it to be a real
test of what they would do with wealth.And it must be cash--no
securities."But how are you going to fix it?What excuse are you going to give for
dropping a hundred thousand into their laps like that?You can't tell
your real purpose, naturally!"That part we'll have to fix up in the letter of instructions.But what are
you going to do afterward--when you've found out what you want to know,
I mean?Won't it be something of a shock, when John Smith turns into
Mr."Y-yes, I've thought of that, and I will confess my ideas are a little
hazy, in spots.Roughly, my plan is this now.There'll be two letters of
instructions: one to open in six months, the other to be opened in,
say, a couple of years, or so.(I want to give myself plenty of time
for my observations, you see.)The second letter will really give you
final instructions as to the settling of my estate--my will.I'll have
to make some sort of one, I suppose.""But, good Heavens, Stanley, you--you--" the lawyer came to a helpless
pause."Oh, that's just for emergency, of course, in case
anything--er--happened.What I really intend is that long before the
second letter of instructions is due to be opened, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton will come back from his South American explorations.He'll then
be in a position to settle his affairs to suit himself, and--er--make a
new will.The millionaire smiled musingly, and stroked his chin again.Well, Smith will have finished collecting Blaisdell data,
of course, and will be off to parts unknown.We don't have to trouble
ourselves with Smith any longer.""Fulton, you're a wizard," laughed the lawyer."But now about the
cousins.You see I've done a little digging already--some years
ago--looking up the Blaisdell family.(By the way, that'll come in fine
now, won't it?)And an occasional letter from Bob has kept me posted as
to deaths and births in the Hillerton Blaisdells.I always meant to
hunt them up some time, they being my nearest kith and kin.Well, with
what I already had, and with what Bob has written me, I know these
facts."He paused, pulled a small notebook from his pocket, and consulted it."There are two sons and a daughter, children of Rufus Blaisdell.Rufus
died years ago, and his widow married a man by the name of Duff.The elder son is Frank Blaisdell.She's about forty-two or three, I
believe, and does dressmaking.James Blaisdell has a son, Fred,
seventeen, and two younger children.Frank Blaisdell has one daughter,
Mellicent.That's the extent of my knowledge, at present."Oh, anything's enough--for your purpose!You'll soon be reading in your morning paper that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the somewhat eccentric multi-millionaire, is about
to start for South America, and that it is hinted he is planning to
finance a gigantic exploring expedition.The accounts of what he's
going to explore will vary all the way from Inca antiquities to the
source of the Amazon.I've done a lot of talking to-day, and a good
deal of cautioning as to secrecy, etc.It ought to bear fruit by
to-morrow, or the day after, at the latest.I'm going to start next
week, and I'm really going EXPLORING, too--though not exactly as they
think.I came in to-day to make a business appointment for to-morrow,
please.A man starting on such a hazardous journey must be prepared,
you understand.I want to leave my affairs in such shape that you will
know exactly what to do--in emergency.The lawyer hesitated, his face an odd mixture of determination and
irresolution.To-morrow at ten--if
they don't shut you up before."Stanley G. Fulton leaped to his feet.At the door he turned back jauntily."And, say, Ned, what'll you bet I don't grow fat and young over this
thing?What'll you bet I don't get so I can eat real meat and 'taters
again?"JOHN SMITH


It was on the first warm evening in early June that Miss Flora
Blaisdell crossed the common and turned down the street that led to her
brother James's home.Its spacious green lawns and
elm-shaded walks were the pride of the town.There was a trellised
band-stand for summer concerts, and a tiny pond that accommodated a few
boats in summer and a limited number of skaters in winter.Perhaps,
most important of all, the common divided the plebeian East Side from
the more pretentious West.James Blaisdell lived on the West Side.His
wife said that everybody did who WAS anybody.They had lately moved
there, and were, indeed, barely settled.Her home was a shabby little rented
cottage on the East Side.She was a thin-faced little woman with an
anxious frown and near-sighted, peering eyes that seemed always to be
looking for wrinkles.She peered now at the houses as she passed slowly
down the street.She had been only twice to her brother's new home, and
she was not sure that she would recognize it, in spite of the fact that
the street was still alight with the last rays of the setting sun.Suddenly across her worried face flashed a relieved smile."Well, if you ain't all here out on the piazza!"she exclaimed,
turning, in at the walk leading up to one of the ornate little houses."Oh, yes, it's grand, all right," nodded the tired-looking man in the
big chair, removing his feet from the railing.He was in his
shirt-sleeves, and was smoking a pipe.The droop of his thin mustache
matched the droop of his thin shoulders--and both indefinably but
unmistakably spelled disillusion and discouragement."It's grand, but I
think it's too grand--for us.However, daughter says the best is none
too good--in Hillerton.Bessie, the pretty, sixteen-year-old daughter of the family, only
shrugged her shoulders a little petulantly.It was Harriet, the wife,
who spoke--a large, florid woman with a short upper lip, and a
bewilderment of bepuffed light hair.She was already on her feet,
pushing a chair toward her sister-in-law."Of course it isn't too grand, Jim, and you know it.There aren't any
really nice houses in Hillerton except the Pennocks' and the old
Gaylord place.The little
dressmaker began to fan herself with the hat she had taken off."My,
'tis fur over here, ain't it?Not much like 'twas when you lived right
'round the corner from me!And I had to put on a hat and gloves, too.Someway, I thought I ought to--over here."Condescendingly the bepuffed head threw an approving nod in her
direction.The East Side is different from the West Side, and
no mistake.And what will do there won't do here at all, of course.""How about father's shirt-sleeves?"It was a scornful gibe from Bessie
in the hammock."I don't notice any of the rest of the men around here
sitting out like that.""You know very well I'm not to
blame for what your father wears.I've tried hard enough, I'm sure!""Well, well, Hattie," sighed the man, with a gesture of abandonment."I
supposed I still had the rights of a freeborn American citizen in my
own home; but it seems I haven't."Resignedly he got to his feet and
went into the house.When he returned a moment later he was wearing his
coat.Benny, perched precariously on the veranda railing, gave a sudden
indignant snort.Benny was eight, the youngest of the family."Well, I don't think I like it here, anyhow," he chafed."I'd rather go
back an' live where we did.It hasn't
been anything but 'Here, Benny, you mustn't do that over here, you
mustn't do that over here!'I'm going home an' live
with Aunt Flora.Of course you can," beamed his aunt."But you won't
want to, I'm sure.Why, Benny, I think it's perfectly lovely here.""Indeed I do, Benny," corrected his father hastily."It's very nice
indeed here, of course.But I don't think we can afford it.We had to
squeeze every penny before, and how we're going to meet this rent I
don't know.""You'll earn it, just being here--more business," asserted his wife
firmly."Anyhow, we've just got to be here, Jim!We owe it to ourselves
and our family."He's over to Gussie Pennock's, playing tennis," interposed Bessie,
with a pout."The mean old thing wouldn't ask me!""But you ain't old enough, my dear," soothed her aunt."Wait; your turn
will come by and by.""Yes, that's exactly it," triumphed the mother."Her turn WILL come--if
we live here.Do you suppose Fred would have got an invitation to
Gussie Pennock's if we'd still been living on the East Side?Pennock's worth fifty thousand, if he's worth a
dollar!"But, Hattie, money isn't everything, dear," remonstrated her husband
gently."We had friends, and good friends, before.""Yes; but you wait and see what kind of friends we have now!""But we can't keep up with such people, dear, on our income; and--"

"Ma, here's a man.It was a husky whisper
from Benny.Bessie Blaisdell and the little
dressmaker cocked their heads interestedly.Blaisdell rose to her
feet and advanced toward the steps to meet the man coming up the walk.He was a tall, rather slender man, with a close-cropped, sandy beard,
and an air of diffidence and apology.As he took off his hat and came
nearer, it was seen that his eyes were blue and friendly, and that his
hair was reddish-brown, and rather scanty on top of his head.James Blaisdell," he murmured
hesitatingly.Something in the stranger's deferential manner sent a warm glow of
importance to the woman's heart.Blaisdell was suddenly reminded
that she was Mrs.James D. Blaisdell of the West Side.Blaisdell," she replied a bit pompously."What can we do for
you, my good man?"She had never
called a person "my good man" before.The man on the steps coughed slightly behind his hand--a sudden
spasmodic little cough.Then very gravely he reached into his pocket
and produced a letter.Robert Chalmers--a note to your husband," he bowed,
presenting the letter.A look of gratified surprise came into the woman's face.Her husband, already on his feet, whisked the sheet of paper from the
unsealed envelope, and adjusted his glasses.A moment later he held out
a cordial hand to the stranger.I'm glad to see any friend of Bob
Chalmers'.My wife and children, and my sister,
Miss Blaisdell.(Glancing at the
open note in his hand.)Chalmers, of the First
National."Still with that deference
so delightfully heart-warming, the newcomer bowed low to the ladies,
and made his way to the offered chair."I will explain at once my
business," he said then.It was an eager question from Benny on the veranda
railing."Pa isn't anything, but ma's a Congregationalist."protested a duet of feminine voices softly; but the
stranger, apparently ignoring the interruption, continued speaking."I am gathering material for a book on the Blaisdell family."James Blaisdell, with cordial
interest."It is my purpose to remain some time in your
town.I am told there are valuable records here, and an old
burying-ground of particular interest in this connection.The
neighboring towns, too, have much Blaisdell data, I understand.As I
said, I am intending to make this place my headquarters, and I am
looking for an attractive boarding-place.Chalmers was good enough
to refer me to you.""To us--for a BOARDING-place!"James D. Blaisdell's countenance as she said the words."Well, I'm sure
I don't see why he should."But, Hattie, we could," interposed her husband eagerly."There's that
big front room that we don't need a bit.And it would help a lot if--"
At the wrathful warning in his wife's eyes he fell back silenced."I said that we didn't keep boarders," reiterated the lady distinctly."Furthermore, we do need the room ourselves.""Yes, yes, of course; I understand," broke in Mr.Smith, as if in hasty
conciliation.Chalmers meant that perhaps one of you"--he
glanced uncertainly at the anxious-eyed little woman at his
left--"might--er--accommodate me.Perhaps you, now--" He turned his
eyes full upon Miss Flora Blaisdell, and waited.Why, I live all alone--that is, I mean, I couldn't,
you know," she stammered confusedly."I dressmake, and I don't get any
sort of meals--not fit for a man, I mean.Just women's things--tea,
toast, and riz biscuit.I'm so fond of riz biscuit!But, of course,
you--" She came to an expressive pause."Oh, I could stand the biscuit, so long as they're not health biscuit,"
laughed Mr."You see, I've been living on those and hot
water quite long enough as it is.""Oh, ain't your health good, sir?"The little dressmaker's face wore
the deepest concern."Well, it's better than it was, thank you.I think I can promise to be
a good boarder, all right.""Why don't you go to a hotel?"James D. Blaisdell still spoke with
a slightly injured air."Oh, indeed, that would not do at all--for my purpose," he murmured."I
wish to be very quiet.I fear I should find it quite disturbing--the
noise and confusion of a public place like that.Besides, for my work,
it seemed eminently fitting, as well as remarkably convenient, if I
could make my home with one of the Blaisdell family."With a sudden exclamation the little dressmaker sat erect."Say, Harriet, how funny we never thought!He's just the one for poor
Maggie!She lives--"

"Your SISTER!"Smith's face had come a look of startled
surprise--a look almost of terror."But there weren't but three--that
is, I thought--I understood from Mr.Chalmers that there were but three
Blaisdells, two brothers, and one sister--you, yourself.""Oh, poor Maggie ain't a Blaisdell," explained the little dressmaker,
with a smile."She's just Maggie Duff, father Duff's daughter by his
first wife, you know.He married our mother years ago, when we children
were little, so we were brought up with Maggie, and always called her
sister; though, of course, she really ain't any relation to us at all."He appeared to be settling something in his mind."She
isn't a Blaisdell, then.""No, but she's so near like one, and she's a splendid cook, and---"

"Well, I shan't send him to Maggie," cut in Mrs.James D. Blaisdell
with emphasis."Poor Maggie's got quite enough on her hands, as it is,
with that father of hers.Besides, she isn't a Blaisdell at all.""And she couldn't come and cook and take care of us near so much,
either, could she," plunged in Benny, "if she took this man ter feed?""That will do, Benny," admonished his mother, with nettled dignity."You forget that children should be seen and not heard."But, please, can't I be heard just a minute for this?Why don't
ye send the man ter Uncle Frank an' Aunt Jane?cried Miss Flora Blaisdell."I wouldn't wonder a mite
if they did.""Yes, I was thinking of them," nodded her sister-in-law."And they're
always glad of a little help,--especially Jane."Only the heightened color in his wife's cheeks showed that she had
heard--and understood."Here, Benny," she directed, "go and show the gentleman where Uncle
Frank lives."With a spring the boy leaped to the lawn and pranced to
the sidewalk, dancing there on his toes.Blaisdell," he said, "and you, ladies.I shall hope
to see you again soon.I am sure you can help me, if you will, in my
work.We shall be glad to see you," promised his
host."Come any time, and ask all the questions you want to.""And we shall be so interested," fluttered Miss Flora."I've always
wanted to know about father's folks.And are you a Blaisdell, too?"Smith coughed again twice behind
his hand."Er--ah--oh, yes, I may say that I am.Through my mother I am descended
from the original immigrant, Ebenezer Blaisdell."James Blaisdell spoke the word as if her tongue
were a pair of tongs that had picked up a noxious viper."Yes, but not exactly as we commonly regard the term nowadays," smiled
Mr.Ebenezer Blaisdell was a man of means and distinction.He was the founder of the family in this country.murmured the little dressmaker, as the visitor
descended the steps.John Smith to
the assembled group on the veranda."And now, young man, I'm at your
service," he smiled, as he joined Benny, still prancing on the sidewalk."Now he's what I call a real nice pleasant-spoken gentleman," avowed
Miss Flora, when she thought speech was safe."I do hope Jane'll take
him.""Oh, yes, he's well enough," condescended Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell, with a
yawn."Hattie, why wouldn't you take him in?""Just
think how the pay would help!And it wouldn't be a bit of work, hardly,
for you.Certainly it would be a lot easier than the way we are doing."Do you suppose I got over here on the West Side to
open a boarding-house?"Perhaps if you'd worry a little more, I wouldn't worry so much,"
sighed the man deeply."Well, mercy me, I must be going," interposed the little dressmaker,
springing to her feet with a nervous glance at her brother and his
wife."I'm forgetting it ain't so near as it used to be.Come again," called the three on the veranda.Then the door closed behind them, as they entered the house.Meanwhile, walking across the common, Benny was entertaining Mr."Yep, they'll take ye, I bet ye--Aunt Jane an' Uncle Frank will!""Well, that's good, I'm sure."Why, Aunt Jane'll just tumble over
herself ter get ye, if ye just mention first what yer'll PAY.She'll
begin ter reckon up right away then what she'll save.An' in a minute
she'll say, 'Yes, I'll take ye.'"Smith's voice was palpable even to
eight-year-old Benny."Oh, you don't need ter worry," he hastened to explain."She won't
starve ye; only she won't let ye waste anythin'.You'll have ter eat
all the crusts to yer pie, and finish 'taters before you can get any
puddin', an' all that, ye know.Ye see, she's great on savin'--Aunt
Jane is.She says waste is a sinful extravagance before the Lord.""But are you sure, my
boy, that you ought to talk--just like this, about your aunt?""Why, that's all right, Mr.Ev'rybody in town knows Aunt Jane.Why, Ma says folks say she'd save ter-day for ter-morrer, if she could.But she couldn't do that, could she?But you
wait till you see Aunt Jane.""Well, ye won't have ter wait long, Mr.She lives over the groc'ry store, ter save rent, ye know.An' here we are," he finished, banging open a door and
leading the way up a flight of ill-lighted stairs.CHAPTER III

THE SMALL BOY AT THE KEYHOLE


At the top of the stairs Benny tried to open the door, but as it did
not give at his pressure, he knocked lustily, and called "Aunt Jane,
Aunt Jane!"Smith, his finger almost on a small
push-button near him."Yep, but it don't go now.Uncle Frank wanted it fixed, but Aunt Jane
said no; knockin' was just as good, an' 'twas lots cheaper, 'cause
'twould save mendin', and didn't use any 'lectricity.But Uncle Frank
says---"

The door opened abruptly, and Benny interrupted himself to give eager
greeting.Smith saw a tall, angular woman with graying
dark hair and high cheek bones.Her eyes were keen and just now
somewhat sternly inquiring, as they were bent upon himself.Perceiving that Benny considered his mission as master of ceremonies at
an end, Mr."I came from your husband's brother, madam.He thought
perhaps you had a room that I could have."Her eyes grew still more coldly disapproving.He thought--that is, THEY thought that perhaps--you
would be so kind."I
never have--but that isn't saying I couldn't, of course.As she finished speaking she stepped to the low-burning gas
jet and turned it carefully to give a little more light down the narrow
hallway.Benny had already reached the door at the end of the hall.The woman
began to tug at her apron strings."I hope you'll excuse my gingham apron, Mr.--er--Smith.Well, as I was saying, I hope
you'll excuse this apron."Her fingers were fumbling with the knot at
the back."I take it off, mostly, when the bell rings, evenings or
afternoons; but I heard Benny, and I didn't suppose 't was anybody but
him.With a jerk she switched off the dark blue
apron, hung it over her arm, and smoothed down the spotless white apron
which had been beneath the blue.The next instant she hurried after
Benny with a warning cry.Oh, Benny, you're
always in such a hurry!"Benny, with a cheery "Come on!"had already banged open the door before
him, and was reaching for the gas burner.A moment later the feeble spark above had become a flaring sputter of
flame."There, child, what did I tell you?"Blaisdell
reduced the flaring light to a moderate flame, and motioned Mr.Before she seated herself, however, she went back into the
hall to lower the gas there.During her momentary absence the man, Smith, looked about him, and as
he looked he pulled at his collar.He felt suddenly a choking,
suffocating sensation.He still had the curious feeling of trying to
catch his breath when the woman came back and took the chair facing
him.In a moment he knew why he felt so suffocated--it was because that
nowhere could he see an object that was not wholly or partially covered
with some other object, or that was not serving as a cover itself.The floor bore innumerable small rugs, one before each chair, each
door, and the fireplace.The chairs themselves, and the sofa, were
covered with gray linen slips, which, in turn, were protected by
numerous squares of lace and worsted of generous size.The green silk
spread on the piano was nearly hidden beneath a linen cover, and the
table showed a succession of layers of silk, worsted, and linen, topped
by crocheted mats, on which rested several books with paper-enveloped
covers.The chandelier, mirror, and picture frames gleamed dully from
behind the mesh of pink mosquito netting.Even through the doorway into
the hall might be seen the long, red-bordered white linen path that
carried protection to the carpet beneath.(With a start the man pulled himself
together to listen to what the woman was saying.)"I think it's a
foolish extravagance, when kerosene is so good and so cheap; but my
husband will have it, and Mellicent, too, in spite of anything I
say--Mellicent's my daughter.I tell 'em if we were rich, it would be
different, of course.But this is neither here nor there, nor what you
came to talk about!Now just what is it that you want, sir?""I want to board here, if I may.""A year--two years, perhaps, if we are mutually satisfied."Before he could catch his breath to answer
Benny had jumped into the breach."He sounds something like a Congregationalist, only he ain't that, Aunt
Jane, and he ain't after money for missionaries, either."Jane Blaisdell smiled at Benny indulgently."You know, Benny, very well, that nothing would suit Aunt Jane better
than to give money to all the missionaries in the world, if she only
had it to give!""You're
working for some church, then, I take it.""I am a genealogist, madam, in a small way.I am collecting data for a
book on the Blaisdell family."The look of cold disapproval
came back to her eyes.WE couldn't take the book,
I'm sure."That would not be necessary, madam, I assure you," murmured Mr."But how do you get money to live on?I mean, how am I to know that
I'll get my pay?""Excuse me, but that kind of business
doesn't sound very good-paying; and, you see, I don't know you.And in
these days--" An expressive pause finished her sentence.I had a letter of
introduction to your brother from Mr.I think he will
vouch for me."Oh, that's all right, then.But that isn't saying how MUCH you'll pay.Now, I think--"

There came a sharp knock at the outer door.The eager Benny jumped to
his feet, but his aunt shook her head and went to the door herself.There was a murmur of voices, then a young man entered the hall and sat
down in the chair near the hatrack.Blaisdell returned her
eyes were very bright."If you'll just excuse me a minute," she apologized to Mr.Smith, as
she swept by him and opened a door across the room, nearly closing it
behind her.Distinctly then, from beyond the imperfectly closed door, came to the
ears of Benny and Mr.Blaisdell's most
excited accents:--"Mellicent, it's Carl Pennock.He wants you to go
auto-riding with him down to the Lake with Katie Moore and that crowd."Smith did not hear, for a nearer, yet more excited,
voice demanded attention.Won't my sister
Bess be mad?She thinks Carl Pennock's the cutest thing going.and an expressive glance toward the hall, Mr.Smith tried to stop further revelations; but Benny was not to be
silenced."They're rich--awful rich--the Pennocks are," he confided still more
huskily."An' there's a girl--Gussie.He's seventeen; an' Bess is mad 'cause she isn't
seventeen, too, so she can go an' play tennis same as Fred does.She'll
be madder 'n ever now, if Mell goes auto-riding with Carl, an'--"

"Sh-h!"Smith's voice and gesture this time that
Benny fell back subdued.At once then became distinctly audible again the voices from the other
room.Smith, forced to hear in spite of himself, had the air of one
who finds he has abandoned the frying pan for the fire."No, dear, it's quite out of the question," came from beyond the door,
in Mrs."I can't let you wear your pink.You will
wear the blue or stay at home."But, mother, dear, it's all out of date," wailed a young girl's voice.It's perfectly whole and neat, and you must save
the pink for best.""But I'm always saving things for best, mother, and I never wear my
best.I never wear a thing when it's in style!By the time you let me
wear the pink I shan't want to wear it.Sleeves'll be small then--you
see if they aren't--I shall be wearing big ones.I want to wear big
ones now, when other girls do."Mellicent, why will you tease me like this, when you know it will do
no good?--when you know I can't let you do it?Don't you think I want
you to be as well-dressed as anybody, if we could afford it?You must wear the blue or stay at home.There was a pause, then there came an inarticulate word and a choking
half-sob.The pink spots in her cheeks had deepened.She shut the door firmly,
then hurried through the room to the hall beyond.Another minute and
she was back in her chair."I'm ready now to talk business, Mr.She stated plainly what she expected to do for
her boarder, and what she expected her boarder would do for her.She
enlarged upon the advantages and minimized the discomforts, with the
aid of a word now and then from the eager and interested Benny.Smith, on his part, had little to say.That that little was most
satisfactory, however, was very evident; for Mrs.Blaisdell was soon
quite glowing with pride and pleasure.He
was plainly ill at ease, and, at times, slightly abstracted.His eyes
frequently sought the door which Mrs.Blaisdell had closed so firmly a
short time before.They were still turned in that direction when
suddenly the door opened and a young girl appeared.She was a slim little girl with long-lashed, starlike eyes and a
wild-rose flush in her cheeks.Beneath her trim hat her light brown
hair waved softly over her ears, glinting into gold where the light
struck it.She looked excited and pleased, yet not quite happy.She
wore a blue dress, plainly made.Be in before ten, dear," cautioned Mrs."And Mellicent, just a minute, dear.He's coming here to live--to board, you know.Smith, already on his feet, bowed and murmured a conventional
something.From the starlike eyes he received a fleeting glance that
made him suddenly conscious of his fifty years and the bald spot on the
top of his head.Then the girl was gone, and her mother was speaking
again."She's going auto-riding--Mellicent is--with a young man, Carl
Pennock--one of the nicest in town.They're going down to the Lake for cake and ice cream, and they're all
nice young people, else I shouldn't let her go, of course.She's
eighteen, for all she's so small.She favors my mother in looks, but
she's got the Blaisdell nose, though.Oh, and 'twas the Blaisdells you
said you were writing a book about, wasn't it?You don't mean OUR
Blaisdells, right here in Hillerton?""I mean all Blaisdells, wherever I find them," smiled Mr.Now that the matter
of board had been satisfactorily settled, Mrs.Blaisdell apparently
dared to show some interest in the book.My, how pleased Hattie'll be--my sister-in-law, Jim's
wife.She just loves to see her name in print--parties, and club
banquets, and where she pours, you know.But maybe you don't take
women, too.""Oh, yes, if they are Blaisdells, or have married Blaisdells."That's where we'd come in, then, isn't it?And
Frank, my husband, he'll like it, too,--if you tell about the grocery
store.And of course you would, if you told about him.You'd have
to--'cause that's all there is to tell.He thinks that's about all
there is in the world, anyway,--that grocery store.And 'tis a good
store, if I do say it.And there's his sister, Flora; and Maggie--But,
there!She won't be in it, will she, after all?She isn't
a Blaisdell, and she didn't marry one."She'll just laugh
and say it doesn't matter; and then Grandpa Duff'll ask for his drops
or his glasses, or something, and she'll forget all about it."Yes, I know; but--Poor Maggie!Blaisdell
sighed and looked thoughtful."But Maggie KNOWS a lot about the
Blaisdells," she added, brightening; "so she could tell you lots of
things--about when they were little, and all that."But--that isn't--er--" Mr."And, really, for that matter, she knows about us NOW, too, better than
'most anybody else.Hattie's always sending for her, and Flora, too, if
they're sick, or anything.Sometimes I think they actually
impose upon her.And she's such a good soul, too!I declare, I never
see her but I wish I could do something for her.But, of course, with
my means--But, there!Frank says I
never do know when to stop, when I get started on something; and of
course you didn't come here to talk about poor Maggie.When is it you want to start in--to board, I mean?""And now we must be going--Benny and I. I'm at the Holland House.Blaisdell, I'll send up my trunks to-morrow
morning.And now good-night--and thank you."The woman, too, came to her feet, but her face
was surprised."Why, you haven't even seen your room yet!How do you
know you'll like it?"There was a quizzical lift to his
eyebrows.Well--er--perhaps I will just take a look at--the room, though I'm not
worrying any, I assure you.I've no doubt it will be quite right, quite
right," he finished, as he followed Mrs.Blaisdell to a door halfway
down the narrow hall.Five minutes later, once more on the street, he was walking home with
Benny.It was Benny who broke the long silence that had immediately
fallen between them.Smith, I'll bet ye YOU'll never be rich!"I'll never be--What do you mean, boy?""'Cause you paid Aunt Jane what she asked the very first time.Why,
Aunt Jane never expects ter get what she asks, pa says.She sells him
groceries in the store, sometimes, when Uncle Frank's away, ye know.Pa
says what she asks first is for practice--just ter get her hand in; an'
she expects ter get beat down.But you paid it, right off the bat.Didn't ye see how tickled Aunt Jane was, after she'd got over bein'
surprised?""Why--er--really, Benny," murmured Mr."Oh, yes, sir, you could have saved a lot every week, if ye hadn't bit
so quick.An' that's why I say you won't ever get rich.Savin''s what
does it, ye know--gets folks rich.She says a penny
saved's good as two earned, an' better than four spent.""That does look as
if there wasn't much chance for me, doesn't it?"Benny spoke soberly, and with evident sympathy.He spoke
again, after a moment, but Mr.Smith was, indeed, not a little abstracted all the way to Benny's home,
though his good-night was very cheerful at parting.Benny would have
been surprised, indeed, had he known that Mr.Smith was thinking, not
about his foolishly extravagant agreement for board, but about a pair
of starry eyes with wistful lights in them, and a blue dress, plainly
made.John Smith wrote the following letter to
Edward D. Norton, Esq., Chicago:

MY DEAR NED,--Well, I'm here.I've been here exactly six hours, and
already I'm in possession of not a little Blaisdell data for
my--er--book.James, their daughter, Bessie, and
their son, Benny.Benny, by the way, is a gushing geyser of current
Blaisdell data which, I foresee, I shall find interesting, but
embarrassing, perhaps, at times.I've also seen Miss Flora, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and her daughter, Mellicent.There's a "Poor Maggie" whom I haven't seen.But she isn't a Blaisdell.She's a Duff, daughter of the man who married Rufus Blaisdell's widow,
some thirty years or more ago.As I said, I haven't seen her yet, but
she, too, according to Mrs.Frank Blaisdell, must be a gushing geyser
of Blaisdell data, so I probably soon shall see her.Why she's "poor" I
don't know.As for the Blaisdell data already in my possession--I've no comment to
make.Really, Ned, to tell the truth, I'm not sure I'm going to relish
this job, after all.In spite of a perfectly clear conscience, and the
virtuous realization that I'm here to bring nothing worse than a
hundred thousand dollars apiece with the possible addition of a few
millions on their devoted heads--in spite of all this, I yet have an
uncomfortable feeling that I'm a small boy listening at the keyhole.However, I'm committed to the thing now, so I'll stuff it out, I
suppose,--though I'm not sure, after all, that I wouldn't chuck the
whole thing if it wasn't that I wanted to see how Mellicent will enjoy
her pink dresses.How many pink dresses will a hundred thousand dollars
buy, anyway,--I mean PRETTY pink dresses, all fixed up with frills and
furbelows?As ever yours,

STAN--er--JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IV

IN SEARCH OF SOME DATES


Very promptly the next morning Mr.John Smith and his two trunks
appeared at the door of his new boarding-place.Jane Blaisdell
welcomed him cordially.She wore a high-necked, long-sleeved gingham
apron this time, which she neither removed nor apologized for--unless
her cheerful "You see, mornings you'll find me in working trim, Mr.Mellicent, her slender young self enveloped in a similar apron, was
dusting his room as he entered it.She nodded absently, with a casual
"Good-morning, Mr.Even the
placing of the two big trunks, which the shuffling men brought in, won
from her only a listless glance or two.Then, without speaking again,
she left the room, as her mother entered it.Blaisdell looked about her complacently."With this
couch-bed with its red cover and cushions, and all the dressing things
moved to the little room in there, it looks like a real sitting-room in
here, doesn't it?""And you had 'em take the trunks in there, too.That's good," she
nodded, crossing to the door of the small dressing-room beyond.Well, I hope you'll be real happy with us, Mr.And you needn't be a mite afraid of
hurting anything.I've covered everything with mats and tidies and
spreads."A keen listener would have noticed an odd something in
Mr."Yes, I always do--to save wearing and soiling, you know.Of course, if
we had money to buy new all the time, it would be different.And that's what I tell Mellicent when she complains of so many
things to dust and brush.Dinner's at twelve o'clock, and supper is at six--except in the winter.We have it earlier then, so's we can go to bed earlier.I do like the long days, don't you?Well,
I'll be off now, and let you unpack.As I said before, make yourself
perfectly at home, perfectly at home."Smith drew a long breath and looked about him.It was a
pleasant room, in spite of its cluttered appearance.There was an
old-fashioned desk for his papers, and the chairs looked roomy and
comfortable.The little dressing-room carried many conveniences, and
the windows of both rooms looked out upon the green of the common."Oh, well, I don't know.This might be lots worse--in spite of the
tidies!"John Smith, as he singled out the keys of his
trunks.He was a
portly man with rather thick gray hair and "mutton-chop" gray whiskers.He ate very fast, and a great deal, yet he still found time to talk
interestedly with his new boarder.He was plainly a man of decided opinions--opinions which he did not
hesitate to express, and which he emphasized with resounding thumps of
his fists on the table.Smith, taken
utterly by surprise, was guilty of a visible start.After that he
learned to accept them with the serenity evinced by the rest of the
family.Smith knew (if he could remember them)
the current market prices of beans, corn, potatoes, sugar, and flour;
and he knew (again if he could remember) why some of these commodities
were higher, and some lower, than they had been the week before.That stocks and bonds fluctuated,
he was well aware.That "wheat" could be cornered, he realized.But of
the ups and downs of corn and beans as seen by the retail grocer he
knew very little.That is, he had known very little until after that
dinner with Mr.Smith began systematically to gather
material for his Blaisdell book.He would first visit by turns all the
Hillerton Blaisdells, he decided; then, when he had exhausted their
resources, he would, of course, turn to the town records and cemeteries
of Hillerton and the neighboring villages.Armed with a pencil and a very businesslike looking notebook,
therefore, he started at two o'clock for the home of James Blaisdell.Blaisdell's kind permission to come and ask all the
questions he liked, he deemed it fitting to begin there.He had no trouble in finding the house, but there was no one in sight
this time, as he ascended the steps.The house, indeed, seemed
strangely quiet.He was just about to ring the bell when around the
corner of the veranda came a hurried step and a warning voice."Oh, please, don't ring the bell!Isn't it something that I
can do for you?"He thought at first, from the trim, slender
figure, and the waving hair above the gracefully poised head, that he
was confronting a young woman.Then he saw the silver threads at the
temples, and the fine lines about the eyes.James Blaisdell," he answered,
lifting his hat.She smiled brightly, then
went on before he could reply.I fancy I should be edified to hear
it--that description."Then, a bit roguishly, she demanded:--"Should you
like to hear it--really?"I've already collected a few samples of Benny's
descriptive powers."She motioned him
to a chair, and dropped easily into one herself."Benny said you were
tall and not fat; that you had a wreath of light hair 'round a bald
spot, and whiskers that were clipped as even as Mr.Pennock's hedge;
and that your lips, without speaking, said, 'Run away, little boy,' but
that your eyes said, 'Come here.'"So I judge, since you recognized me without any difficulty," rejoined
Mr.You see you have the advantage of
me."Oh, I'm just here to help out.Blaisdell is ill upstairs--one of
her headaches.That is why I asked you not to ring.She gets so nervous
when the bell rings.She thinks it's callers, and that she won't be
ready to receive them; and she hurries up and begins to dress.So I
asked you not to ring.""Oh, for the book, of course.Oh, yes, I have heard about that, too."Blaisdell will soon
be here.He's coming early so I can go home."And you are--"

"Miss Duff."You don't mean--'Poor Maggie'!"(Not until the words were out did Mr."Er--ah--that is--" He
stumbled miserably, and she came to his rescue."Oh, yes, I'm--'Poor Maggie.'"There was an odd something in her
expressive face that Mr.He was groping for
something--anything to say, when suddenly there was a sound behind
them, and the little woman at his side sprang to her feet."Oh, Hattie, you came down!"James Blaisdell
opened the screen door and stepped out on to the veranda.Blaisdell advanced and held out her hand.She looked pale, and her hair
hung a bit untidily about one ear below a somewhat twisted pyramid of
puffs.Her dress, though manifestly an expensive one, showed haste in
its fastenings."Yes, I heard voices, and I thought some one had
come--a caller."I'm glad--if you're better," smiled Miss Maggie."Then I'll go, if you
don't mind.Smith has come to ask you some questions, Hattie.With another cheery smile and a nod to Mr.Smith, she
disappeared into the house.Smith saw her hurrying
down a side path to the street.Blaisdell sank languidly into
a chair."About the Blaisdell family--yes.But perhaps another day, when you are
feeling better, Mrs."I can answer to-day as
well as any time--though I'm not sure I can tell you very much, ever.I
think it's fine you are making the book, though.Some way it gives a
family such a standing, to be written up like that.And the Blaisdells are really a very nice family--one of the oldest in
Hillerton, though, of course, they haven't much money.""I ought to find a good deal of material here, then, if they have lived
here so long."Of course I can tell you
about my own family.You
knew that, didn't you?His
picture was in it a year ago last June.There was a write-up on
Hillerton.I was in it, too, though there wasn't much about me.But
I've got other clippings with more, if you'd like to see them--where
I've poured, and been hostess, and all that, you know."Blaisdell, your husband's father's name was Rufus, I
believe.What was his mother's maiden name, please?"Our little girl is named
for her--Bessie, you know--you saw her last night.Jim wanted to, so I
let him.It's a pretty name--Elizabeth--still, it sounds a little
old-fashioned now, don't you think?Of course we are anxious to have
everything just right for our daughter.A young lady soon coming out,
so,--you can't be too particular.That's one reason why I wanted to get
over here--on the West Side, I mean.Everybody who is anybody lives on
the West Side in Hillerton.And your mother Blaisdell's surname?"Smith's
pencil was poised over the open notebook.But,
dear me, I don't know.I suppose Jim will, or Flora, or maybe
Frank--though I don't believe HE will, unless her folks kept groceries.Did you ever see anybody that didn't know anything but groceries like
Frank Blaisdell?"The lady sighed and shrugged her somewhat heavy
shoulders with an expressive glance."Oh, well, it's good--to be interested in one's business, you know."murmured the lady, with another shrug.Rufus Blaisdell's surname?"But Jim--Oh, I'll tell you who will know," she broke off
interestedly; "and that's Maggie Duff.You saw her here a few minutes
ago, you know.Father Duff's got all of Mother Blaisdell's papers and
diaries.Oh, Maggie can tell you a lot of things.Benny
says if we want ANYTHING we ask Aunt Maggie, and I don't know but he's
right.And here I am, sending you to her, so soon!""I don't see but what I shall have
to interview Miss Maggie, and Miss Flora.Is there nothing more, then,
that you can tell me?""Well, there's Fred, my son.He's at the head of his class, and he's going to college and
be a lawyer.And that's another reason why I wanted to come over to
this side--on Fred's account.I want him to meet the right sort of
people.We think we're going to have Fred a
big man some day."Smith's pencil still poised above an
almost entirely blank page.He'll be eighteen the tenth of next month.""And Miss Bessie, and Benny?"She wants to come
out then, but I think I shall wait--a little, she's so very young;
though Gussie Pennock's out, and she's only seventeen, and the Pennocks
are some of our very best people.They're the richest folks in town,
you know.""He's eight--or rather nine, next Tuesday.Smith, don't
you want ANYTHING but dates?They're tiresome things, I think,--make
one feel so old, you know, and it shows up how many years you've been
married.Well, you miss a lot, of course,--home and wife and
children.You aren't tied down, and you
don't have so much to worry about.Is your mother living, or your
father?"Smith stirred a little uneasily,
and adjusted his book.Blaisdell, you can give me
your own maiden name.""Oh, yes, I can give you that!"She laughed and bridled
self-consciously."But you needn't ask when I was born, for I shan't
tell you, if you do.And the Snows were just as good as the Blaisdells,
if I do say it.There were a lot that wanted me--oh, I was pretty THEN,
Mr.She laughed, and bridled again self-consciously.He was handsome then, very--big dark eyes and dark hair, and
so dreamy and poetical-looking; and there wasn't a girl that hadn't set
her cap for him.And he's been a good husband to me.To be sure, he
isn't quite so ambitious as he might be, perhaps._I_ always did
believe in being somebody, and getting somewhere.But
Jim--he's always for hanging back and saying how much it'll cost.Ten
to one he doesn't end up by saying we can't afford it.He's like
Jane,--Frank's wife, where you board, you know,--only Jane's worse than
Jim ever thought of being.She won't spend even what she's got.If
she's got ten dollars, she won't spend but five cents, if she can help
it.Now, I believe in taking some comfort as you go along.But
Jane--greatest saver I ever did see.Smith, that
she doesn't try to save feeding you at all!"Smith smiled cheerily, snapped his book shut
and got to his feet."Oh, won't you wait for Mr.He can tell you more, I'm sure."At his office, some time, I'll see Mr."But I thank you
very much, Mrs.Blaisdell," he bowed in farewell.CHAPTER V

IN MISS FLORA'S ALBUM


It was the next afternoon that Mr.Smith inquired his way to the home
of Miss Flora Blaisdell.He found it to be a shabby little cottage on a
side street.Miss Flora herself answered his knock, peering at him
anxiously with her near-sighted eyes."Good-afternoon, Miss Blaisdell," he began with a deferential bow."I
am wondering if you could tell me something of your father's family."Miss Flora, plainly pleased, but flustered, stepped back for him to
enter.I'm sure I'm glad to tell you
anything I know," she beamed, ushering him into the unmistakably
little-used "front room.""But you really ought to go to Maggie.I can
tell you some things, but Maggie's got the Bible.Mother had it, you
know, and it's all among her things.And of course we had to let it
stay, as long as Father Duff lives.Poor Maggie--she tried to get 'em for us; but, mercy!I've got pictures of a lot of them,
and most of them I know quite a lot about."As she spoke she nicked up from the table a big red plush photograph
album.Seating herself at his side she opened it, and began to tell him
of the pictures, one by one.She did, indeed, know "quite a lot" of most of them.Tintypes,
portraying stiffly held hands and staring eyes, ghostly reproductions
of daguerreotypes of stern-lipped men and women, in old-time stock and
kerchief; photographs of stilted family groups after the
"he-is-mine-and-I-am-his" variety; snap-shots of adorable babies with
blurred thumbs and noses--never had Mr.Busily, from time to time, he jotted down a name
or date.Then, suddenly, as she turned a page, he gave an involuntary
start.He was looking at a pictured face, evidently cut from a magazine."Why, what--who--" he stammered.Miss Flora's
hands fluttered over the page a little importantly, adjusting a corner
of the print.I can't tell you just how, only I know he
is.That's why I've always been so
interested in him, and read everything I could--in the papers and
magazines, you know."John Smith's voice had become a little uncertain.Miss Flora's eyes were musingly
fixed on the picture before her--which was well, perhaps: Mr.John
Smith's face was a study just then."Er--n-no, he isn't.""But he's turribly rich, I s'pose.I wonder how it feels to have so
much money."There being no reply to this, Miss Flora went on after a moment."It must be awful nice--to buy what you want, I mean, without fretting
about how much it costs."What would you do--if you could--if you had the money, I mean?""Well, there's three things I know I'd do.They're silly, of course,
but they're what I WANT.It's a phonygraph, and to see Niagara Falls,
and to go into Noell's restaurant and order what I want without even
looking at the prices after 'em."What's more, I hope you'll get them--some time."Why, if I had the money, I shouldn't
spend it--not for them things.I'd be needing shoes or a new dress.And
I COULDN'T be so rich I wouldn't notice what the prices was--of what I
ate.But, then, I don't believe anybody's that, not even him."She
pointed to the picture still open before them.Smith, his eyes bent upon the picture, was looking
thoughtful.He had the air of a man to whom has come a brand-new,
somewhat disconcerting idea.Miss Flora, glancing from the man to the picture, and back again, gave
a sudden exclamation."There, now I know who it is that you remind me of, Mr.Miss Flora was still interestedly
comparing the man and the picture, "But, then, that ain't so strange.Didn't you say you was a Blaisdell?""Er--y-yes, oh, yes.I'm a Blaisdell," nodded Mr."Very
likely I've got the--er--Blaisdell nose.Then he turned a leaf of
the album abruptly, decidedly.he demanded,
pointing to the tintype of a bright-faced young girl.Oh, that's my cousin Grace when she was sixteen.She died; but
she was a wonderful girl.Smith; and even the closest observer, watching his
face, could not have said that he was not absorbedly interested in Miss
Flora's story of "my cousin Grace."It was not until the last leaf of the album was reached that they came
upon the picture of a small girl, with big, hungry eyes looking out
from beneath long lashes."That's Mellicent--where you're boarding, you know--when she was
little.""But it's horrid, poor
child!""But she looks so--so sad," murmured Mr.She
hesitated, then burst out, as if irresistibly impelled from within."It's only just another case of never having what you want WHEN you
want it, Mr.And it ain't 'cause they're poor, either.They
AIN'T poor--not like me, I mean.Frank's always done well, and he's
been a good provider; but it's my sister-in-law--her way, I mean.Not
that I'm saying anything against Jane.She's a good woman, and
she's very kind to me.She's always saying what she'd do for me if she
only had the money.She's a good housekeeper, too, and her house is as
neat as wax.But it's just that she never thinks she can USE anything
she's got till it's so out of date she don't want it.I dressmake for
her, you see, so I know--about her sleeves and skirts, you know.And if
she ever does wear a decent thing she's so afraid it will rain she
never takes any comfort in it!""Well, that is--unfortunate."And she's brought up that poor child the same way.Why,
from babyhood, Mellicent never had her rattles till she wanted blocks,
nor her blocks till she wanted dolls, nor her dolls till she was big
enough for beaus!And that's what made the poor child always look so
wall-eyed and hungry.She was hungry--even if she did get enough to
eat."Blaisdell probably believed in--er--economy," hazarded Mr.But, there, I ought not to
have said anything, of course.I only wish some
other folks I could mention had more of it.There's Jim's wife, for
instance.Now, if she's got ten cents, she'll spend fifteen--and five
more to show HOW she spent it.She and Jane ought to be shaken up in a
bag together.Smith, Jane doesn't let herself enjoy anything.She's always keeping it for a better time.Though sometimes I think she
DOES enjoy just seeing how far she can make a dollar go.But Mellicent
don't, nor Frank; and it's hard on them."Smith was looking at the wistful eyes
under the long lashes."'T is; and 't ain't right, I believe.There IS such a thing as being
too economical.I tell Jane she'll be like a story I read once about a
man who pinched and saved all his life, not even buying peanuts, though
he just doted on 'em.And when he did get rich, so he could buy the
peanuts, he bought a big bag the first thing.He
hadn't got any teeth left to chew 'em with."Smith, as he pocketed his
notebook and rose to his feet."And now I thank you very much, Miss
Blaisdell, for the help you've been to me.""Oh, you're quite welcome, indeed you are, Mr.Smith," beamed Miss
Blaisdell."It's done me good, just to talk to you about all these
folks and pictures.I do get lonesome sometimes, all
alone, so!and I ain't so busy as I wish I was, always.But I'm afraid
I haven't helped you much--just this.""Oh, yes, you have--perhaps more than think," smiled the man, with an
odd look in his eyes.Well, I'm glad, I'm sure.And don't forget to go to Maggie's,
now.And she'll be so glad
to show you!""All right, thank you; I'll surely interview--Miss Maggie," smiled the
man in good-bye.He had almost said "poor" Maggie himself, though why she should be POOR
Maggie had come to be an all-absorbing question with him.He had been
tempted once to ask Miss Flora, but something had held him back.That
evening at the supper table, however, in talking with Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell, the question came again to his lips; and this time it found
utterance.Jane herself had introduced Miss Maggie's name, and had said an
inconsequential something about her when Mr.Blaisdell, please,--may I ask?I must confess to a great
curiosity as to why Miss Duff is always 'poor Maggie.'""Why, really, I don't know," she answered, "only it just comes natural,
that's all.I did it again,
didn't I?That only goes to show how we all do it, unconsciously."Frank Blaisdell, across the table, gave a sudden emphatic sniff.Well, I guess if you had to live with Father Duff, Jane, it
would be 'poor Jane' with you, all right!""Father Duff's a trial, and no mistake.Aunt Maggie's a saint--that's what she is!"It was Mellicent who
spoke, her young voice vibrant with suppressed feeling."She's the
dearest thing ever!There COULDN'T be anybody better than Aunt Maggie!"Nothing more was said just then, but in the evening, later, after
Mellicent had gone to walk with young Pennock, and her father had gone
back down to the store, Mrs.Blaisdell took up the matter of "Poor
Maggie" again."I've been thinking what you said," she began, "about our calling her
'poor Maggie,' and I've made up my mind it's because we're all so sorry
for her.You see, she's been so unfortunate, as I said.I've so often wished there was something I could do for her.Of course,
if we only had money--but we haven't; so I can't.And even money
wouldn't take away her father, either.I didn't mean that,
really,--not the way it sounded," broke off Mrs.Blaisdell, in shocked
apology."I only meant that she'd have her father to care for, just the
same.""He's something of a trial, I take it, eh?"How ever she endures it, I
can't imagine.Of course, we call him Father Duff, but he's really not
any relation to us--I mean to Frank and the rest.But their mother
married him when they were children, and they never knew their own
father much, so he's the father they know.When their mother died,
Maggie had just entered college.She was eighteen, and such a pretty
girl!"Well, of course Maggie had to come home right away.None of the rest
wanted to take care of him and Maggie had to.There was another Duff
sister then--a married sister (she's died since), but SHE wouldn't take
him, so Maggie had to.Of course, none of the Blaisdells wanted the
care of him--and he wasn't their father, anyway.Frank was wanting to
marry me, and Jim and Flora were in school and wanted to stay there, of
course.She was so
ambitious, and so fond of books.But she came, and went right into the
home and kept it so Frank and Jim and Flora could live there just the
same as when their mother was alive.And she had to do all the work,
too.Kind of hard, wasn't it?--and
Maggie only eighteen!"Smith's lips came together a bit grimly."Well, after a time Frank and Jim married, and there was only Flora and
Father Duff at home.Poor Maggie tried then to go to college again.She
was over twenty-one, and supposed to be her own mistress, of course.She found a place where she could work and pay her way through college,
and Flora said she'd keep the house and take care of Father Duff.But,
dear me; it wasn't a month before that ended, and Maggie had to come
home again.Flora wasn't strong, and the work fretted her.Besides, she
never could get along with Father Duff, and she was trying to learn
dressmaking, too.She stuck it out till she got sick, though, then of
course Maggie had to come back."She
persuaded her father to get a girl.The
first girl and her father fought like cats and dogs, and the last time
she got one her father was taken sick, and again she had to come home.Some way, it's always been that way with poor Maggie.No sooner does
she reach out to take something than it's snatched away, just as she
thinks she's got it.Why, there was her father's cousin George--he was
going to help her once.But a streak of bad luck hit him at just that
minute, and he gave out."He's done
well, too, they say, and I always thought he'd send back something; but
he never has.There was some trouble, I believe, between him and Father
Duff at the time he went to Alaska, so that explains it, probably.Anyway, he's never done anything for them.Well, when he gave out,
Maggie just gave up college then, and settled down to take care of her
father, though I guess she's always studied some at home; and I know
that for years she didn't give up hope but that she could go some time."Why, let me see--forty-three, forty-four--yes, she's forty-five.She
had her forty-third birthday here--I remember I gave her a handkerchief
for a birthday present--when she was helping me take care of Mellicent
through the pneumonia; and that was two years ago.She used to come
here and to Jim's and Flora's days at a time; but she isn't quite so
free as she was--Father Duff's worse now, and she don't like to leave
him nights, much, so she can't come to us so often."And
just what is the matter with Mr.Jane Blaisdell gave a short laugh and shrugged her
shoulders."Everything's the matter--with Father Duff!Oh, it's nerves,
mostly, the doctor says, and there are some other things--long names
that I can't remember.But, as I said, everything's the matter with
Father Duff.He's one of those men where there isn't anything quite
right.Frank says he's got so he just objects to everything--on general
principles.If it's blue, he says it ought to be black, you know.And,
really, I don't know but Frank's right.How Maggie stands him I don't
see; but she's devotion itself.Why, she even gave up her lover years
ago, for him.She wouldn't leave her father, and, of course, nobody
would think of taking HIM into the family, when he wasn't BORN into it,
so the affair was broken off.I don't know, really, as Maggie cared
much.She never was one to carry her heart on
her sleeve.I've always so wished I could do something for
her!But, then, you asked, and you're interested,
I know, and that's what you're here for--to find out about the
Blaisdells.""To--to--f-find out--" stammered Mr."Yes, for your book, I mean.""Oh, yes--of course; for my book," agreed Mr.He
had the guilty air of a small boy who has almost been caught in a raid
on the cooky jar."And although poor Maggie isn't really a Blaisdell herself, she's
nearly one; and they've got lots of Blaisdell records down there--among
Mother Blaisdell's things, you know.I'll want to see those, of course," declared Mr.Smith, rising to his feet, preparatory to going to his own room.CHAPTER VI

POOR MAGGIE


It was some days later that Mr.Smith asked Benny one afternoon to show
him the way to Miss Maggie Duff's home."Sure I will," agreed Benny with alacrity."You don't ever have ter do
any teasin' ter get me ter go ter Aunt Maggie's.""You're fond of Aunt Maggie, then, I take it."Why, I don't know
anybody that don't like Aunt Maggie.""I'm sure that speaks well--for Aunt Maggie," smiled Mr.A feller can take some comfort at Aunt Maggie's," continued
Benny, trudging along at Mr."She don't have anythin'
just for show, that you can't touch, like 'tis at my house, and there
ain't anythin' but what you can use without gettin' snarled up in a
mess of covers an' tidies, like 'tis at Aunt Jane's.But Aunt Maggie
don't save anythin', Aunt Jane says, an' she'll die some day in the
poor-house, bein' so extravagant."Well, really, Benny, I--er--" hesitated the man."Well, I don't believe she will," repeated Benny."I hope she won't,
anyhow.Poorhouses ain't very nice, are they?""I--I don't think I know very much about them, Benny.""Well, I don't believe they are, from what Aunt Jane says.And if they
ain't, I don't want Aunt Maggie ter go.She hadn't ought ter have
anythin'--but Heaven--after Grandpa Duff.He's got a chronic grouch, ma says.It means it keeps goin' without stoppin'--the rheumatism, I
mean, not the folks that's got it.THEY don't go at all, sometimes.Cole don't, and that's what he's got.But when I asked ma what a
grouch was, she said little boys should be seen and not heard.Ma
always says that when she don't want to answer my questions."Oh, are you POOR, too?"Well, that is, I--I--"

"Ma was wonderin' yesterday what you lived on.Haven't you got any
money, Mr."Oh, yes, Benny, I've got money enough--to live on."Smith spoke
promptly, and with confidence this time.You're glad, then, ain't you?Ma says we haven't--got
enough ter live on, I mean; but pa says we have, if we didn't try ter
live like everybody else lives what's got more."Smith bit his lip, and looked down a little apprehensively at the
small boy at his side."I--I'm not sure, Benny, but _I_ shall have to say little boys should
be seen and not--" He stopped abruptly.Benny, with a stentorian shout,
had run ahead to a gate before a small white cottage.On the cozy,
vine-shaded porch sat a white-haired old man leaning forward on his
cane."Hi, there, Grandpa Duff, I've brought somebody ter see ye!"The gate
was open now, and Benny was halfway up the short walk.Smith doffed his hat and came forward.The man on the porch looked up sharply from beneath heavy brows.Smith, on the topmost step, hesitated."Is
your--er--daughter in, Mr.His somewhat unfriendly gaze was still bent
upon the newcomer."Just what do you want of my daughter?""Why, I--I--" Plainly nonplused, the man paused uncertainly.Then, with
a resumption of his jaunty cheerfulness, he smiled straight into the
unfriendly eyes.Duff,--records of the
Blaisdell family.I'm compiling a book on--

"Humph!Duff curtly, settling back
in his chair."As I said, I've heard of you.But you needn't come here
asking your silly questions.I shan't tell you a thing, anyway, if you
do.It's none of your business who lived and died and what they did
before you were born.If the Lord had wanted you to know he'd 'a' put
you here then instead of now!"Looking very much as if he had received a blow in the face, Mr."Aw, grandpa"--began Benny, in grieved expostulation.But a cheery
voice interrupted, and Mr.Smith turned to see Miss Maggie Duff
emerging from the doorway.she greeted him, extending a cordial
hand.For only the briefest of minutes he hesitated.Could she
have heard, and yet speak so unconcernedly?And
yet--He took the chair she offered--but with a furtive glance toward
the old man.Smith tells me he has come to see those records.Now, I'm--"

"Oh, father, dear, you couldn't!"interrupted his daughter with
admonishing earnestness."You mustn't go and get all those down!"Smith almost gasped aloud in his amazement, but Miss Maggie did not
seem to notice him at all.)"Why, father, you couldn't--they're too
heavy for you!There are the Bible, and all those papers.Besides, I shouldn't think you'd want
to get them!"Smith, hearing this, almost gasped aloud in his amazement, he
quite did so at what happened next.His mouth actually fell open as he
saw the old man rise to his feet with stern dignity.I'm not quite in my dotage yet.I guess I'm
still able to fetch downstairs a book and a bundle of papers."With his
thumping cane a resolute emphasis to every other step, the old man
hobbled into the house."There, grandpa, that's the talk!""But you said--"

"Er--Benny, dear," interposed Miss Maggie, in a haste so precipitate
that it looked almost like alarm, "run into the pantry and see what you
can find in the cooky jar."The last of her sentence was addressed to
Benny's flying heels as they disappeared through the doorway.Smith searched the woman's face for some hint, some
sign that this extraordinary shift-about was recognized and understood;
but Miss Maggie, with a countenance serenely expressing only cheerful
interest, was over by the little stand, rearranging the pile of books
and newspapers on it."I think, after all," she began thoughtfully, pausing in her work,
"that it will be better indoors.It blows so out here that you'll be
bothered in your copying, I am afraid."She was still standing at the table, chatting about the papers,
however, when at the door, a few minutes later, appeared her father, in
his arms a big Bible, and a sizable pasteboard box."Right here, father, please," she said then, to Mr.The old man frowned and cast disapproving eyes on his daughter and the
table.I don't want them there," he observed coldly.With the words he turned back into the house.Smith's bewildered eyes searched Miss Maggie's face and
once again they found nothing but serene unconcern."This way, please," she directed cheerily.And, still marveling, he
followed her into the house.Smith thought he had never seen so charming a living-room.A
comfortable chair invited him, and he sat down.He felt suddenly rested
and at home, and at peace with the world.Realizing that, in some way,
the room had produced this effect, he looked curiously about him,
trying to solve the secret of it.Reluctantly to himself he confessed that it was a very ordinary room.The carpet was poor, and was badly worn.The chairs, while comfortable
looking, were manifestly not expensive, and had seen long service.Simple curtains were at the windows, and a few fair prints were on the
walls.Two or three vases, of good lines but cheap materials, held
flowers, and there was a plain but roomy set of shelves filled with
books--not immaculate, leather-backed, gilt-lettered "sets" but rows of
dingy, worn volumes, whose very shabbiness was at once an invitation
and a promise.Smith see protecting cover
mat, or tidy.He decided then that this must be why he felt suddenly so
rested and at peace with all mankind.Even as the conviction came to
him, however he was suddenly aware that everything was not, after all,
peaceful or harmonious.Duff and his daughter were arranging the Bible and the
papers.Miss Maggie suggested piles in a certain order: her father
promptly objected, and arranged them otherwise.Miss Maggie placed the
papers first for perusal: her father said "Absurd!"Miss Maggie started to draw up a chair to the table: her father
derisively asked her if she expected a man to sit in that--and drew up
a different one.Smith, when he was finally invited to take a
seat at the table, found everything quite the most convenient and
comfortable possible.Once more into Miss Maggie's face he sent a sharply inquiring glance,
and once more he encountered nothing but unruffled cheerfulness.With a really genuine interest in the records before him, Mr.The Bible had been in the Blaisdell family for
generations, and it was full of valuable names and dates.Duff, on the other side of the table, was arranging into piles the
papers before him.He complained of the draft, and Miss Maggie shut the
window.He said then that he didn't mean he wanted to suffocate, and
she opened the one on the other side.The clock had hardly struck three
when he accused her of having forgotten his medicine.Yet when she
brought it he refused to take it.She had not brought the right kind of
spoon, he said, and she knew perfectly well he never took it out of
that narrow-bowl kind.He complained of the light, and she lowered the
curtain; but he told her that he didn't mean he didn't want to see at
all, so she put it up halfway.He said his coat was too warm, and she
brought another one.He put it on grudgingly, but he declared that it
was as much too thin as the other was too thick.Smith, in spite of his efforts to be politely deaf and blind, found
himself unable to confine his attention to birth, death, and marriage
notices.Once he almost uttered an explosive "Good Heavens, how do you
stand it?"But he stopped himself just in time, and
fiercely wrote with a very black mark that Submit Blaisdell was born in
eighteen hundred and one.Duff's attention was frowningly turned across the table toward himself."If you will spend your time over such silly stuff, why don't you use a
bigger book?""Because it wouldn't fit my pocket," smiled Mr."Just what business of yours is it, anyhow, when these people lived and
died?""Why don't you let them alone, then?"Why, I--I--" Mr."Well, I can tell you it's a silly business, whatever you find.If you
find your grandfather's a bigger man than you are, you'll be proud of
it, but you ought to be ashamed of it--'cause you aren't bigger
yourself!On the other hand, if you find he ISN'T as big as you are,
you'll be ashamed of that, when you ought to be proud of it--'cause
you've gone him one better.But can't you do any work, real work?""He is doing work, real work, now, father," interposed Miss Maggie
quickly."He's having a woeful time, too.If you'd only help him, now,
and show him those papers.""Well, I shan't," he observed tartly."I'M not a fool, if he is.I'm
going out to the porch where I can get some air.""There, work as long as you like, Mr.I knew you'd rather work
by yourself," nodded Miss Maggie, moving the piles of papers nearer him."But, good Heavens, how do you stand--" exploded Mr.Smith before he
realized that this time he had really said the words aloud."After all, it
doesn't matter.You couldn't help
seeing--how things were, of course, and I forgot, for a moment, that
you were a stranger.You see,
father is nervous, and not at all well."But do you mean that you always have to tell him to do what you don't
want, in order to--well--that is--" Mr.Smith, finding himself in very
deep water, blushed again painfully.Miss Maggie met his dismayed gaze with cheerful candor."Tell him to do what I DON'T want in order to get him to do what I do
want him to?But I don't mind; really I don't.And when you know how, what does it matter?To most of the world we say, 'Please do,' when we
want a thing, while to him we have to say, 'Please don't.'You see, it's really very simple--when you know how."He wanted to say more; but
Miss Maggie, with a smiling nod, turned away, so he went back to his
work.Benny, wandering in from the kitchen, with both hands full of cookies,
plumped himself down on the cushioned window-seat, and drew a sigh of
content.The blithe voice and pleasant smile took all the sting
from the prompt refusal.Maybe pa would--a little; but Bess and ma wouldn't.Miss Maggie crossed to a little stand and picked up
a small box.Benny shifted his now depleted stock of cookies to one hand, dropped to
his knees on the floor, and dumped the contents of the box upon the
seat before him."They won't let me eat cookies any more at home--in the house, I mean."But you know you have to pick up your crumbs here, dear."But I don't mind--after I've had the fun of eatin' first.But
they won't let me drop 'em ter begin with, there, nor take any of the
boys inter the house.Honest, Aunt Maggie, there ain't anything a
feller can do,'seems so, if ye live on the West Side," he persisted
soberly.Smith, copying dates at the table, was conscious of a slightly
apprehensive glance in his direction from Miss Maggie's eyes, as she
murmured:--

"But you're forgetting your puzzle, Benny."I can't do puzzles there, either.""All the more reason, then, why you should like to do them here.See,
where does this dog's head go?"Listlessly Benny took the bit of pictured wood in his fingers and began
to fit it into the pattern before him."I used ter do 'em an' leave 'em 'round, but ma says I can't now.Callers might come and find 'em, an' what would they say--on the West
Side!An' that's the way 'tis with everything.Ma an' Bess are always
doin' things, or not doin' 'em, for those callers."Yes, yes, dear, but they will, when they get acquainted.You haven't
found where the dog's head goes yet.""Pa says he don't want ter get acquainted.He'd rather have the old
friends, what don't mind baked beans, an' shirt-sleeves, an' doin' yer
own work, an' what thinks more of yer heart than they do of yer
pocketbook.An' say, we have ter wash our
hands every meal now--on the table, I mean--in those little glass
wash-dishes.Ma went down an' bought some, an' she's usin' 'em every
day, so's ter get used to 'em.She says everybody that is anybody has
'em nowadays.Bess thinks they're great, but I don't.I don't like 'em
a mite."It doesn't matter--it doesn't really matter,
does it, if you do have to use the little dishes?Come, you're not half
doing the puzzle."Benny shifted his position, and picked up a three-cornered
bit of wood carrying the picture of a dog's paw.You see, things are so different--on the West Side.Miss Maggie turned from the puzzle with a start.It's keepin' books for a man.It brings in
quite a lot extry, ma says; but she wouldn't let me have some new
roller skates when mine broke.She's savin' up for a chafin' dish.You eat out of it, some way--I
mean, it cooks things ter eat; an' Bess wants one.ALL our eatin's different,'seems so, on the West Side.Ma has
dinners nights now, instead of noons.She says the Pennocks do, an'
everybody does who is anybody.Pa don't, either,
an' half the time he can't get home in time for it, anyhow, on account
of gettin' back to his new job, ye know, an'--"

"Oh, I've found where the dog's head goes," cried Miss Maggie, There
was a hint of desperation in her voice."I shall have your puzzle all
done for you myself, if you don't look out, Benny.I don't believe you
can do it, anyhow."retorted Benny, with sudden
spirit, falling to work in earnest."I never saw a puzzle yet I
couldn't do!"Smith, bending assiduously over his work at the table, heard Miss
Maggie's sigh of relief--and echoed it, from sympathy.CHAPTER VII

POOR MAGGIE AND SOME OTHERS


It was half an hour later, when Mr.Smith and Benny were walking across
the common together, that Benny asked an abrupt question."Is Aunt Maggie goin' ter be put in your book, Mr."Why--er--yes; her name will be entered as the daughter of the man who
married the Widow Blaisdell, probably.Aunt Maggie don't have
nothin' much, yer know, except her father an' housework--housework
either for him or some of us.An' I guess she's had quite a lot of
things ter bother her, an' make her feel bad, so I hoped she'd be in
the book.Though if she wasn't, she'd just laugh an' say it doesn't
matter, of course."Yes, when things plague, an' somethin' don't go right.She says it
helps a lot ter just remember that it doesn't matter."Well, no,--I don't think I do see," frowned Mr."Oh, yes," plunged in Benny; "'cause, you see, if yer stop ter think
about it--this thing that's plaguin' ye--you'll see how really small
an' no-account it is, an' how, when you put it beside really big things
it doesn't matter at all--it doesn't REALLY matter, ye know.Aunt
Maggie says she's done it years an' years, ever since she was just a
girl, an' somethin' bothered her; an' it's helped a lot.""But there are lots of things that DO matter," persisted Mr.Benny swelled a bit importantly, "I know what you mean.Aunt
Maggie says that, too; an' she says we must be very careful an' not get
it wrong.It's only the little things that bother us, an' that we wish
were different, that we must say 'It doesn't matter' about.It DOES
matter whether we're good an' kind an' tell the truth an' shame the
devil; but it DOESN'T matter whether we have ter live on the West Side
an' eat dinner nights instead of noons, an' not eat cookies any of the
time in the house,--see?""Good for you, Benny,--and good for Aunt Maggie!"Oh, you don't know Aunt Maggie, yet.She's always tryin'
ter make people think things don't matter.A moment later he had turned down his own street, and Mr.Very often, in the days that followed, Mr.Smith thought of this speech
of Benny's.He had opportunity to verify it, for he was seeing a good
deal of Miss Maggie, and it seemed, indeed, to him that half the town
was coming to her to learn that something "didn't matter"--though very
seldom, except to Benny, did he hear her say the words themselves.It
was merely that to her would come men, women, and children, each with a
sorry tale of discontent or disappointment.And it was always as if
they left with her their burden, for when they turned away, head and
shoulders were erect once more, eyes were bright, and the step was
alert and eager.For that matter, he wondered how she
did--a great many things.Smith was, indeed, seeing a good deal of Miss Maggie these days.He
told himself that it was the records that attracted him.Sometimes he just sat in one of the comfortable
chairs and watched Miss Maggie, content if she gave him a word now and
then.He liked the way she carried her head, and the way her hair waved away
from her shapely forehead.He liked the quiet strength of the way her
capable hands lay motionless in her lap when their services were not
required.He liked to watch for the twinkle in her eye, and for the
dimple in her cheek that told a smile was coming.He liked to hear her
talk to Benny.He even liked to hear her talk to her father--when he
could control his temper sufficiently.Best of all he liked his own
comfortable feeling of being quite at home, and at peace with all the
world--the feeling that always came to him now whenever he entered the
house, in spite of the fact that the welcome accorded him by Mr.Duff
was hardly more friendly than at the first.Smith it was a matter of small moment whether Mr.Duff welcomed
him cordially or not.He even indulged now and then in a bout of his
own with the gentleman, chuckling inordinately when results showed that
he had pitched his remark at just the right note of contrariety to get
what he wanted.Smith, at least nominally, spent his
time at his legitimate task of studying and copying the Blaisdell
family records, of which he was finding a great number.Rufus Blaisdell
apparently had done no little "digging" himself in his own day, and Mr.Smith told Miss Maggie that it was all a great "find" for him.She said that she was glad if she could be
of any help to him, and she told him to come whenever he liked.She
arranged the Bible and the big box of papers on a little table in the
corner, and told him to make himself quite at home; and she showed so
plainly that she regarded him as quite one of the family, that Mr.Smith might be pardoned for soon considering himself so.It was while at work in this corner that he came to learn so much of
Miss Maggie's daily life, and of her visitors.Although many of these visitors were strangers to him, some of them he
knew.Hattie Blaisdell, with a countenance even more
florid than usual.She was breathless and excited, and her eyes were
worried.She was going to give a luncheon, she said.She wanted Miss
Maggie's silver spoons, and her forks, and her hand painted
sugar-and-creamer, and Mother Blaisdell's cut-glass dish.Smith, supposing that Miss Maggie herself was to be at the
luncheon, was just rejoicing within him that she was to have this
pleasant little outing, when he heard Mrs.Blaisdell telling her to be
sure to come at eleven to be in the kitchen, and asking where could she
get a maid to serve in the dining-room, and what should she do with
Benny.He'd have to be put somewhere, or else he'd be sure to upset
everything.Smith did not hear Miss Maggie's answer to all this, for she
hurried her visitor to the kitchen at once to look up the spoons, she
said.But indirectly he obtained a very conclusive reply; for he found
Miss Maggie gone one day when he came; and Benny, who was in her place,
told him all about it, even to the dandy frosted cake Aunt Maggie had
made for the company to eat.Jane had a tired
frown between her brows and a despairing droop to her lips.She carried
a large bundle which she dropped unceremoniously into Miss Maggie's lap."There, I'm dead beat out, and I've brought it to you.You've just got
to help me," she finished, sinking into a chair."Why, of course, if I can.Miss Maggie's deft fingers
were already untying the knot.But I thought the last time it couldn't ever be done again.""Yes, I know; but there's lots of good in it yet," interposed Mrs.Jane
decidedly; "and I've bought new velvet and new lace, and some buttons
and a new lining.I THOUGHT I could do it alone, but I've reached a
point where I just have got to have help."Yes, of course, but"--Miss Maggie was lifting a half-finished sleeve
doubtfully--"why didn't you go to Flora?She'd know exactly--"

Mrs."Because I can't afford to go to Flora," she interrupted coldly."I
have to pay Flora, and you know it.If I had the money I should be glad
to do it, of course.But I haven't, and charity begins at home I think.Besides, I do go to her for NEW dresses.Of
course, if you don't WANT to help me--"

"Oh, but I do," plunged in Miss Maggie hurriedly."Come out into the
kitchen where we'll have more room," she exclaimed, gathering the
bundle into her arms and springing to her feet."I've got some other lace at home--yards and yards.I got a lot, it was
so cheap," recounted Mrs."But I'm afraid
it won't do for this, and I don't know as it will do for anything, it's
so--"

The kitchen door slammed sharply, and Mr.Half an
hour later, however, he saw Mrs.The frown was
gone from her face and the droop from the corners of her mouth.Miss Flora's thin little face looked
more pinched than ever, and her eyes more anxious, Mr.Smith's greeting, was so wan he
wished she had not tried to give it.She sat down then, by the window, and began to chat with Miss Maggie;
and very soon Mr.Smith heard her say this:--

"No, Maggie, I don't know, really, what I am going to do--truly I
don't.Why, I don't earn enough to pay my
rent, hardly, now, ter say nothin' of my feed.""But I thought that Hattie--ISN'T Hattie having some new dresses--and
Bessie, too?""Yes, oh, yes; they are having three or four.But they don't come to ME
any more.They've gone to that French woman that makes the Pennocks'
things, you know, with the queer name.And of course it's all right,
and you can't blame 'em, livin' on the West Side, as they do now.And,
of course, I ain't so up ter date as she is.(Miss Maggie laughed merrily, but Mr.Smith, copying dates at the table, detected a note in the laugh that
was not merriment.)"You're up to date enough for me.I've got just the
job for you, too."Why, Maggie, you haven't, either!"(In spite of the
incredulity of voice and manner, Miss Flora sprang joyfully to her
feet.)"You never had me make you a--" Again the kitchen door slammed
shut, and Mr.Smith was left to finish the sentence for himself.Neither was his face
expressing just then the sympathy which might be supposed to be
showing, after so sorry a tale as Miss Flora had been telling.Smith, with an actual elation of countenance, was
scribbling on the edge of his notebook words that certainly he had
never found in the Blaisdell records before him: "Two months more,
then--a hundred thousand dollars.Half an hour later, as on the previous day, Mr.Smith saw a
metamorphosed woman hurrying down the little path to the street.But
the woman to-day was carrying a bundle--and it was the same bundle that
the woman the day before had brought.Smith soon learned, were Miss Maggie's visitors
women.Besides Benny, with his grievances, young Fred Blaisdell came
sometimes, and poured into Miss Maggie's sympathetic ears the story of
Gussie Pennock's really remarkable personality, or of what he was going
to do when he went to college--and afterwards.Jim Blaisdell drifted in quite frequently Sunday afternoons, though
apparently all he came for was to smoke and read in one of the big
comfortable chairs.Smith himself had fallen into the way of
strolling down to Miss Maggie's almost every Sunday after dinner.Frank Blaisdell rattled up to the door in
his grocery wagon.His face was very red, and his mutton-chop whiskers
were standing straight out at each side.Jane had collapsed, he said, utterly collapsed.All the week she had
been house-cleaning and doing up curtains; and now this morning,
expressly against his wishes, to save hiring a man, she had put down
the parlor carpet herself.Now she was flat on her back, and supper to
be got for the boarder, and the Saturday baking yet to be done.And
could Maggie come and help them out?Smith hurried out from his corner
and insisted that "the boarder" did not want any supper anyway--and
could they not live on crackers and milk for the coming few days?But Miss Maggie laughed and said, "Nonsense!"And in an incredibly
short time she was ready to drive back in the grocery wagon.Later,
when he went home, Mr.Smith found her there, presiding over one of the
best suppers he had eaten since his arrival in Hillerton.She came
every day after that, for a week, for Mrs.Jane remained "flat on her
back" seven days, with a doctor in daily attendance, supplemented by a
trained nurse peremptorily ordered by that same doctor from the nearest
city.Miss Maggie, with the assistance of Mellicent, attended to the
housework.But in spite of the excellence of the cuisine, meal time was
a most unhappy period to everybody concerned, owing to the sarcastic
comments of Mr.Frank Blaisdell as to how much his wife had "saved" by
not having a man to put down that carpet.Mellicent had little time now to go walking or auto-riding with Carl
Pennock.Her daily life was, indeed, more pleasure-starved than
ever--all of which was not lost on Mr.Smith and Mellicent
were fast friends now.Given a man with a sympathetic understanding on
one side, and a girl hungry for that same sympathy and understanding,
and it could hardly be otherwise.Smith
knew now just how hungry a young girl can be for fun and furbelows."Of course I've got my board and clothes, and I ought to be thankful
for them," she stormed hotly to him one day.But sometimes it seems as if I'd actually be willing to go hungry
for meat and potato, if for once--just once--I could buy a five-pound
box of candy, and eat it up all at once, if I wanted to!But now, why
now I can't even treat a friend to an ice-cream soda without seeing
mother's shocked, reproachful eyes over the rim of the glass!"It was not easy then (nor many times subsequently) for Mr.Smith to
keep from asking Mellicent the utterly absurd question of how many
five-pound boxes of candy she supposed one hundred thousand dollars
would buy.But he did keep from it--by heroic self-sacrifice and the
comforting recollection that she would know some day, if she cared to
take the trouble to reckon it up.In Mellicent's love affair with young Pennock Mr.Not that he regarded it as really serious, but because it
appeared to bring into Mellicent's life something of the youth and
gayety to which he thought she was entitled.He was almost as concerned
as was Miss Maggie, therefore, when one afternoon, soon after Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's complete recovery from her "carpet tax" (as Frank Blaisdell
termed his wife's recent illness), Mellicent rushed into the Duff
living-room with rose-red cheeks and blazing eyes, and an
explosive:--"Aunt Maggie, Aunt Maggie, can't you get mother to let me
go away somewhere--anywhere, right off?"[Illustration caption: "I CAN'T HELP IT, AUNT MAGGIE.I'VE JUST GOT TO
BE AWAY!"]And just to-morrow the Pennocks' dance?""But that's it--that's why I want to go," flashed Mellicent."I don't
want to be at the dance--and I don't want to be in town, and NOT at the
dance."Smith, at his table in the corner, glanced nervously toward the
door, then bent assiduously over his work, as being less conspicuous
than the flight he had been tempted for a moment to essay.But even
this was not to be, for the next moment, to his surprise, the girl
appealed directly to him.Smith, please, won't YOU take me somewhere to-morrow?"Even Miss Maggie was shocked now, and showed it."I can't help it, Aunt Maggie."But, my dear, to ASK a gentleman--" reproved Miss Maggie.She came to
an indeterminate pause.Smith had crossed the room and dropped into
a chair near them."See here, little girl, suppose you tell us just what is behind--all
this," he began gently.Please let it go that I want to be away."Mellicent, we can't do that.""We can't do--anything, until you tell us what it is."Mellicent's eyes, still mutinous, sought first
the kindly questioning face of the man, then the no less kindly but
rather grave face of the woman.Then in a little breathless burst it
came."It's just something they're all saying Mrs.Two little red spots had come into Miss Maggie's cheeks."It was just that--that they weren't going to let Carl Pennock go with
me any more--anywhere, or come to see me, because I--I didn't belong to
their set."Miss Maggie said nothing, but the red spots deepened.It's just--that we aren't rich like them."That you haven't got--got--Oh, ye gods!"Almost
instantly, however, he sobered: he had caught the expression of the two
faces opposite."I beg your pardon," he apologized promptly."It was only that to
me--there was something very funny about that.""But, Mellicent, are you sure?I don't believe she ever said it,"
doubted Miss Maggie."He hasn't been near me--for a week."I don't care a bit--not a bit--about THAT!"What does
it matter if she did say it, dear?"But I can't bear to have them all talk--and notice," choked Mellicent."And we were together such a lot before; and now--I tell you I CAN'T go
to that dance to-morrow night!""And you shan't, if you don't want to," Mr."Right
here and now I invite you and your Aunt Maggie to drive with me
to-morrow to Hubbardville.There are some records there that I want to
look up.It will take all day, and we
shan't be home till late in the evening.I'll go straight now
and telephone to somebody--everybody--that I shan't be there; that I'm
going to be OUT OF TOWN!"She sprang joyously to her feet--but Miss
Maggie held out a restraining hand.You don't care--you SAID you didn't care--that
Carl Pennock doesn't come to see you any more?""Then you wouldn't want others to think you did, would you?""You have said that you'd go to this party, haven't you?That is, you
accepted the invitation, didn't you, and people know that you did,
don't they?"But--just what do you think these people are going to say
to-morrow night, when you aren't there?""Why, that I--I--" The color drained from her face and left it white."They wouldn't EXPECT me to go after that--insult.""Then they'll understand that you--CARE, won't they?""Why, I--I--They--I CAN'T--" She turned sharply and walked to the
window.For a long minute she stood, her back toward the two watching
her.Then, with equal abruptness, she turned and came back.Her cheeks
were very pink now, her eyes very bright.She carried her head with a
proud little lift.Smith, that I won't go with you to-morrow, after all,"
she said steadily."I've decided to go--to that dance."The next moment the door shut crisply behind her.CHAPTER VIII

A SANTA CLAUS HELD UP


It was about five months after the multi-millionaire, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton, had started for South America, that Edward D. Norton, Esq.,
received the following letter:--

DEAR NED:--I'm glad there's only one more month to wait.I feel like
Santa Claus with a box of toys, held up by a snowdrift, and I just
can't wait to see the children dance--when they get them.And let me say right here and now how glad I am that I did this thing.Oh, yes, I'll admit I still feel like the small boy at the keyhole, at
times, perhaps; but I'll forget that--when the children begin to dance.And, really, never have I seen a bunch of people whom I thought a
little money would do more good to than the Blaisdells here in
Hillerton.My only regret is that I didn't know about Miss Maggie Duff,
so that she could have had some, too.(Oh, yes, I've found out all
about "Poor Maggie" now, and she's a dear--the typical
self-sacrificing, self-effacing bearer of everybody's burdens,
including a huge share of her own!)However, she isn't a Blaisdell, of
course, so I couldn't have worked her into my scheme very well, I
suppose, even if I had known about her.They are all fond of
her--though they impose on her time and her sympathies abominably.But
I reckon she'll get some of the benefits of the others' thousands.Jane, in particular, is always wishing she could do something for "Poor
Maggie," so I dare say she'll be looked out for all right.As to who will prove to be the wisest handler of the hundred thousand,
and thus my eventual heir, I haven't the least idea.As I said before,
they all need money, and need it badly--need it to be comfortable and
happy, I mean.They aren't really poor, any of them, except, perhaps,
Miss Flora.She is a little hard up, poor soul.I
wonder what she'll get first, Niagara, the phonograph, or something to
eat without looking at the price.Did I ever write you about those
"three wishes" of hers?I can't see that any of the family are really extravagant unless,
perhaps, it's Mrs.She IS ambitious, and is inclined
to live on a scale a little beyond her means, I judge.But that will be
all right, of course, when she has the money to gratify her tastes.Jim--poor fellow, I shall be glad to see him take it easy, for once.He
reminds me of the old horse I saw the other day running one of those
infernal treadmill threshing machines--always going, but never getting
there.He works, and works hard, and then he gets a job nights and
works harder; but he never quite catches up with his bills, I fancy.What a world of solid comfort he'll take with that hundred thousand!I
can hear him draw the long breath now--for once every bill paid!Of course, the Frank Blaisdells are the most thrifty of the bunch--at
least, Mrs.Frank, "Jane," is--and I dare say they would be the most
conservative handlers of my millions.Anyhow, I
shall be glad to see them enjoy themselves meanwhile with the hundred
thousand.Jane will be constrained to clear my room of a few
of the mats and covers and tidies!At least, I shall
surely have a vacation from her everlasting "We can't afford it," and
her equally everlasting "Of course, if I had the money I'd do it."Praise be for that!--and it'll be worth a hundred thousand to me,
believe me, Ned.As for her husband--I'm not sure how he will take it.It isn't corn or
peas or flour or sugar, you see, and I'm not posted as to his opinion
of much of anything else.He'll spend some of it, though,--I'm sure of
that.I don't think he always thoroughly appreciates his wife's thrifty
ideas of economy.I haven't forgotten the night I came home to find
Mrs.Frank rampaging around the house with
every gas jet at full blast.It seems he was packing his bag to go on a
hurried business trip.He laughed a little sheepishly--I suppose he saw
my blinking amazement at the illumination--and said something about
being tired of always feeling his way through pitch-dark rooms.So, as
I say, I'm not quite sure of Mr.Frank when he comes into possession of
the hundred thousand.He's been cooped up in the dark so long he may
want to blow in the whole hundred thousand in one grand blare of light.However, I reckon I needn't worry--he'll still have Mrs.Jane--to turn
some of the gas jets down!As for the younger generation--they're fine, every one of them; and
just think what this money will mean to them in education and
advantages!Jim's son, Fred, eighteen, is a fine, manly boy.He's got
his mother's ambitions, and he's keen for college--even talks of
working his way (much to his mother's horror) if his father can't find
the money to send him.Of course, that part will be all right now--in a
month.The daughter, Bessie (almost seventeen), is an exceedingly pretty girl.She, too, is ambitious--almost too much so, perhaps, for her happiness,
in the present state of their pocketbook.But of course that, too, will
be all right, after next month.Benny, the nine-year-old, will be
concerned as little as any one over that hundred thousand dollars, I
imagine.The real value of the gift he will not appreciate, of course;
in fact, I doubt if he even approves of it--lest his privileges as to
meals and manners be still further curtailed.Now,
Mellicent--

Perhaps in no one do I expect to so thoroughly rejoice as I do in poor
little pleasure-starved Mellicent.I realize, of course, that it will
mean to her the solid advantages of college, music-culture, and travel;
but I must confess that in my dearest vision, the child is reveling in
one grand whirl of pink dresses and chocolate bonbons.I GAVE her one five-pound box of candy, but I never repeated the
mistake.Besides enduring the manifestly suspicious disapproval of her
mother because I had made the gift, I have had the added torment of
seeing that box of chocolates doled out to that poor child at the rate
of two pieces a day.They aren't gone yet, but I'll warrant they're as
hard as bullets--those wretched bonbons.But there is yet another phase of the money business in connection with
Mellicent that pleases me mightily.A certain youth by the name of Carl
Pennock has been beauing her around a good deal, since I came.The
Pennocks have some money--fifty thousand, or so, I believe--and it is
reported that Mrs.Pennock has put her foot down on the budding
romance--because the Blaisdells HAVE NOT GOT MONEY ENOUGH!(Begin to
see where my chuckles come in?)However true this report may be, the
fact remains that the youth has not been near the house for a month
past, nor taken Mellicent anywhere.Of course, it shows him and his
family up--for just what they are; but it has been mortifying for poor
Mellicent.She's showing her pluck like a little trump, however, and
goes serenely on her way with her head just enough in the air--but not
too much.I don't think Mellicent's real heart is affected in the least--she's
only eighteen, remember--but her pride IS.Jane
is thoroughly angry as well as mortified.She says Mellicent is every
whit as good as those Pennocks, and that the woman who would let a
paltry thing like money stand in the way of her son's affections is a
pretty small specimen.For her part, she never did have any use for
rich folks, anyway, and she is proud and glad that she's poor!However, so much
for her--and she may change her opinion one of these days.My private suspicion is that young Pennock is already repentant, and is
pulling hard at his mother's leading-strings; for I was with Mellicent
the other day when we met the lad face to face on the street.Mellicent
smiled and nodded casually, but Pennock--he turned all colors of the
rainbow with terror, pleading, apology, and assumed indifference all
racing each other across his face.Dear, dear, but he was a sight!There is, too, another feature in the case.It seems that a new family
by the name of Gaylord have come to town and opened up the old Gaylord
mansion.Gaylord is a son of old Peter Gaylord, and is a millionaire.They are making quite a splurge in the way of balls and liveried
servants, and motor cars, and the town is agog with it all.There are
young people in the family, and especially there is a girl, Miss Pearl,
whom, report says, the Pennocks have selected as being a suitable mate
for Carl.At all events the Pennocks and the Gaylords have struck up a
furious friendship, and the young people of both families are in the
forefront of innumerable social affairs--in most of which Mellicent is
left out.So now you have it--the whole story.And next month comes to
Mellicent's father one hundred thousand dollars.Do you wonder I say
the plot thickens?(The man who
says health biscuit to me now gets knocked down--and I've got the
strength to do it, too!)I've gained
twenty pounds, and I'm having the time of my life.I'm even enjoying
being a genealogist--a little.I've about exhausted the resources of
Hillerton, and have begun to make trips to the neighboring towns.I can
even spend an afternoon in an old cemetery copying dates from
moss-grown gravestones, and not entirely lose my appetite for dinner--I
mean, supper.I was even congratulating myself that I was really quite
a genealogist when, the other day, I met the REAL THING.Heavens, Ned,
that man had fourteen thousand four hundred and seventy-two dates at
his tongue's end, and he said them all over to me.He knows the name of
every Blake (he was a Blake) back to the year one, how many children
they had (and they had some families then, let me tell you!), and when
they all died, and why.I was
hunting for a certain stone and I asked him a question.It was
like setting a match to one of those Fourth-of-July flower-pot
sky-rocket affairs.That question was the match that set him going, and
thereafter he was a gushing geyser of names and dates.He began at the Blaisdells, but skipped almost at once to the
Blakes--there were a lot of them near us.In five minutes he had me
dumb from sheer stupefaction.In ten minutes he had made a century run,
and by noon he had got to the Crusades.We went through the Dark Ages
very appropriately, waiting in an open tomb for a thunderstorm to pass.We had got to the year one when I had to leave to drive back to
Hillerton.I've invited him to come to see Father Duff.I thought I'd
like to have them meet.He knows a lot about the Duffs--a Blake married
one, 'way back somewhere.I'd like to hear him and Father Duff
talk--or, rather, I'd like to hear him TRY to talk to Father Duff.Did
I ever write you Father Duff's opinion of genealogists?I'm not seeing so much of Father Duff these days.Now that it's grown a
little cooler he spends most of his time in his favorite chair before
the cook stove in the kitchen.It should be shipped by freight and read
in sections.But I wanted you to know how things are here.You can
appreciate it the more--when you come.You're not forgetting, of course, that it's on the first day of
November that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's envelope of instructions is to be
opened.As ever yours,

JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IX

"DEAR COUSIN STANLEY"


It was very early in November that Mr.Smith, coming home one
afternoon, became instantly aware that something very extraordinary had
happened.Frank Blaisdell, his wife, Jane,
and their daughter, Mellicent.Mellicent's cheeks were pink, and her
eyes more star-like than ever.Her
eyes were excited, but incredulous.Frank was still in his white
work-coat, which he wore behind the counter, but which he never wore
upstairs in his home.It was an ecstatic cry from Mellicent that came first to Mr.Smith, you can't guess what's happened!You
couldn't guess in a million years!"Smith was looking almost as happily
excited as Mellicent herself.Mellicent clasped her hands before her.Smith,
we are going to have a hundred thousand--"

"Mellicent, I wouldn't talk of it--yet," interfered her mother sharply."But, mother, it's no secret."Of course not--if it's true.But it isn't true," retorted the woman,
with excited emphasis."No man in his senses would do such a thing."Smith, looking suddenly a little less
happy."Leave a hundred thousand dollars apiece to three distant relations he
never saw.""But he was our cousin--you said he was our cousin," interposed
Mellicent, "and when he died--"

"The letter did not say he had died," corrected her mother."He just
hasn't been heard from.But he will be heard from--and then where will
our hundred thousand dollars be?""But the lawyer's coming to give it to us," maintained Mr."Here, read this,
please, and tell us if we have lost our senses--or if somebody else
has."A close observer might have noticed that his
hand shook a little.The letterhead carried the name of a Chicago law
firm, but Mr.He plunged at once into the
text of the letter.I want to hear it again," pleaded Mellicent.Smith then, after clearing his throat),--I
understand that you are a distant kinsman of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the
Chicago millionaire.Fulton left this city on what was reported to
be a somewhat extended exploring tour of South America.Before his
departure he transferred to me, as trustee, certain securities worth
about $300,000.He left with me a sealed envelope, entitled "Terms of
Trust," and instructed me to open such envelope in six months from the
date written thereon--if he had not returned--and thereupon to dispose
of the securities according to the terms of the trust.I will add that
he also left with me a second sealed envelope entitled "Last Will and
Testament," but instructed me not to open such envelope until two years
from the date written thereon.I have opened the envelope
entitled "Terms of Trust," and find that I am directed to convert the
securities into cash with all convenient speed, and forthwith to pay
over one third of the net proceeds to his kinsman, Frank G. Blaisdell;
one third to his kinsman, James A. Blaisdell; and one third to his
kinswoman, Flora B. Blaisdell, all of Hillerton.I shall, of course, discharge my duty as trustee under this instrument
with all possible promptness.Some of the securities have already been
converted into cash, and within a few days I shall come to Hillerton to
pay over the cash in the form of certified checks; and I shall ask you
at that time to be so good as to sign a receipt for your share.Meanwhile this letter is to apprise you of your good fortune and to
offer you my congratulations.Very truly yours,

EDWARD D. NORTON."Well, what do you think of it?"Frank Blaisdell, his arms
akimbo."Why, it's fine, of course."Then it's all straight, you think?""Je-hos-a-phat!""But he'll come back--you see if he don't!"You'll still have your hundred thousand," smiled Mr.I doubt if he could, if he wanted to.""And we're really going to have a whole hundred thousand dollars?""I reckon you are--less the inheritance tax, perhaps."Do you mean we've
got to PAY because we've got that money?""Why, y-yes, I suppose so.Isn't there an inheritance tax in this
State?"Jane's lips were at their most economical
pucker."Do we have to pay a GREAT deal?Isn't there any way to save
doing that?""No, there isn't," cut in her husband crisply."And I guess we can pay
the inheritance tax--with a hundred thousand to pay it out of.We're
going to SPEND some of this money, Jane."The telephone bell in the hall jangled its peremptory summons, and Mr.In a minute he returned, a new excitement on his
face.And they've got it, too, haven't they?""And Aunt Flora, and--" She stopped suddenly, a growing dismay in her
eyes."Why, he didn't--he didn't leave a cent to AUNT MAGGIE!"There was genuine concern
in Frank Blaisdell's voice."But we can give her some of ours, mother,--we can give her some of
ours," urged the girl."It isn't ours to give--yet," remarked her mother, a bit coldly."But, mother, you WILL do it," importuned Mellicent."You've always
said you would, if you had it to give.""And I say it again, Mellicent.I shall never see her suffer, you may
be sure,--if I have the money to relieve her.But--" She stopped
abruptly at the sound of an excited voice down the hall.Miss Flora,
evidently coming in through the kitchen, was hurrying toward them."Jane--Mellicent--where are you?she
panted, as she reached the room and sank into a chair."Did you ever
hear anything like it in all your life?You had one, too, didn't you?"she cried, her eyes falling on the letter in her brother's hand."But
'tain't true, of course!"Miss Flora wore no head-covering.She wore one glove (wrong side out),
and was carrying the other one.Her dress, evidently donned hastily for
the street, was unevenly fastened, showing the topmost button without a
buttonhole.Smith says it's true," triumphed Mellicent.So almost accusing was the look in her eyes that Mr."Why--er--ah--the letter speaks for itself Miss Flora," he stammered."But it CAN'T be true," reiterated Miss Flora."The idea of a man I
never saw giving me a hundred thousand dollars like that!--and Frank
and Jim, too!""But he's your cousin--you said he was your cousin," Mr."And you have his picture in your album.I didn't know HE knew I was his cousin.I
don't s'pose he's got MY picture in HIS album!It's some other Flora Blaisdell, I tell you.""There, I never thought of that," cried Jane."It probably is some
other Blaisdells.Well, anyhow, if it is, we won't have to pay that
inheritance tax.At this moment the rattling of the front-door knob and an imperative
knocking brought Mrs."There's Hattie, now, and that door's locked," she cried, hurrying into
the hall.When she returned a moment later Harriet Blaisdell and Bessie were with
her.Harriet Blaisdell a new, indescribable air of
commanding importance.Smith she appeared to have grown inches
taller."Well, I do hope, Jane, NOW you'll live in a decent place," she was
saying, as they entered the room, "and not oblige your friends to climb
up over a grocery store.""Well, I guess you can stand the grocery store a few more days, Hattie,"
observed Frank Blaisdell dryly."How long do you s'pose we'd live--any
of us--if 'twa'n't for the grocery stores to feed us?I told him I was coming here, and to come right over
himself at once; that the very first thing we must have was a family
conclave, just ourselves, you know, so as to plan what to give out to
the public."Smith was on his feet, looking somewhat embarrassed;
"perhaps, then, you would rather I were not present at the--er--family
conclave.""Why, you ARE one of the family,'seems so," cried Mellicent."Besides, you are interested in what concerns us, I know--for the book;
so, of course, you'll be interested in this legacy of dear Cousin
Stanley's."Smith collapsed suddenly behind his handkerchief, with one of the
choking coughs to which he appeared to be somewhat addicted."Ain't you getting a little familiar with 'dear Cousin Stanley,'
Hattie?""But, Hattie, we were just sayin', 'fore you came, that it couldn't be
true; that it must mean some other Blaisdells somewhere.""There couldn't be any other Frank and Jim
and Flora Blaisdell, in a Hillerton, too.Besides, Jim said over the
telephone that that was one of the best law firms in Chicago.Don't you
suppose they know what they're talking about?I'm sure, I think it's
quite the expected thing that he should leave his money to his own
people.Come, don't let's waste any more time over that.What we've got
to decide is what to DO.First, of course, we must order expensive
mourning all around.""I
never thought--" He stopped abruptly, his face almost purple.Bessie Blaisdell had the floor."Why, mother, I look perfectly horrid in black, you know I do," she was
wailing."And there's the Gaylords' dance just next week; and if I'm in
mourning I can't go there, nor anywhere.What's the use in having all
that money if we've got to shut ourselves up like that, and wear horrid
stuffy black, and everything?"spoke up Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness for
her.I'm sure the least we can do
in return for this wonderful gift is to show our respect and
appreciation by going into the very deepest black we can.I'm sure I'd
be glad to."Harriet had drawn her brows together in deep thought."I'm
not sure, after all, that it would be best.The letter did not say that
dear Cousin Stanley had died--he just hadn't been heard from.In that
case, I don't think we ought to do it.And it would be too bad--that
Gaylord dance is going to be the biggest thing of the season, and of
course if we WERE in black--No; on the whole, I think we won't, Bessie.Of course, in two years from now, when we get the rest, it will be
different."There's another letter to be opened in two years
from now, disposing of the rest of the property.And he was worth
millions, you know, millions!""But maybe he--er--Did it say you were to--to get those millions then?""Oh, no, it didn't SAY it, Mr.Harriet Blaisdell's smile
was a bit condescending.He just didn't give it all now because he wanted to give
himself two more years to come back in, I suppose.And, of course, if he hadn't come back by then, he would be
dead.Oh, yes, we shall get it, I'm sure."Well, I wouldn't spend them millions--till I'd got 'em,
Hattie," advised her brother-in-law dryly."I wasn't intending to, Frank," she retorted with some dignity."But
that's neither here nor there.What we're concerned with now is what to
do with what we have got.Even this will make a tremendous sensation in
Hillerton.It ought to be written up, of course, for the papers, and by
some one who knows.Why, Frank, do you
realize?We shall be rich--RICH--and all in a flash like this!I wonder
what the Pennocks will say NOW about Mellicent's not having money
enough for that precious son of theirs!Think what we can do for the
children.Think--"

"Aunt Jane, Aunt Jane, is ma here?"Wide open banged the front door as
Benny bounded down the hall.Tommy
Hooker says our great-grandfather in Africa has died an' left us a
million dollars, an' that we're richer'n Mr.Pennock or even the
Gaylords, or anybody!"Not quite, Benny, though we have been left a nice little fortune by
your cousin, Stanley G. Fulton--remember the name, dear, your cousin,
Stanley G. Fulton.And it wasn't Africa, it was South America.""And did you all get some, too?"panted Benny, looking eagerly about
him."We sure did," nodded his Uncle Frank, "all but poor Mr.Stanley G. Fulton didn't know he was a cousin, too," he
joked, with a wink in Mr.She got some, too, didn't
she?"Your Aunt Maggie is not a Blaisdell at all.She's a Duff--a very different family.""I don't care, she's just as good as a Blaisdell," cut in Mellicent;
"and she seems like one of us, anyway.""Say," he turned
valiantly to Mr.Smith, "shouldn't you think he might have given Aunt
Maggie a little of that money?""I guess he would if he'd known her!"Once more the peculiar earnestness vibrated
through Mr."But now he's dead, an' he can't.I guess if he could see Aunt Maggie
he'd wish he hadn't died 'fore he could fix her up just as good as the
rest."Smith was laughing now, but his voice was
just as emphatic, and there was a sudden flame of color in his face."Your Cousin Stanley isn't dead, my dear,--that is, we are not sure he
is dead," spoke up Benny's mother quickly."He just has not been heard
from for six months.""But he must be dead, or he'd have come back," reasoned Miss Flora,
with worried eyes; "and I, for my part, think we OUGHT to go into
mourning, too.""Of course he'd have come back," declared Mrs.Jane, "and kept the
money himself.Don't you suppose he knew what he'd written in that
letter, and don't you suppose he'd have saved those three hundred
thousand dollars if he could?"Well, anyhow, we're not going into mourning till we have to."Harriet's lips snapped together with firm decision.I'm sure I don't see any use in having the money if
we've got to wear black and not go anywhere," pouted Bessie."Are we rich, then, really, ma?""Richer 'n the Pennocks?""Well--hardly that"--her face clouded perceptibly--"that is, not until
we get the rest--in two years.""Then, if we're rich we can have everything we want, can't we?"Benny's
eyes were beginning to sparkle."I guess there'll be enough to satisfy your wants, Benny," laughed his
Uncle Frank."Then we can go back to the East Side and live just as we've a mind to,
without carin' what other folks do, can't we?""Cause if we
ARE rich we won't have ter keep tryin' ter make folks THINK we are.The rest were laughing; but Benny's mother had raised shocked
hands of protest.We shall live in a house of our own, now, of course--but it won't be on
the East Side.""And Fred'll go to college," put in Miss Flora eagerly."Yes; and I shall send Bessie to a fashionable finishing school," bowed
Mrs."Hey, Bess, you've got ter be finished," chuckled Benny.pouted Bessie, looking not altogether
pleased."Hasn't she got to be finished, too?""Mellicent hasn't got the money to be finished--yet," observed Mrs."Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do," breathed Mellicent, drawing an
ecstatic sigh."But I hope I'm going to do--just what I want to, for
once!""And I'll make you some pretty dresses that you can wear right off,
while they're in style," beamed Miss Flora.Frank Blaisdell gave a sudden laugh."But what are YOU going to do, Flo?Here you've been telling what
everybody else is going to do with the money."A blissful sigh, very like Mellicent's own, passed Miss Flora's lips."Oh, I don't know," she breathed in an awe-struck voice."It don't seem
yet--that it's really mine.""Well, 't isn't," declared Mrs."And
I, for one, am going back to work--in the kitchen, where I belong.And--Well, if here ain't Jim at last," she broke off, as her younger
brother-in-law appeared in the doorway."You're too late, pa, you're too late!"I knew they would have, Benny; and I haven't been needed, I'm
sure,--your mother's here."Harriet bridled, but did not look unpleased."But, say, Jim," breathed Miss Flora, "ain't it wonderful--ain't it
perfectly wonderful?""It is, indeed,--very wonderful," replied Mr.Jim

A Babel of eager voices arose then, but Mr.Jim's face, and trying to fathom its
expression.A little later, when the women had gone into the kitchen and Mr.Frank
had clattered back to his work downstairs, Mr.Smith thought he had the
explanation of that look on Mr.Jim and Beany were
standing over by the fireplace together."Pa, ain't you glad--about the money?""I should be, shouldn't I, my son?""But you look--so funny, and you didn't say anything, hardly."The man, with his eyes fixed on the glowing
coals in the grate, appeared not to have heard.But in a moment he
said:--

"Benny, if a poor old horse had been climbing a long, long hill all day
with the hot sun on his back, and a load that dragged and dragged at
his heels, and if he couldn't see a thing but the dust of the road that
blinded and choked him, and if he just felt that he couldn't go another
step, in spite of the whip that snapped 'Get there--get there!'all day
in his ears--how do you suppose that poor old horse would feel if
suddenly the load, and the whip, and the hill, and the dust
disappeared, and he found himself in a green pasture with the cool
gurgle of water under green trees in his ears--how do you suppose that
poor old horse would feel?""Say, he'd like it great, wouldn't he?But, pa, you didn't tell me yet
if you liked the money."The man stirred, as if waking from a trance.He threw his arm around
Benny's shoulders.Why, of course, I like it, Benny, my boy!Why, I'm going to
have time now--to get acquainted with my children!"Smith, with a sudden tightening of his throat,
slipped softly into the hall and thence to his own room.Smith,
just then, did not wish to be seen.CHAPTER X

WHAT DOES IT MATTER?The days immediately following the receipt of three remarkable letters
by the Blaisdell family were nerve-racking for all concerned.Jane's insistence that they weren't sure yet that the thing was
true, the family steadfastly refused to give out any definite
information.Even the eager Harriet yielded to Jane on this point,
acknowledging that it WOULD be mortifying, of course, if they SHOULD
talk, and nothing came of it.Their enigmatic answers to questions, and their expressive shrugs and
smiles, however, were almost as exciting as the rumors themselves; and
the Blaisdells became at once a veritable storm center of surmises and
gossip--a state of affairs not at all unpleasing to some of them, Mrs.Miss Maggie Duff, however, was not so well pleased.Smith, one
day, she freed her mind--and Miss Maggie so seldom freed her mind that
Mr."I wish," she began, "I do wish that if that Chicago lawyer is coming,
he'd come, and get done with it!Certainly the present state of affairs
is almost unbearable.""It does make it all the harder for you, to have it drag along like
this, doesn't it?""That you are not included in the bequest, I mean."Besides, as I've told
you before, there is no earthly reason why I should have been included.It's the delay, I mean, for the Blaisdells--for the whole town, for
that matter.and 'They say' is getting on
my nerves!""Why, Miss Maggie, I didn't suppose you HAD any nerves," bantered the
man."But even the gossip and the questioning aren't the worst.Between Hattie's pulling one way and Jane the other,
I feel like a bone between two quarrelsome puppies.Hattie is already
house-hunting, on the sly, and she's bought Bessie an expensive watch
and a string of gold beads.Jane, on the other hand, insists that Mr.Fulton will come back and claim the money, so she's running her house
now on the principle that she's LOST a hundred thousand dollars, and so
must economize in every possible way."I don't have to--imagine it," murmured the man.Flora, poor soul, went into a restaurant the other day and
ordered roast turkey, and now she's worrying for fear the money won't
come and justify her extravagance.Mellicent, with implicit faith that
the hundred thousand is coming wants to wear her best frocks every day.And, as if she were not already quite excited enough, young Pennock has
very obviously begun to sit up and take notice.""You don't mean he is trying to come back--so soon!""Well, he's evidently caught the glitter of the gold from afar," smiled
Miss Maggie."At all events, he's taking notice.""Doesn't see him, APPARENTLY.But she comes and tells me his every last
move (and he's making quite a number of them just now!), so I think she
does see--a little."She's just excited now, as any young girl would
be; and I'm afraid she's taking a little wicked pleasure in--not seeing
him.""But it's all bad--this delay," chafed Miss Maggie again.That's why I do wish that
lawyer would come, if he's coming.""I reckon he'll be here before long," murmured Mr.Smith, with an
elaborately casual air."But--I wish you were coming in on the deal."His kindly eyes were gazing straight into her face now."I'm a Duff, not a Blaisdell--except when they want--" She bit her lip."I mean, I'm not a Blaisdell at all,"
she finished hastily."You're not a Blaisdell--except when they want something of you!""Oh PLEASE, I didn't mean to say--I DIDN'T say--THAT," cried Miss
Maggie, in very genuine distress."No, I know you didn't, but I did," flared the man."Miss Maggie, it's
a downright shame--the way they impose on you sometimes."I like to have them--I mean, I like to do what I can for
them," she corrected hastily, laughing in spite of herself."You like to get all tired out, I suppose.""And it doesn't matter, anyway, of course," he gibed.Smith was still sitting erect, still
speaking with grim terseness."But let me tell you right here and now
that I don't approve of that doctrine of yours.""That 'It-doesn't-matter' doctrine of yours.I tell you it's very
pernicious--very!"Oh, well--it doesn't matter--if
you don't."He caught the twinkle in her eyes and threw up his hands despairingly.With a sudden businesslike air of determination Miss Maggie faced him."Just what is the matter with that doctrine, please, and what do you
mean?""I mean that things DO matter, and that we merely shut our eyes to the
real facts in the case when we say that they don't.War, death, sin,
evil--the world is full of them, and they do matter."I never say 'It doesn't matter' to war, or
death, or sin, or evil.But there are other things--"

"But the other things matter, too," interrupted the man irritably."Right here and now it matters that you don't share in the money; it
matters that you slave half your time for a father who doesn't anywhere
near appreciate you; it matters that you slave the rest of the time for
every Tom and Dick and Harry and Jane and Mehitable in Hillerton that
has run a sliver under a thumb, either literally or metaphorically.It
matters that--"

But Miss Maggie was laughing merrily.Smith, you
don't know what you are saying!"It's YOU who don't know what you are saying!""But, pray, what would you have me say?""I'd have you say it DOES matter, and I'd have you insist on having
your rights, every time."The man fell back, so sudden and so astounding was the change that had
come to the woman opposite him.She was leaning forward in her chair,
her lips trembling, her eyes a smouldering flame."What if I had insisted on my rights, all the way up?""Would I have come home that first time from college?Would I have
stepped into Mother Blaisdell's shoes and kept the house?Would I have
swept and baked and washed and ironed, day in and day out, to make a
home for father and for Jim and Frank and Flora?Would I have come back
again and again, when my beloved books were calling, calling, always
calling?Would I have seen other girls love and marry and go to homes
of their own, while I--Oh, what am I saying, what am I saying?"she
choked, covering her eyes with the back of her hand, and turning her
face away."Please, if you can, forget what I said.Indeed, I
NEVER--broke out like that--before.Smith, on his feet, was trying to
work off his agitation by tramping up and down the small room."But I am ashamed," moaned Miss Maggie, her face still averted."And I
can't think why I should have been so--so wild.It was just something
that you said--about my rights, I think.You see--all my life I've just
HAD to learn to say 'It doesn't matter,' when there were so many things
I wanted to do, and couldn't.And--don't you see?--I found out, after a
while, that it didn't really matter, half so much--college and my own
little wants and wishes as that I should do--what I had to do,
willingly and pleasantly at home.""But, good Heavens, how could you keep from tearing 'round and throwing
things?"I--I smashed a bowl once, and two cups."She
laughed shamefacedly, and met his eyes now."But I soon found--that it
didn't make me or anybody else--any happier, and that it didn't help
things at all.So I tried--to do the other way.And now, please, PLEASE
say you'll forget all this--what I've been saying.Smith turned on his heel and marched up and down the
room again.Stanley G. Fulton, if you must know, for not giving you any of
that money."Miss Maggie threw out both her hands with a
gesture of repulsion."If I've heard that word once, I've heard it a
hundred times in the last week.Sometimes I wish I might never hear it
again.""You don't want to be deaf, do you?Well, you'd have to be, to escape
hearing that word."But--" again she threw out her hands."Don't you WANT--money, really?"We have to have money, too; but
I don't think it's--everything in the world, by any means.""You don't think it brings happiness, then?""Most of--er--us would be willing to take the risk.""Now, in the case of the Blaisdells here--don't you think this money is
going to bring happiness to them?"Smith, with a concern all out of
proportion to his supposed interest in the matter, "you don't mean to
say you DON'T think this money is going to bring them happiness!"This money'll bring them happiness all right, of
course,--particularly to some of them.But I was just wondering; if you
don't know how to spend five dollars so as to get the most out of it,
how will you spend five hundred, or five hundred thousand--and get the
most out of that?"CHAPTER XI

SANTA CLAUS ARRIVES


It was not long after this that Mr.Smith found a tall, gray-haired
man, with keen gray eyes, talking with Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and
Mellicent in the front room over the grocery store.Smith, a joyful light of recognition in his eyes.Then suddenly he stooped and picked up something from the floor.When
he came upright his face was very red.He did not look at the tall,
gray-haired man again as he advanced into the room.Smith, it's the lawyer--he's come.Jane Blaisdell to the
keen-eyed man, who, also, for no apparent reason, had grown very red.Smith's a Blaisdell, too,--distant, you know.He's doing a
Blaisdell book."The lawyer smiled
and held out his hand, but there was an odd constraint in his manner."So you're a Blaisdell, too, are you?"Smith, smiling straight into the lawyer's eyes."But not near enough to come in on the money, of course," explained
Mrs."He isn't a Hiller-Blaisdell.He's just boarding here, while
he writes his book.So he isn't near enough to come in--on the money."This time
it was the lawyer who was smiling straight into Mr.A sudden question from Mellicent seemed
to freeze the smile on his lips.Norton, please, what was Mr."Why--er--you must have seen his pictures in the papers," stammered the
lawyer.Smith with a bland
smile, as he seated himself."Why--er--" The lawyer came to a still more unhappy pause."Of course, we've seen his pictures," broke in Mellicent, "but those
don't tell us anything.So won't you tell us what he
was like, please, while we're waiting for father to come up?Was he
nice and jolly, or was he stiff and haughty?Smith, for some
reason, seemed to be highly amused.Oh, just an ordinary man, you know,--somewhat conceited, of
course."(A queer little half-gasp came from Mr.Smith, but the lawyer
was not looking at Mr."Eccentric--you've heard that, probably.And he HAS done crazy things, and no mistake.Of course, with his money
and position, we won't exactly say he had bats in his belfry--isn't
that what they call it?--but--"

Mr.Smith gave a real gasp this time, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell
ejaculated:--

"There, I told you so!And now he'll come
back and claim the money.And if we've gone and
spent any of it--" A gesture of despair finished her sentence."Give yourself no uneasiness on that score, madam," the lawyer assured
her gravely."I think I can safely guarantee he will not do that.""I did not say that, madam.I said I was very sure he would not come
back and claim this money that is to be paid over to your husband and
his brother and sister.Dead or alive, he has no further power over
that money now."Smith says we've probably got to pay a tax on it," thrust in
Mrs."Do you know how much we'll HAVE to pay?And isn't there any way we can save doing that?"Norton could answer, a heavy step down the hall heralded Mr.Frank Blaisdell's advance, and in the ensuing confusion of his arrival,
Mr.As he passed the lawyer, however, Mellicent
thought she heard him mutter, "You rascal!"But afterwards she
concluded she must have been mistaken, for the two men appeared to
become at once the best of friends.Norton remained in town several
days, and frequently she saw him and Mr.Smith chatting pleasantly
together, or starting off apparently for a walk.Mellicent was very
sure, therefore, that she must have been mistaken in thinking she had
heard Mr.Smith utter so remarkable an exclamation as he left the room
that first day.Norton in Hillerton, and for some days
afterward, the Blaisdells were too absorbed in the mere details of
acquiring and temporarily investing their wealth to pay attention to
anything else.Robert Chalmers,
and the heads of two other Hillerton banks, the three legatees set
themselves to the task of "finding a place to put it," as Miss Flora
breathlessly termed it.Hattie said that, for her part, she should like to leave their
share all in the bank: then she'd have it to spend whenever she wanted
it.She yielded to the shocked protestations of the others, however,
and finally consented that her husband should invest a large part of it
in the bonds he so wanted, leaving a generous sum in the bank in her
own name.She was assured that the bonds were just as good as money,
anyway, as they were the kind that were readily convertible into cash.Jane, when she understood the matter, was for investing every cent
of theirs where it would draw the largest interest possible.Jane
had never before known very much about interest, and she was fascinated
with its delightful possibilities.She spent whole days joyfully
figuring percentages, and was awakened from her happy absorption only
by the unpleasant realization that her husband was not in sympathy with
her ideas at all.He said that the money was his, not hers, and that,
for once in his life, he was going to have his way."His way" in this
case proved to be the prompt buying-out of the competing grocery on the
other corner, and the establishing of good-sized bank account.The rest
of the money he said Jane might invest for a hundred per cent, if she
wanted to.Jane was pleased to this extent, and asked if it were possible that she
could get such a splendid rate as one hundred per cent.She was not so pleased later, when Mr.Norton and the
bankers told her what she COULD get--with safety; and she was very
angry because they finally appealed to her husband and she was obliged
to content herself with a paltry five or six per cent, when there were
such lovely mining stocks and oil wells everywhere that would pay so
much more.She told Flora that she ought to thank her stars that SHE had the money
herself in her own name, to do just as she pleased with, without any
old-fogy men bossing her.But Flora only shivered and said "Mercy me!"and that, for her part,
she wished she didn't have to say what to do with it.She was scared
of her life of it, anyway, and she was just sure she should lose it,
whatever she did with it; and she'most wished she didn't have it, only
it would be nice, of course, to buy things with it--and she supposed
she would buy things with it, after a while, when she got used to it,
and was not afraid to spend it.Miss Flora was, indeed, quite breathless most of the time, these days.She tried very hard to give the kind gentlemen who were helping her no
trouble, and she showed herself eager always to take their advice.But
she wished they would not ask her opinion; she was always afraid to
give it, and she didn't have one, anyway; only she did worry, of
course, and she had to ask them sometimes if they were real sure the
places they had put her money were perfectly safe, and just couldn't
blow up.It was so comforting always to see them smile, and hear them
say: "Perfectly, my dear Miss Flora, perfectly!To be sure, one day, the big fat man, not Mr.Chalmers,
did snap out: "No, madam; only the Lord Almighty can guarantee a
government bond--the whole country may be blown to atoms by a volcano
to-morrow morning!"She was startled, terribly startled; but she saw at once, of course,
that it must be just his way of joking, for of course there wasn't any
volcano big enough to blow up the whole United States; and, anyway, she
did not think it was nice of him, and it was almost like swearing, to
say "the Lord Almighty" in that tone of voice.Chalmers, or to the
other man with a wart on his nose.Miss Flora had never had a check-book before, but she tried very hard
to learn how to use it, and to show herself not too stupid.She was
glad there were such a lot of checks in the book, but she didn't
believe she'd ever spend them all--such a lot of money!She had had a
savings-bank book, to be sure, but she not been able to put anything in
the bank for a long time, and she had been worrying a good deal lately
for fear she would have to draw some out, business had been so dull.But she would not have to do that now, of course, with all this money
that had come to her.They told her that she could have all the money she wanted by just
filling out one of the little slips in her check-book the way they had
told her to do it and taking it to Mr.Chalmers's bank--that there were
a good many thousand dollars there waiting for her to spend, just as
she liked; and that, when they were gone, Mr.Chalmers would tell her
how to sell some of her bonds and get more.There were other things, too, that they had told her--too many for her
to remember--something about interest, and things called coupons that
must be cut off the bonds at certain times.She tried to remember it
all; but Mr.Chalmers had been very kind and had told her not to fret.Meanwhile, he had rented her a
nice tin box (that pulled out like a drawer) in the safety-deposit
vault under the bank, where she could keep her bonds and all the other
papers--such a lot of them!--that Mr.Chalmers told her she must keep
very carefully.But it was all so new and complicated, and everybody was always talking
at once, so!No wonder, indeed, that Miss Flora was quite breathless with it all.By the time the Blaisdells found themselves able to pay attention to
Hillerton, or to anything outside their own astounding personal
affairs, they became suddenly aware of the attention Hillerton was
paying to THEM.The grocery store, the residence of Frank
Blaisdell, and Miss Flora's humble cottage might be found at nearly any
daylight hour with from one to a dozen curious-eyed gazers on the
sidewalk before them.The town paper had contained an elaborate account
of the bequest and the remarkable circumstances attending it; and
Hillerton became the Mecca of wandering automobiles for miles around.Big metropolitan dailies got wind of the affair, recognized the magic
name of Stanley G. Fulton, and sent reporters post-haste to Hillerton.Speculation as to whether the multi-millionaire was really dead was
prevalent everywhere, and a search for some clue to his reported South
American exploring expedition was undertaken in several quarters.Various rumors concerning the expedition appeared immediately, but none
of them seemed to have any really solid foundation.Interviews with the
great law firm having the handling of Mr.Fulton's affairs were
printed, but even here little could be learned save the mere fact of
the letter of instructions, upon which they had acted according to
directions, and the other fact that there still remained one more
packet--understood to be the last will and testament--to be opened in
two years' time if Mr.The lawyers were
bland and courteous, but they really had nothing to say, they declared,
beyond the already published facts.In Hillerton the Blaisdells accepted this notoriety with characteristic
variation.Miss Flora, after cordially welcoming one "nice young man,"
and telling him all about how strange and wonderful it was, and how
frightened she felt, was so shocked and distressed to find all that she
said (and a great deal that she did not say!)staring at her from the
first page of a big newspaper, that she forthwith barred her doors, and
refused to open them till she satisfied herself, by surreptitious peeps
through the blinds, that it was only a neighbor who was knocking for
admittance.An offer of marriage from a Western ranchman and another
from a Vermont farmer (both entire strangers) did not tend to lessen
her perturbation of mind.Frank, at the grocery store, rather welcomed questioners--so long as
there was a hope of turning them into customers; but his wife and
Mellicent showed almost as much terror of them as did Miss Flora
herself.James Blaisdell and Fred stoically endured such as refused to be
silenced by their brusque non-committalism.Benny, at first welcoming
everything with the enthusiasm he would accord to a circus, soon
sniffed his disdain, as at a show that had gone stale.Hattie was the only one that found in it any
real joy and comfort.Even Bessie, excited and interested as she was,
failed to respond with quite the enthusiasm that her mother showed.Hattie saw every reporter, talked freely of "dear Cousin Stanley"
and his wonderful generosity, and explained that she would go into
mourning, of course, if she knew he was really dead.She sat for two
new portraits for newspaper use, besides graciously posing for staff
photographers whenever requested to do so; and she treasured carefully
every scrap of the printed interviews or references to the affair that
she could find.She talked with the townspeople, also, and told Al
Smith how fine it was that he could have something really worth while
for his book.Smith, these days, was keeping rather closely to his work,
especially when reporters were in evidence.He had been heard to
remark, indeed, that he had no use for reporters.Certainly he fought
shy of those investigating the Fulton-Blaisdell legacy.He read the
newspaper accounts, though, most attentively, particularly the ones
from Chicago that Mr.It was in one
of these papers that he found this paragraph:--

There seems to be really nothing more that can be learned about the
extraordinary Stanley G. Fulton-Blaisdell affair.The bequests have
been paid, the Blaisdells are reveling in their new wealth, and Mr.There is nothing now to do but to await
the opening of the second mysterious packet two years hence.This, it
is understood, is the final disposition of his estate; and if he is
really dead, such will doubtless prove to be the case.There are those,
however, who, remembering the multi-millionaire's well-known
eccentricities, are suspecting him of living in quiet retirement
somewhere, laughing in his sleeve at the tempest in the teapot that he
has created; and that long before the two years are up, he will be back
on Chicago's streets, debonair and smiling as ever.The fact that so
little can be found in regard to the South American exploring
expedition might give color to this suspicion; but where on this
terrestrial ball could Mr.Stanley G. Fulton find a place to live in
UNREPORTED retirement?Smith did not show this paragraph to the Blaisdells.He destroyed
the paper containing it, indeed, promptly and effectually--with a
furtive glance over his shoulder as he did so.It was at about this
time, too, that Mr.Smith began to complain of his eyes and to wear
smoked glasses.Smith," said Benny, the first time he saw
him."Why, I didn't hardly know you!"Smith, with suddenly a beaming
countenance."Oh, well, that doesn't matter, does it?"Smith
gave an odd little chuckle as he turned away.CHAPTER XII

THE TOYS RATTLE OUT


Early in December Mrs.Hattie, after an extended search, found a
satisfactory home.It was a somewhat pretentious house, not far from
the Gaylord place.Hattie had it repapered and repainted
throughout and two new bathrooms put in.(She said that everybody who
was anybody always had lots of bathrooms.)Then she set herself to
furnishing it.She said that, of course, very little of their old
furniture would do at all.She was talking to Maggie Duff about it one
day when Mr.She was radiant that afternoon
in a handsome silk dress and a new fur coat."You're looking very well--and happy, Mrs."I am well, and I'm perfectly happy, Mr.You know about the new home, of course.Well, it's all
ready, and I'm ordering the furnishings.Oh, you don't know what it
means to me to be able at last to surround myself with all the
beautiful things I've so longed for all my life!""I'm very glad, I'm sure."Smith said the words as if he meant them."Yes, of course; and poor Maggie here, she says she's glad, too,--though
I don't see how she can be, when she never got a cent, do you, Mr.But, poor Maggie, she's got so used to being left out--"

"Hush, hush!""You'll find money isn't everything in this world, Hattie Blaisdell,"
growled Mr.Duff, who, to-day, for some unknown reason, had deserted
the kitchen cookstove for the living-room base-burner."And when I see
what a little money does for some folks I'm glad I'm poor.I wouldn't
be rich if I could.Furthermore, I'll thank you to keep your sympathy
at home."Why, Father Duff," bridled Mrs.Hattie indignantly, "you know how poor
Maggie has had to--"

"Er--but tell us about the new home," interrupted Mr.Smith quickly,
"and the fine new furnishings.""Why, there isn't much to tell yet--about the furnishings, I mean.But I can tell you what I'm GOING to have."Hattie settled herself more comfortably, and began to look happy again."As I was saying to Maggie, when you came in, I shall get almost
everything new--for the rooms that show, I mean,--for, of course, my
old things won't do at all.I want
oil paintings, of course, in gilt frames."She glanced a little
disdainfully at the oak-framed prints on Miss Maggie's walls."Going in for old masters, maybe," suggested Mr.Duff, with a sarcasm
that fell pointless at Mrs."I'm going to have anything
old in my house--where it can be seen--For once I'm going to have NEW
things--all new things.You have to make a show or you won't be
recognized by the best people.""But, Hattie, my dear," began Miss Maggie, flushing a little, and
carefully avoiding Mr.Smith's eyes, "old masters are--are very
valuable, and--"

"I don't care if they are," retorted Mrs."If
they're old, I don't want them, and that settles it.I'm going to have
velvet carpets and the handsomest lace curtains that I can find; and
I'm going to have some of those gold chairs, like the Pennocks have,
only nicer.Theirs are awfully dull, some of them.And I'm going to
buy--"

"Humph!Pity you can't buy a little common sense--somewhere!"snarled
old man Duff, getting stiffly to his feet."You'll need it, to swing
all that style.""Oh, I don't mind what Father Duff says," laughed Mrs.But
there was a haughty tilt to her chin and an angry sparkle in her eyes
as she, too, arose."I'm just going, anyway, so you don't need to
disturb yourself, Father Duff."But Father Duff, with another "Humph!"and a muttered something about
having all he wanted already of "silly chatter," stamped out into the
kitchen, with the usual emphasis of his cane at every other step.It was just as well, perhaps, that he went, for Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell
had been gone barely five minutes when her sister-in-law, Mrs."I've come to see you about a very important matter, Maggie," she
announced, as she threw off her furs--not new ones--and unbuttoned her
coat--which also was not new."Then certainly I will take myself out of the way," said Mr.Smith,
with a smile, making a move to go."Part of it
concerns you, and I'm glad you're here, anyway.I'm afraid I shall have to give up boarding you, and one thing I
came to-day for was to ask Maggie if she'd take you.I wanted to give
poor Maggie the first chance at you, of course."Smith laughed,--but unmistakably he blushed."The
first--But, my dear woman, it is just possible that Miss Maggie may
wish to--er--decline this great honor which is being conferred upon
her, and she may hesitate, for the sake of my feelings, to do it before
me.NOW I'm very sure I ought to have left at once."(Was Miss Maggie blushing the least bit, too?)"I shall be
very glad to take Mr.Smith as a boarder if he wants to come--but HE'S
got something to say about it, remember.But tell me, why are you
letting him go, Jane?""Now this surely WILL be embarrassing," laughed
Mr."Do I eat too much, or am I merely noisy,
and a nuisance generally?"She was looking at Miss
Maggie, her eyes somber, intent.She says it's perfectly absurd for me to take boarders, with all
our money; and she's making a terrible fuss about where we live.She
says she's ashamed--positively ashamed of us--that we haven't moved
into a decent place yet."Miss Maggie's lips puckered a little."Y-yes, only it will cost so much.I've always wanted a house--with a
yard, I mean; and 'twould be nice for Mellicent, of course.""Y-yes, I know I have; but it'll cost so much, Maggie.It costs not only the money itself, but all the interest that the money
could be earning.Why, Maggie, I never saw anything like it."Her face
grew suddenly alert and happy."I never knew before how much money,
just MONEY, could earn, while you didn't have to do a thing but sit
back and watch it do it.It's the most fascinating thing I ever saw.I
counted up the other day how much we'd have if we didn't spend a cent
of it for ten years--the legacy, I mean.""Aren't you going to
spend any of that money before ten years' time?"The anxious frown came again to her
face.We have spent a lot of it, already.Frank has
bought out that horrid grocery across the street, and he's put a lot in
the bank, and he spends from that every day, I know.And I'm WILLING to
spend some, of course.But we had to pay so much inheritance tax and
all that it would be my way not to spend much till the interest had
sort of made that up, you know; but Frank and Mellicent--they won't
hear to it a minute.They want to move, too, and they're teasing me all
the time to get new clothes, both for me and for her.I can't do a thing with Hattie.You say yourself you'd like to," answered Miss Maggie
promptly.Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands into his pockets as
he took a nervous turn about the room, before he spoke."Good Heavens, woman, that money was given you to--that is, it was
probably given you to use."But I am using it," argued Mrs."I think I'm making
the very best possible use of it when I put it where it will earn more.Besides, what does the Bible say about that man with one
talent that didn't make it earn more?"Smith turned on his heel and renewed his march."I think the only thing money is good for is to exchange it for
something you want," observed Miss Maggie sententiously.She gazed at Miss Maggie with
fondly reproving eyes."Yes, we all know your ideas of money, Maggie.You're very sweet and
dear, and we love you; but you ARE extravagant."You use everything you have every day; and you never protect a
thing.Actually, I don't believe there's a tidy or a linen slip in this
house."Smith breathe a fervent "Thank the Lord!""And that brings me right up to something else I was going
to say.I want you to know that I'm going to help you."Miss Maggie looked distressed and raised a protesting hand; but Mrs.Jane smilingly shook her head and went on.I always said I should, if I had money, and I shall--though
I must confess that I'd have a good deal more heart to do it if you
weren't quite so extravagant.But again she only smilingly shook her head and continued speaking."And if we move, I'm going to give you the parlor carpet, and some rugs
to protect it.""Thank you; but, really, I don't want the parlor carpet," refused Miss
Maggie, a tiny smouldering fire in her eyes."And I shall give you some money, too," smiled Mrs.Jane, very
graciously,--"when the interest begins to come in, you know.It's too bad you should have nothing while I
have so much."The smouldering fire in Miss Maggie's eyes had become a
flame now."Nonsense, Maggie, you mustn't be so proud.Wasn't I poor just the other day?However, since it distresses you so,
we won't say any more about it now.Then, you advise me--you both advise me--to move, do you?""I do, most certainly," bowed Miss Maggie, still with a trace of
constraint."For Heaven's sake, lady, go home, and spend--some of that money!""Well, I don't see but what I shall have to, with everybody against me
like this," she sighed, getting slowly to her feet."But if you
knew--if either of you knew--how really valuable money is, and how much
it would earn for you, if you'd only let it, I don't believe you'd be
quite so fast to tell me to go and spend it.""Perhaps not; but then, you see, we don't know," smiled Miss Maggie,
once again her cheery self.Smith faced Miss Maggie with a quizzical
smile."You mean--"

"I'm awaiting orders--as your new boarder."They'll not be alarming, I assure you.And I think it's mighty good of you to take me.But--SHOULD you, do you think?Haven't you got enough, with your father
to care for?Won't it be too hard for you?"Annabelle and Florence
Martin, a farmer's daughters are very anxious to be in town to attend
school this winter, and I have said that I would take them."I can imagine how much work you'll let them do!It strikes me the
'help' is on the other foot.I shall be
glad enough to come, and I'll stay--unless I find you're doing too much
and going beyond your strength.I'll arrange that he proposes the idea himself.Besides,"--she twinkled merrily--"you really get along wonderfully with
father, you know.And, as for the work--I shall have more time now:
Hattie will have some one else to care for her headaches, and Jane
won't put down any more carpets, I fancy, for a while.""Honestly, Miss Maggie, one of the
best things about this Blaisdell money, in my eyes, is that it may give
you a little rest from being chief cook and bottle washer and head
nurse combined, on tap for any minute.But, say, that woman WILL spend
some of that money, won't she?"I saw Frank last evening--though I didn't think it
necessary to say so to her.I think you'll find that
they move very soon, and that the ladies of the family have some new
clothes."Er--ah--well, I am," he asserted stoutly."Such a windfall
of wealth ought to bring happiness, I think; and it seemed to, to Mrs.Hattie, though, of course, she'll learn better, as time goes on how to
spend her money.Jane--And, by the way, how is Miss Flora
bearing up--under the burden?"And do I hear 'Poor Maggie' say 'Poor Flora'?""Oh, she won't be 'poor' long," smiled Miss Maggie."She'll get used to
it--this stupendous sum of money--one of these days.But just now she's
nearly frightened to death.""Yes-both because she's got it, and because she's afraid she'll lose
it.That doesn't sound logical, I know, but Flora isn't being logical
just now.To begin with, she hasn't the least idea how to spend money.Under my careful guidance, however, she has bought her a few new
dresses--though they're dead black--"

"Black!""Yes, she's put on mourning," smiled Miss Maggie, as he came to a
dismayed stop.She declared she wouldn't feel half
decent unless she did, with that poor man dead, and giving her all that
money.""But he isn't dead--that is, they aren't sure he's dead," amended Mr.She says he must be, or he would have appeared
in time to save all that money.She's very much shocked, especially at
Hattie, that there is so little respect being shown his memory.So she
is all the more determined to do the best she can on her part.""But she--she didn't know him, so she can't--er--really MOURN for him,"
stammered the man.There was a most curious helplessness on Mr."No, she says she can't really mourn," smiled Miss Maggie again, "and
that's what worries her the most of anything--because she CAN'T mourn,
and when he's been so good to her--and he with neither wife nor chick
nor child TO mourn for him, she says.But she's determined to go
through the outward form of it, at least.So she's made herself some
new black dresses, and she's bought a veil.Fulton's
picture (she had one cut from a magazine, I believe), and has had it
framed and, hung on her wall.On the mantel beneath it she keeps fresh
flowers always.She says it's the nearest she can come to putting
flowers on his grave, poor man!""And she doesn't go anywhere, except to church, and for necessary
errands.""That explains why I haven't seen her.I've
persuaded her to do that.She'll go with a party, of course,--one of
those 'personally conducted' affairs, you know.All her life she's wanted to see Niagara.Now she's going, and
she can hardly believe it's true.She wants a phonograph, too, but
she's decided not to get that until after six months' mourning is
up--it's too frivolous and jolly for a house of mourning.""It is funny, isn't it, that she takes it quite so seriously?Bessie
suggested (I'm afraid Bessie was a little naughty!)that she get the
phonograph, but not allow it to play anything but dirges and hymn
tunes.""But isn't the woman going to take ANY comfort with that money?"Smith,
what it means to her, to feel that she need never want again, and that
she can buy whatever she pleases, without thinking of the cost.That's
why she's frightened--because she IS so happy.She thinks it can't be
right to be so happy.When she isn't
being frightened about that, she's being frightened for fear she'll
lose it, and thus not have it any more.I don't think she quite
realizes yet what a big sum of money it is, and that she'd have to lose
a great deal before she lost it all.""Oh, well, she'll get used to that, in time.They'll all get used to
it--in time," declared Mr."Then
they'll begin to live sanely and sensibly, and spend the money as it
should be spent.Of course, you couldn't expect them to know what to
do, at the very first, with a sum like that dropped into their laps.Smith, his face suddenly alert and interested again."What would you do
if you should fall heir to a hundred thousand dollars--to-morrow?"Her eyes became luminous, unfathomable."There is so much that a hundred thousand dollars could do--so much!Why, I would--" Her face changed again abruptly.She sniffed as at an
odor from somewhere.Then lightly she sprang to her feet and crossed to
the stove."What would I do with a hundred thousand dollars?"she
demanded, whisking open a damper in the pipe."I'd buy a new
base-burner that didn't leak gas!That's what I'd do with a hundred
thousand dollars.I wasn't thinking of charging quite that for your board.But you seemed so interested, I didn't know but what you were going to
hand over the hundred thousand, just to see what I would do with it,"
she challenged mischievously."However, I'll stop talking nonsense, and
come down to business.New Boarder, I'll
let you choose which of two rooms you'd like."But, as had occurred once or twice before, Mr.Smith's face, as he followed her, was a study.CHAPTER XIII

THE DANCING BEGINS


Christmas saw many changes in the Blaisdell families.The James Blaisdells had moved into the big house near the Gaylord
place.Hattie had installed two maids in the kitchen, bought a
handsome touring car, and engaged an imposing-looking chauffeur.Fred
had entered college, and Bessie had been sent to a fashionable school
on the Hudson.Benny, to his disgust, had also been sent away to an
expensive school.Christmas, however, found them all at home for the
holidays, and for the big housewarming that their parents were planning
to give on Christmas night.The Frank Blaisdells had also moved.They were occupying a new house
not too far from the grocery store.Jane said that she wished to live in it awhile, so as to be sure she
would really like it.Besides, it would save the interest on the money
for that much time, anyway.True, she had been a little disturbed when
her husband reminded her that they would be paying rent meanwhile.But
she said that didn't matter; she was not going to put all that money
into a house just yet, anyway,--not till she was sure it was the best
they could do for the price.They, too, were planning a housewarming.Theirs was to come the night
after Christmas.Jane told her husband that they should not want
theirs the same night, of course, as Hattie's, and that if she had hers
right away the next night, she could eat up any of the cakes or ice
cream that was left from Hattie's party, and thus save buying so much
new for herself.But her husband was so indignant over the idea of
eating "Hattie's leavings" that she had to give up this part of her
plan, though she still arranged to have her housewarming on the day
following her sister-in-law's.Mellicent, like Bessie, was home from school, though not from the same
school.Jane had found another one that was just as good as
Bessie's, she said, and which did not cost near so much money.Smith was not living with them now, of course.He was boarding at Miss
Maggie Duff's.Miss Flora was living in the same little rented cottage she had
occupied for many years.She said that she should move, of course, when
she got through her mourning, but, until then she thought it more
suitable for her to stay where she was.She had what she wanted to eat,
now, however, and she did not do dressmaking any longer.She still did
her own housework, in spite of Harriet Blaisdell's insistence that she
get a maid.She said that there was plenty of time for all those things
when she had finished her mourning.She went out very little, though
she did go to the housewarming at her brother James's--"being a
relative, so," she decided that no criticism could be made.It seemed as if all Hillerton went to that house-warming.Those who
were not especially invited to attend went as far as the street or the
gate, and looked on enviously.Hattie had been very generous with
her invitations, however.She said that she had asked everybody who
ever pretended to go anywhere.She told Maggie Duff that, of course,
after this, she should be more exclusive--very exclusive, in fact; but
that this time Jim wanted to ask everybody, and she didn't mind so
much--she was really rather glad to have all these people see the
house, and all--they certainly never would have the chance again.Hattie had very kindly
included him in the invitation.She had asked Father Duff, too,
especially, though she said she knew, of course, that he would not
go--he never went anywhere.Father Duff bristled up at this, and
declared that he guessed he would go, after all, just to show them that
he could, if he wanted to.Hattie grew actually pale, but Miss
Maggie exclaimed joyfully that, of course, he would go--he ought to go,
to show proper respect!Father Duff said no then, very decidedly; that
nothing could hire him to go, and that he had no respect to show.He
declared that he had no use for gossip and gabble and unwholesome
eating; and he said that he should not think Maggie would care to go,
either,--unless she could be in the kitchen, where it would seem
natural to her!Hattie, however, smiled kindly, and said, of course, now she could
afford to hire better help than Maggie (caterers from the city and all
that), so Maggie would not have to be in the kitchen, and that with
practice she would soon learn not to mind at all being 'round among
folks in the parlor.Father Duff had become so apoplectically angry at this that Mr.Smith,
who chanced to be present, and who also was very angry, was forced to
forget his own wrath in his desire to make the situation easier for
Miss Maggie.He had not supposed that Miss Maggie would go at all, after that.He
had even determined not to go himself.But Miss Maggie, after a day's
thought, had laughed and had said, with her eyes twinkling: "Oh, well,
it doesn't matter, you know,--it doesn't REALLY matter, does it?"He saw almost
everybody he knew in Hillerton, and many that he did not know.He heard
the Blaisdells and their new wealth discussed from all viewpoints, and
he heard some things about the missing millionaire benefactor that were
particularly interesting--to him.The general opinion seemed to be that
the man was dead; though a few admitted that there was a possibility,
of course, that he was merely lost somewhere in darkest South America
and would eventually get back to civilization, certainly long before
the time came to open the second letter of instructions.Many professed
to know the man well, through magazine and newspaper accounts (there
were times when Mr.Smith adjusted more carefully the smoked glasses
which he was still wearing); and some had much to say of the
millionaire's characteristics, habits, and eccentricities; all of which
Mr.Then, too, there were the Blaisdells themselves.They were all there,
even to Miss Flora, who was in dead black; and Mr.Miss Flora told him that she was so happy she could not sleep nights,
but that she was rather glad she couldn't sleep, after all, for she
spent the time mourning for poor Mr.Fulton, and thinking how good he
had been to her.And THAT made it seem as if she was doing SOMETHING
for him.She said, Yes, oh, yes, she was going to stop black mourning
in six months, and go into grays and lavenders; and she was glad Mr.Smith thought that was long enough, quite long enough for the black,
but she could not think for a moment of putting on colors now, as he
suggested.She said, too, that she had decided not to go to Niagara for
the present.And when he demurred at this, she told him that really she
would rather not.It would be warmer in the spring, and she would much
rather wait till she could enjoy every minute without feeling
that--well, that she was almost dancing over the poor man's grave, as
it were.He turned away, indeed, rather
precipitately--so precipitately that Miss Flora wondered if she could
have said anything to offend him.Her dress was new, and in good style,
yet she in some way looked odd to Mr.In a moment he knew the
reason: she wore no apron.Smith had never seen her without an
apron before.Even on the street she wore a black silk one.He
complimented her gallantly on her fine appearance.Thank you, of course," she answered worriedly."But it
cost an awful lot--this dress did; but Frank and Mellicent would have
it.That child!--have you seen her to-night?"She, too is looking most
charming, Mrs."Yes, I know she is--and some other folks so, too, I notice."Well, she will be, if she isn't now."But I thought--that was broken up."YOU know what that woman said--the insult!But now, since this
money came--" She let an expressive gesture complete the sentence.I don't think he'll make much
headway--now.""Indeed, he won't--if I can help myself!""I reckon he won't stand much show with Miss Mellicent--after what's
happened.""I guess he won't," snapped the woman."He isn't worth half what SHE is
now.As if I'd let her look at HIM!"There was an odd expression
on his face.Smith, I don't know what I am going to do--with
Mellicent," she sighed.She's as wild as a hawk and as--as flighty as a humming-bird,
since this money came.Smith, looking suddenly very happy
himself."Youth is the time for joy and laughter; and I'm sure I'm glad
she is taking a little pleasure in life."Smith, you know as well as I do that life isn't all pink
dresses and sugar-plums.It is a serious business, and I have tried to
bring her up to understand it.I have taught her to be thrifty and
economical, and to realize the value of a dollar.But now--she doesn't
SEE a dollar but what she wants to spend it."You aren't sorry--the money came?"Smith was eyeing her with a
quizzical smile.Blaisdell's answer was promptly emphatic."And I hope I shall be found worthy of the gift, and able to handle it
wisely.""Er-ah--you mean--" Mr."I mean that I regard wealth as one of the greatest of trusts, to be
wisely administered, Mr."That is why it distresses me so to see my daughter so carried away
with the mere idea of spending.I thought I'd taught her differently,"
sighed the woman.He found her
in the music-room, which had been cleared for dancing.She was
surrounded by four young men.One held her fan, one carried her white
scarf on his arm, a third was handing her a glass of water.The fourth
was apparently writing his name on her dance card.The one writing on the
dance programme he knew was young Hibbard Gaylord.Leaning against a window-casing
near by, he watched the kaleidoscopic throng, bestowing a not too
conspicuous attention upon the group about Miss Mellicent Blaisdell.Mellicent was the picture of radiant loveliness.The rose in her cheeks
matched the rose of her gown, and her eyes sparkled with happiness.Smith could see, she dispensed her favors with rare
impartiality; though, as he came toward them finally, he realized at
once that there was a merry wrangle of some sort afoot.He had not
quite reached them when, to his surprise, Mellicent turned to him in
very evident relief."I'm going to sit it out
with him.I shan't dance it with either of you."protested young Gaylord and Carl Pennock abjectly.If you WILL both write your names down for the same dance, it is
nothing more than you ought to expect."Mellicent shook her head again merrily."I shan't be satisfied with anything--but to sit it out with Mr.Smith," she bowed, as she took his promptly offered arm.Smith bore her away followed by the despairing groans of the
two disappointed youths and the taunting gibes of their companions.Oh, I'm so glad you came," sighed Mellicent."And it looked like a real rescue, too.""Wasn't one of them young Pennock?""Oh, yes, he's come back.I wonder if he thinks I don't know--WHY!"She shrugged her shoulders with a demure dropping of her eyes."Oh, I let him come back--to a certain extent.I shouldn't want him to
think I cared or noticed enough to keep him from coming back--some.""But there's a line beyond which he may not pass, eh?""There certainly is!--but let's not talk of him.In a secluded corner they sat down on a gilt settee."And it's all so wonderful, this--all this!Smith, I'm so happy
I--I want to cry all the time.And that's so silly--to want to cry!So long--all my life--I've had to WAIT for things so.It was
always by and by, in the future, that I was going to have--anything
that I wanted.And now to have them like this, all at once, everything
I want--why, Mr.Smith, it doesn't seem as if it could be true."But it is true, dear child; and I'm so glad--you've got your
five-pound box of candy all at once at last.And I HOPE you can treat
your friends to unlimited soda waters."A new eagerness came to her
eyes."I'm going to give mother a present--a frivolous, foolish
present, such as I've always wanted to.I'm going to give her a gold
breast-pin with an amethyst in it.And I'm
going to take my own money for it, too,--not the new money that father
gives me, but some money I've been saving up for years--dimes and
quarters and half-dollars in my baby-bank.Mother always made me save
'most every cent I got, you see.And I'm going to take it now for this
pin.She won't mind if I do spend it foolishly now--with all the rest
we have.And she'll be so pleased with the pin!""Yes, always; but she never thought she could afford it.I'm
going to open the bank to-morrow and count it; and I'm so excited over
it!"Fulton himself ever
took more joy counting his millions than I shall take in counting those
quarters and half-dollars to-morrow."Smith spoke with confident emphasis,
yet in a voice that was not quite steady.Smith," smiled Mellicent, a bit mistily.And we miss you terribly--honestly we
do!--since you went away.But I'm glad Aunt Maggie's got you.That's the only thing that makes me feel bad,--about the money,
I mean,--and that is that she didn't have some, too.But mother's going
to give her some.She SAYS she is, and--"

But Mellicent did not finish her sentence.A short, sandy-haired youth
came up and pointed an accusing finger at her dance card; and Mellicent
said yes, the next dance was his.Smith
as she floated away, and Mr.Smith, well content, turned and walked
into the adjoining room.These two
ladies, also, were pictures of radiant loveliness--especially were they
radiant, for every beam of light found an answering flash in the
shimmering iridescence of their beads and jewels and opalescent sequins.Smith, what do you think of my party?"Hattie tapped his shoulder with her fan."I think a great deal--of your party," smiled the man."Oh, it'll do--for Hillerton."Miss Bessie smiled mischievously into
her mother's eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and passed on into the
music-room."As if it wasn't quite the finest thing Hillerton ever had--except the
Gaylord parties, of course," bridled Mrs."That's just daughter's way of teasing me--and, of course, now she IS
where she sees the real thing in entertaining--she goes home with those
rich girls in her school, you know.But this is a nice party, isn't it
Mr."Daughter says we should have wine; that everybody who is anybody has
wine now--champagne, and cigarettes for the ladies.Still, I've heard the Gaylords do.I've never been there
yet, though, of course, we shall be invited now.I'm crazy to see the
inside of their house; but I don't believe it's MUCH handsomer than
this.You've never been
there, any more than I have, and you're a man of simple tastes, I
judge, Mr."Benny says that Aunt
Maggie's got the nicest house he ever saw, and that Mr.So, you see, I have grounds for my opinion.""Well, I'm not sure I ever said just that to Benny, but I'll not
dispute it.Miss Maggie's house is indeed wonderfully delightful--to
live in.""I've no doubt of it," conceded Mrs.She always did contrive to make the most of everything she had.But
she's never been ambitious for really nice things, I imagine.At least,
she always seems contented enough with her shabby chairs and carpets.While I--" She paused, looked about her, then drew a blissful sigh.Smith, you don't know--you CAN'T know what it is to me to just look
around and realize that they are all mine--these beautiful things!"Smith, there isn't a piece of furniture in this room
that didn't cost more than the Pennocks'--I know, because I've been
there.And my curtains are nicer, too, and my pictures, they're so much
brighter--some of her oil paintings are terribly dull-looking.And my
Bessie--did you notice her dress to-night?And if you had, you wouldn't have realized how expensive it
was.What do you know about the cost of women's dresses?"It was one hundred and fifty
dollars, a HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS, and it came from New York.I
don't believe that white muslin thing of Gussie Pennock's cost fifty!"Yes, of course you have--with Fred.He
goes with Pearl Gaylord more now.There, you can see them this minute,
dancing together--the one in the low-cut, blue dress.Pretty, too,
isn't she?Her father's worth a million, I suppose.I wonder how
'twould feel to be worth--a million."She spoke musingly, her eyes
following the low-cut blue dress."But, then, maybe I shall know, some
time,--from Cousin Stanley, I mean," she explained smilingly, in answer
to the question she thought she saw behind Mr."Oh, of course, there's nothing sure about it.But he gave us SOME, and
if he's dead, of course, that other letter'll be opened in two years;
and I don't see why he wouldn't give us the rest, as long as he'd shown
he remembered he'd got us."Well--er--as to that--" Mr."Well, there aren't any other relations so near, anyway, so I can't
help thinking about it, and wondering," she interposed."And 'twould be
MILLIONS, not just one million.He's worth ten or twenty, they say.But, then, we shall know in time.""Oh, yes, you'll know--in time," agreed Mr.Smith with a smile, turning
away as another guest came up to his hostess.Smith's smile had been rather forced, and his face was still
somewhat red as he picked his way through the crowded rooms to the
place where he could see Frank Blaisdell standing alone, surveying the
scene, his hands in his pockets.Smith, this is some show, ain't it?'greeted the grocer, as
Mr.I should say so--though I can't say I'm stuck on the brand,
myself.But, as for this money business, do you know?I can't sense it yet--that it's true.Ain't she swingin' the style to-night?""She certainly is looking handsome and very happy."I believe in takin'
some comfort as you go along--not that I've taken much, in times past.Why, man, I'm just like a potato-top grown in a cellar,
and I'm comin' out and get some sunshine.SHE'S been a potato-top in a cellar all right.But now--Have you
seen her to-night?""I have--and a very charming sight she was," smiled Mr."Well, she's goin' to be
that right along now.She's GOIN' where she wants to go, and DO what
she wants to do; and she's goin' to have all the fancy fluma-diddles to
wear she wants."I'm glad to hear that, too," laughed Mr.This savin' an' savin' is all very well, of course, when
you have to.But I've saved all my life and, by jingo, I'm goin' to
spend now!I'm glad to have one on my side, anyhow.I only wish--You
couldn't talk my wife 'round to your way of thinkin', could you?"he
shrugged, with a whimsical smile."My wife's eaten sour cream to save
the sweet all her life, an' she hain't learned yet that if she'd eat
the sweet to begin with she wouldn't have no sour cream--'twouldn't
have time to get sour.She eats the specked
ones always; so she don't never eat anything but the worst there is.An' she says they're the meanest apples she ever saw.Now I tell her if
she'll only pick out the best there is every time, as I do she'll not
only enjoy every apple she eats, but she'll think they're the nicest
apples that ever grew.Here I am havin' to urge my
wife to spend money, while my sister-in-law here--Talk about ducks
takin' to the water!That ain't no name for the way she sails into
Jim's little pile.""Hain't seen him--but I can guess where he is, pretty well.You go down
that hall and turn to your left.In a little room at the end you'll
find him.He told Hattie 'twas the only room in the
house he'd ask for, but he wanted to fix it up himself.Hattie, she
wanted to buy all sorts of truck and fix it up with cushions and
curtains and Japanese gimcracks like she see a den in a book, and make
a showplace of it.There ain't
nothin' in it but books and chairs and a couch and a big table; and
they're all old--except the books--so Hattie don't show it much, when
she's showin' off the house.Jim always would rather read than eat, and he hates
shindigs of this sort a little worse 'n I do."I'll look
him up," nodded Mr.Deliberately, but with apparent carelessness, strolled Mr.Smith
through the big drawing-rooms, and down the hall.Then to the left--the
directions were not hard to follow, and the door of the room at the end
was halfway open, giving a glimpse of James Blaisdell and Benny before
the big fireplace.With a gentle tap and a cheerful "Do you allow intruders?"James Blaisdell sprang to his feet.The frown on his face
gave way to a smile."I thought--Well, never mind what I thought."Thank you, if you don't mind."Smith dropped into a chair and looked about him."It's'most as nice as Aunt Maggie's,
ain't it?And I can eat all the cookies here I want to, and come in
even if my shoes are muddy, and bring the boys in, too.""It certainly is--great," agreed Mr.Smith, his admiring eyes sweeping
the room again.The deep,
comfortable chairs, the shaded lights, the leaping fire on the hearth,
the book-lined walls--even the rhythmic voices of the distant violins
seemed to sing of peace and quietness and rest."Dad's been showin' me the books he used ter like when he was a little
boy like me," announced Benny."Hain't he got a lot of 'em?--books, I
mean."James Blaisdell stirred a little in his chair."I suppose I have--crowded them a little," he admitted."But, you see,
there were so many I'd always wanted, and when the chance came--well, I
just bought them; that's all.""And you have the time now to read them.""I have, thank--Well, I suppose I should say thanks to Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton," he laughed, with some embarrassment.Fulton could
know--how much I do thank him," he finished soberly, his eyes caressing
the rows of volumes on the shelves."You see, when you've wanted
something all your life--" He stopped with an expressive gesture."You don't care much for--that, then, I take it," inferred Mr.Smith,
with a wave of his hand toward the distant violins."Dad says there's only one thing worse than a party, and that's two
parties," piped up Benny from his seat on the rug.Smith laughed heartily, but the other looked still more discomfited."I'm afraid Benny is--is telling tales out of school," he murmured."Well, 'tis out of school, ain't it?"Smith, did you have ter go ter a private school when you were a little
boy?But if it's Cousin
Stanley's money that's made us somebody, I wished he'd kept it at
home--'fore I had ter go ter that old school.""Oh, come, come, my boy," remonstrated the father, drawing his son into
the circle of his arm."That's neither kind nor grateful; besides, you
don't know what you're talking about.From case to case, then, they went, the host eagerly displaying and
explaining, the guest almost as eagerly watching and listening.And in
the kindling eye and reverent fingers of the man handling the volumes,
Mr.Smith caught some inkling of what those books meant to Jim
Blaisdell."You must be fond of--books, Mr.Blaisdell," he said somewhat
awkwardly, after a time."Ma says dad'd rather read than eat," giggled Benny; "but pa says
readin' IS eatin'.But I'd rather have a cookie, wouldn't you, Mr."You wait till you find what there IS in these books, my son," smiled
his father."You'll love them as well as I do, some day.And your
brother--" He paused, a swift shadow on his face."My boy, Fred, loves books, too.He helped me a lot in my
buying.He was in here--a little while ago.But he couldn't stay, of
course.He said he had to go and dance with the girls--his mother
expected it."Just as if he didn't want ter go himself!""You couldn't HIRE him ter stay away--'specially if Pearl
Gaylord's 'round.""Oh, well, he's young, and young feet always dance When Pan pipes,"
explained the father, with a smile that was a bit forced."But Pan
doesn't always pipe, and he's ambitious--Fred is."The man turned
eagerly to Mr."He's going to be a lawyer--you see, he's
got a chance now.He led his class in high school,
and he'll make good in college, I'm sure.He can have the best there is
now, too, without killing himself with work to get it.He's got a fine
mind, and--" The man stopped abruptly, with a shamed laugh.You'll forgive 'the fond father,' I know.I
always forget myself when I'm talking of that boy--or, rather perhaps
it's that I'm REMEMBERING myself.You see, I want him to do all that I
wanted to do--and couldn't.And--"

"Jim, JIM!""There, I might have
known where I'd find you.Come, the guests are going, and are looking
for you to say good-night.They'll think we don't know anything--how to behave, and
all that.Smith, you'll excuse him, I know.""I must be going myself, for that
matter," he finished, as he followed his hostess through the doorway.Five minutes later he had found Miss Maggie, and was making his adieus.Miss Maggie, on the way home, was strangely silent."Well, that was some party," began Mr.[Illustration with caption: "JIM, YOU'LL HAVE TO COME!"]"I'm glad at last to see that poor child enjoying herself."Smith frowned and stole a sidewise glance at his companion.Could Miss Maggie be showing at last a tinge of envy and
jealousy?And yet--

"Even Miss Flora seemed to be having a good time, in spite of that
funereal black," he hazarded again.James Blaisdell and Miss Bessie were very radiant
and shining.""Oh, yes, they--shone."Smith bit his lip, and stole another sidewise glance.James Blaisdell was so fond of--er--books.I had
quite a chat with him in his den.""He says Fred--"

"Did you see that Gaylord girl?"Miss Maggie was galvanized into sudden
life."He's perfectly bewitched with her.And she--that ridiculous
dress--and for a young girl!Oh, I wish Hattie would let those people
alone!""Oh, well, he'll be off to college next week," soothed Mr.Her brother!--and he's worse than she is, if
anything.Why, he was drunk to-night, actually drunk, when he came!I don't want Fred with any of them.""No, I don't like their looks myself very well, but--I fancy young
Blaisdell has a pretty level head on him.His father says--"

"His father worships him," interrupted Miss Maggie.But into Fred--into Fred he's pouring his whole lost
youth.You don't understand, of course, Mr.You
haven't known him all the way, as I have."Miss Maggie's voice shook
with suppressed feeling.From boyhood he was going to write--great plays, great
poems, great novels.I think he
even tried to sell his things, in his 'teens; but of course nothing
came of that--but rejection slips.Of
course, we couldn't send him.He couldn't stand
the double task, and he broke down completely.We sent him into the
country to recuperate, and there he met Hattie Snow, fell head over
heels in love with her blue eyes and golden hair, and married her on
the spot.Of course, there was nothing to do then but to go to work,
and Mr.Hammond took him into his real estate and insurance office.He's been there ever since, plodding plodding, plodding.""You can imagine there wasn't much time left for books.I think, when
he first went there, he thought he was still going to write the great
poem, the great play the great novel, that was to bring him fame and
money.Hattie had little patience with his
scribbling, and had less with the constant necessity of scrimping and
economizing.She was always ambitious to get ahead and be somebody,
and, of course, as the babies came and the expenses increased, the
demand for more money became more and more insistent.He worked, and worked hard, and then
he got a job for evenings and worked harder.But I don't believe he
ever quite caught up.That's why I was so glad when this money
came--for Jim.he's thrown his whole lost youth
into Fred.And Fred--"

"Fred is going to make good.But--I wish those Gaylords had been at the bottom of
the Red Sea before they ever came to Hillerton," she fumed with sudden
vehemence as she entered her own gate.CHAPTER XIV

FROM ME TO YOU WITH LOVE


It was certainly a gay one--that holiday week.Beginning with the James
Blaisdells' housewarming it was one continuous round of dances,
dinners, sleigh-rides and skating parties for Hillerton's young people
particularly for the Blaisdells, the Pennocks, and the Gaylords.Smith, at Miss Maggie's, saw comparatively little of it all, though
he had almost daily reports from Benny, Mellicent, or Miss Flora, who
came often to Miss Maggie's for a little chat.It was from Miss Flora
that he learned the outcome of Mellicent's present to her mother.The
week was past, and Miss Flora had come down to Miss Maggie's for a
little visit.Smith still worked at the table in the corner of the living-room,
though the Duff-Blaisdell records were all long ago copied.He was at
work now sorting and tabulating other Blaisdell records.Smith
seemed to find no end to the work that had to be done on his Blaisdell
book.As Miss Flora entered the room she greeted Mr.Smith cordially, and
dropped into a chair."Well, they've gone at last," she panted, handing her furs to Miss
Maggie; "so I thought I'd come down and talk things over.Smith," she begged, as he made a move toward departure."I hain't
come; to say nothin' private; besides, you're one of the family,
anyhow.Smith went back to his table, and Miss Flora
settled herself more comfortably in Miss Maggie's easiest chair."So they're all gone," said Miss Maggie cheerily."Yes; an' it's time they did, to my way of thinkin'.Mercy me, what a
week it has been!They hain't been still a minute, not one of 'em,
except for a few hours' sleep--toward mornin'.""But what a good time they've had!"And didn't it do your soul good to see Mellicent?But Jane--Jane
nearly had a fit.She told Mellicent that all this gayety was nothing
but froth and flimsiness and vexation of spirit.That she knew it
because she'd been all through it when she was young, and she knew the
vanity of it.And Mellicent--what do you suppose that child said?""I can't imagine," smiled Miss Maggie."She said SHE wanted to see the vanity of it, too.Pretty cute of her,
too, wasn't it?Still it's just as well she's gone back to school, I
think myself.She's been repressed and held back so long, that when she
did let loose, it was just like cutting the puckering string of a
bunched-up ruffle--she flew in all directions, and there was no holding
her back anywhere; and I suppose she has been a bit foolish and
extravagant in the things she's asked for.Poor dear, though, she did
get one setback.""Did she tell you about the present for her mother?""That she was going to get it--yes."Miss Flora's thin lips snapped grimly over the
terse words.And 'twas a beauty--one of them light purple stones with two
pearls.Mellicent showed it to me--on the way home from the store, you
know.'Oh, I don't mind the saving all
those years now,' she cried, 'when I see what a beautiful thing they've
let me get for mother' And she went off so happy she just couldn't keep
her feet from dancing."'"I can imagine it," nodded Miss Maggie."Well, in an hour she was back.All the light
and happiness and springiness were gone.She
still carried the little box in her hand.'I'm takin' it back,' she
choked."'Oh, yes, she liked the pin,' said Mellicent, all teary;'she thinks
it's beautiful.She says she never heard
of such foolish goings-on--paying all that money for a silly, useless
pin.I--I told her 'twas a PRESENT from me, but she made me take it
back.I'm on my way now back to the store.I'm to get the money, if I
can.If I can't, I'm to get a credit slip.Mother says we can take it
up in forks and spoons and things we need.I--I told her 'twas a
present, but--' She couldn't say another word, poor child.She just
turned and almost ran from the room.She went away
this morning, I suppose.I didn't see her again, so I don't know how
she did come out with the store-man."Smith had fallen to writing furiously, with vicious little jabs of his
pencil.)"But Jane never did believe in present-giving.They never gave
presents to each other even at Christmas.She always called it a
foolish, wasteful practice, and Mellicent was always SO unhappy
Christmas morning!"Jane
never let 'em take even comfort, and now that they CAN take some
comfort, Jane's got so out of the habit, she don't know how to begin.""I don't think YOU can
say much on that score.""Why, Maggie Duff, I'M taking comfort," bridled Miss Flora."Didn't I
have chicken last week and turkey three weeks ago?And do I ever skimp
the butter or hunt for cake-rules with one egg now?And ain't I going
to Niagara and have a phonograph and move into a fine place just as
soon as my mourning is up?"All right, I'll wait," laughed Miss Maggie.Then, a bit anxiously, she
asked: "Did Fred go to-day?""Yes, looking fine as a fiddle, too.I was sweeping off the steps when
he went by the house.Said he was going in now
for real work--that he'd played long enough.He said he wouldn't be
good for a row of pins if he had many such weeks as this had been.""I'm glad he realized it," observed Miss Maggie grimly."I suppose the
Gaylord young people went, too.""Hibbard did, but Pearl doesn't go till next week.She isn't in the
same school with Bess, you know.It's even grander than Bess's they
say.Hattie wants to get Bess into it next year.Oh, I forgot; we've
got to call her 'Elizabeth' now.Hattie says nicknames are all out now, and that
'Elizabeth' is very stylish and good form and the only proper thing to
call her.She says we must call her 'Harriet,' too.But I'm afraid I shall forget--sometimes.""I'm afraid--a good many of us will," laughed Miss Maggie."It all came from them Gaylords, I believe," sniffed Flora."I don't
think much of 'em; but Hattie seems to.I notice she don't put nothin'
discouragin' in the way of young Gaylord and Bess.But he pays'most as
much attention to Mellicent, so far as I can see, whenever Carl Pennock
will give him a chance.Did you ever see the beat of that boy?I hope Mellicent'll give him a good lesson, before
she gets through with it.He deserves it," she ejaculated, as she
picked up her fur neck-piece, and fastened it with a jerk.In the doorway she paused and glanced cautiously toward Mr.Smith, perceiving the glance, tried very hard to absorb himself in the
rows of names dates before him; but he could not help hearing Miss
Flora's next words."Maggie, hain't you changed your mind a mite yet?WON'T you let me give
you some of my money?But Miss Maggie, with a violent shake of her head, almost pushed Miss
Flora into the hall and shut the door firmly.Smith, left alone at his table, wrote again furiously, and with
vicious little jabs of his pencil.Smith was finding
a most congenial home.He liked Miss Maggie better than ever, on closer
acquaintance.The Martin girls fitted pleasantly into the household,
and plainly did much to help the mistress of the house.Father Duff was
still as irritable as ever, but he was not so much in evidence, for his
increasing lameness was confining him almost entirely to his own room.This meant added care for Miss Maggie, but, with the help of the
Martins, she still had some rest and leisure, some time to devote to
the walks and talks with Mr.Smith said it was absolutely
imperative, for the sake of her health, that she should have some
recreation, and that it was an act of charity, anyway, that she should
lighten his loneliness by letting him walk and talk with her.Smith could not help wondering a good deal these days about Miss
Maggie's financial resources.He knew from various indications that
they must be slender.Yet he never heard her plead poverty or preach
economy.In spite of the absence of protecting rugs and tidies,
however, and in spite of the fact that she plainly conducted her life
and household along the lines of the greatest possible comfort, he saw
many evidences that she counted the pennies--and that she made every
penny count.He knew, for a fact, that she had refused to accept any of the
Blaisdells' legacy.Jane, to be sure, had not offered any money yet
(though she had offered the parlor carpet, which had been promptly
refused), but Frank and James and Flora had offered money, and had
urged her to take it.Miss Maggie, however would have none of it.Smith suspected that Miss Maggie was proud, and that she regarded
such a gift as savoring too much of charity.Smith wished HE could
say something to Miss Maggie.Smith was, indeed, not a little
disturbed over the matter.He did try once to say something; but Miss
Maggie tossed it off with a merry: "Take their money?I should
feel as if I were eating up some of Jane's interest, or one of Hattie's
gold chairs!"After that she would not let him get near the subject.There seemed then really nothing that he could do.It was about this
time, however, that Mr.Smith began to demand certain extra
luxuries--honey, olives, sardines, candied fruits, and imported
jellies.They were always luxuries that must be bought, not prepared in
the home; and he promptly increased the price of his board--but to a
sum far beyond the extra cost of the delicacies he ordered.When Miss
Maggie remonstrated at the size of the increase, he pooh-poohed her
objections, and declared that even that did not pay for having such a
nuisance of a boarder around, with all his fussy notions.He insisted,
moreover, that the family should all partake freely of the various
delicacies, declaring that it seemed to take away the sting of his
fussiness if they ate as he ate, and so did not make him appear
singular in his tastes.They often came to Miss Maggie's, and occasionally he
called at their homes.They seemed to regard him, indeed, as quite one of the family, and they
asked his advice, and discussed their affairs before him with as much
freedom as if he were, in truth, a member of the family.Hattie Blaisdell was having a very gay winter, and
that she had been invited twice to the Gaylords'.He knew that James
Blaisdell was happy in long evenings with his books before the fire.From Fred's mother he learned that Fred had made the most exclusive
club in college, and from Fred's father he learned that the boy was
already leading his class in his studies.He heard of Bessie's visits
to the homes of wealthy New Yorkers, and of the trials Benny's teachers
were having with Benny.He knew something of Miss Flora's placid life in her "house of
mourning" (as Bessie had dubbed the little cottage), and he heard of
the "perfectly lovely times" Mellicent was having at her finishing
school.He dropped in occasionally to talk over the price of beans and
potatoes with Mr.Frank Blaisdell in his bustling grocery store, and he
often saw Mrs.It was at Miss Maggie's, indeed,
one day, that he heard Mrs.Jane say, as she sank wearily into a
chair:--

"Well, I declare!Sometimes I think I'll never give anybody a thing
again!"Smith, at his table, was conscious of a sudden lively interest.So
often, in his earlier acquaintance with Mrs.Jane, while he boarded
there, had he heard her say to mission-workers, church-solicitors, and
doorway beggars, alike, something similar to this; "No, I can give you
nothing.I'd love to, if I could--really I
would.It makes me quite unhappy to hear of all this need and
suffering.And if I were rich I would; but
as it is, I can only give you my sympathy and my prayers."He had wondered several times,
since the money came, as to Mrs.Hence his interest now
in what she was about to say."Why, Jane, what's the matter?""And positively a more
ungrateful set of people all around I never saw.You know I've never been able to do anything.And now I was so happy that I COULD do something, and I told
them so; and they seemed real pleased at first.I gave two dollars
apiece to the Ladies' Aid, the Home Missionary Society, and the Foreign
Missionary Society--and, do you know?They
acted for all the world as if they expected more--the grasping things!On the way home, just as I passed the Gale girls' I heard
Sue say: 'What's two dollars to her?"What's the good of giving, if you aren't going to get any credit, or
thanks, just because you're rich, I should like to know?"Look at Cousin Mary Davis--YOU know how poor they've
always been, and how hard it's been for them to get along.Her
Carrie--Mellicent's age, you know--has had to go to work in Hooper's
store.Well, I sent Mellicent's old white lace party dress to Mary.'Twas some soiled, of course, and a little torn; but I thought she
could clean it and make it over beautifully for Carrie.But, what do
you think?--back it came the next day with a note from Mary saying very
crisply that Carrie had no place to wear white lace dresses, and they
had no time to make it over if she did.Didn't I invite her to my housewarming?But how
are you going to help a person like that?""But, Jane, there must be ways--some ways."Miss Maggie's forehead was
wrinkled into a troubled frown.Davis has
been sick a long time, you remember.""Yes, I know he has; and that's all the more reason, to my way of
thinking, why they should be grateful for anything--ANYTHING!The
trouble is, she wants to be helped in ways of her own choosing.They
wanted Frank to take Sam, the boy,--he's eighteen now--into the store,
and they wanted me to get embroidery for Nellie to do at home--she's
lame, you know, but she does do beautiful work.Frank hates relatives in the store; he says they cause all
sorts of trouble with the other help; and I certainly wasn't going to
ask him to take any relatives of MINE.As for Nellie--I DID ask Hattie
if she couldn't give her some napkins to do, or something, and she gave
me a dozen for her--she said Nellie'd probably do them as cheap as
anybody, and maybe cheaper.But she told me not to go to the Gaylords
or the Pennocks, or any of that crowd, for she wouldn't have them know
for the world that we had a relative right here in town that had to
take in sewing.I told her they weren't her relations nor the
Blaisdells'; they were mine, and they were just as good as her folks
any day, and that it was no disgrace to be poor.Besides, she got mad then, and took back the
dozen napkins she'd given me.So I didn't have anything for poor
Nellie.Miss Maggie's lips shut in a thin straight line."Besides, if I'd taken
them to her, they wouldn't have appreciated it, I know.Why, last November, when the money came, I sent
them nearly all of Mellicent's and my old summer things--and if little
Tottie didn't go and say afterwards that her mamma did wish Cousin Jane
wouldn't send muslins in December when they hadn't room enough to store
a safety pin.Oh, of course, Mary didn't say that to ME, but she must
have said it somewhere, else Tottie wouldn't have got hold of it.'Children and fools,' you know," she finished meaningly, as she rose to
go.Smith noticed that Miss Maggie seemed troubled that evening, and he
knew that she started off early the next morning and was gone nearly
all day, coming home only for a hurried luncheon.It being Saturday,
the Martin girls were both there to care for Father Duff and the house.Smith suspect that he had learned the
reason for all this.Then a thin-faced young girl with tired eyes came
to tea one evening and was introduced to him as Miss Carrie Davis.Later, when Miss Maggie had gone upstairs to put Father Duff to bed,
Mr.Smith heard Carrie Davis telling Annabelle Martin all about how
kind Miss Maggie had been to Nellie, finding her all that embroidery to
do for that rich Mrs.Gaylord, and how wonderful it was that she had
been able to get such a splendid job for Sam right in Hooper's store
where she was.Smith thought he understood then Miss Maggie's long absence on
Saturday.Smith was often running across little kindnesses that Miss Maggie
had done.He began to think that Miss Maggie must be a very charitable
person--until he ran across several cases that she had not helped.Then
he did not know exactly what to think.His first experience of this kind was when he met an unmistakably
"down-and-out" on the street one day, begging clothing, food, anything,
and telling a sorry tale of his unjust discharge from a local factory.Smith gave the man a dollar, and sent him to Miss Maggie.He
happened to know that Father Duff had discarded an old suit that
morning--and Father Duff and the beggar might have been taken for twins
as to size.On the way home a little later he met the beggar returning,
just as forlorn, and even more hungry-looking."Well, my good fellow, couldn't she fix you up?"She
didn't fix me up ter nothin'--but chin music!"A few days later he heard an eager-eyed young woman begging Miss Maggie
for a contribution to the Pension Fund Fair in behalf of the underpaid
shopgirls in Daly's.Daly's was a Hillerton department Store, notorious
for its unfair treatment of its employees.Miss Maggie seemed interested, and asked many questions.The eager-eyed
young woman became even more eager-eyed, and told Miss Maggie all about
the long hours, the nerve-wearing labor, the low wages--wages upon
which it was impossible for any girl to live decently--wages whose
meagerness sent many a girl to her ruin.Miss Maggie listened attentively, and said, "Yes, yes, I see," several
times.But in the end the eager-eyed young woman went away empty-handed
and sad-eyed.He had thought Miss Maggie was so kind-hearted!She gave to some
fairs--why not to this one?Smith hunted up the
eager-eyed young woman and gave her ten dollars.He would have given
her more, but he had learned from unpleasant experience that large
gifts from unpretentious Mr.John Smith brought comments and curiosity
not always agreeable.It was not until many weeks later that Mr.Smith chanced to hear of the
complete change of policy of Daly's department store.Hours were
shortened, labor lightened, and wages raised.Incidentally he learned
that it had all started from a crusade of women's clubs and church
committees who had "got after old Daly" and threatened all sorts of
publicity and unpleasantness if the wrongs were not righted at once.He
learned also that the leader in the forefront of this movement had
been--Maggie Duff.As it chanced, it was on that same day that a strange man accosted him
on the street."Say, she was all right, she was, old man.I been hopin' I'd see ye
some day ter tell ye.""Ye don't know me, do ye?Well, I do look diff'rent, I'll own.Ye give
me a dollar once, an' sent me to a lady down the street thar.I thought 'twas only
chin-music she was givin' me.She hunted up the
wife an' kids, an' what's more, she went an' faced my boss, an' she got
me my job back, too."Why, I'm--I'm glad, of course!"CHAPTER XV

IN SEARCH OF REST


June brought all the young people home again.It brought, also, a great
deal of talk concerning plans for vacation.Bessie--Elizabeth--said
they must all go away.From James Blaisdell this brought a sudden and vigorous remonstrance."Nonsense, you've just got home!""Hillerton'll be a
vacation to you all right.I
haven't seen a thing of my children for six months."(Elizabeth had learned to give very
silvery laughs.)She shrugged her shoulders daintily and looked at her
rings.You wouldn't really doom us to Hillerton all summer,
daddy.""What isn't the matter with Hillerton?""But I thought we--we would have lovely auto trips," stammered her
mother apologetically."Take them from here, you know, and stay
overnight at hotels around.I've always wanted to do that; and we can
now, dear.""Why, mumsey, we're going to
the shore for July, and to the mountains for August.You and daddy and
I. And Fred's going, too, only he'll be at the Gaylord camp in the
Adirondacks, part of the time."James Blaisdell's eyes, fixed on his son, were
half wistful, half accusing."Well, I sort of had to, governor," he apologized.There are some things a man has to do!Gaylord asked me, and--Hang it
all, I don't see why you have to look at me as if I were committing a
crime, dad!""You aren't, dear, you aren't," fluttered Fred's mother hurriedly; "and
I'm sure it's lovely you've got the chance to go to the Gaylords' camp.And it's right, quite right, that we should travel this summer, as
Bessie--er--Elizabeth suggests.I never thought; but, of course, you
young people don't want to be hived up in Hillerton all summer!""Bet your life we don't, mater," shrugged Fred, carefully avoiding his
father's eyes, "after all that grind."But Fred had turned away, and did not, apparently, hear his father's
grieved question.Smith learned all about the vacation plans a day or two later from
Benny."Yep, we're all goin' away for all summer," he repeated, after he had
told the destination of most of the family."I don't think ma wants to,
much, but she's goin' on account of Bess.Besides, she says everybody
who is anybody always goes away on vacations, of course.They're goin' to the beach first, and I'm goin' to a boys' camp up
in Vermont--Mellicent, she's goin' to a girls' camp."She tried to get Bess to go--Gussie
Pennock's goin'.But Bess!--my you should see her nose go up in the
air!She said she wa'n't goin' where she had to wear great coarse shoes
an' horrid middy-blouses all day, an' build fires an' walk miles an'
eat bugs an' grasshoppers.""Is Miss Mellicent going to do all that?""Bess says she is--I mean, ELIZABETH.We have to call her
that now, when we don't forget it.Have you seen
her since she came back?""She's swingin' an awful lot of style--Bess is.She makes dad dress up
in his swallow-tail every night for dinner.An' she makes him and Fred
an' me stand up the minute she comes into the room, no matter if
there's forty other chairs in sight; an' we have to STAY standin' till
she sits down--an' sometimes she stands up a-purpose, just to keep US
standing.She says a gentleman never sits when a lady
is standin' up in his presence.An' she's lecturin' us all the time on
the way to eat an' talk an' act.Why, we can't even walk natural any
longer.An' she says the way Katy serves our meals is a disgrace to any
civilized family."She got mad an' gave notice on the spot.An' that made ma
'most have hysterics--she did have one of her headaches--'cause good
hired girls are awful scarce, she says.we'll get
some from the city next time that know their business, an' we're goin'
away all summer, anyway, an' won't ma please call them'maids,' as she
ought to, an' not that plebeian 'hired girl.'Everything's 'plebeian' with Bess now.Oh we're havin' great times at
our house since Bess--ELIZABETH--came!"grinned Benny, tossing his cap
in the air, and dancing down the walk much as he had danced the first
night Mr.The James Blaisdells were hardly off to shore and camp when Miss Flora
started on her travels.Smith learned all about her plans, too, for
she came down one day to talk them over with Miss Maggie.Miss Flora was looking very well in a soft gray and white summer silk.Her forehead had lost its lines of care, and her eyes were no longer
peering for wrinkles.panted Miss Flora, as she fluttered up the steps and sank into
one of the porch chairs.Smith was putting
up a trellis for Miss Maggie's new rosebush.He was working faithfully,
but not with the skill of accustomedness.Miss Flora settled back into her chair and
smoothed out the ruffles across her lap."It isn't too gay, is it?You
know the six months are more than up now.""I hoped it wasn't," sighed Miss Flora happily."Well, I'm all packed
but my dresses.""Why, I thought you weren't going till Monday," said Miss Maggie.I suppose I am a little ahead of time.But you see, I
ain't used to packing--not a big trunk, so--and I was so afraid I
wouldn't get it done in time.I was going to put my dresses in; but
Mis' Moore said they'd wrinkle awfully, if I did, and, of course, they
would, when you come to think of it.So I shan't put those in till
Sunday night.I'm so glad Mis' Moore's going.It'll be so nice to have
somebody along that I know.""And she knows everything--all about tickets and checking the baggage,
and all that.You know we're only going to be personally conducted to
Niagara.After that we're going to New York and stay two weeks at some
nice hotel.I want to see Grant's Tomb and the Aquarium, and Mis' Moore
wants to go to Coney Island.She says she's always wanted to go to
Coney Island just as I have to Niagara.""I'm glad you can take her," said Miss Maggie heartily.You know, even if she has such a nice
family, and all, she hasn't much money, and she's been awful nice to me
lately.I used to think she didn't like me, too.But I must have been
mistaken, of course.And 'twas so with Mis' Benson and Mis' Pennock,
too.But now they've invited me there and have come to see me, and are
SO interested in my trip and all.Why, I never knew I had so many
friends, Maggie.Miss Maggie said nothing, but, there was an odd expression on her face.Smith pounded a small nail home with an extra blow of his hammer."And they're all so kind and interested about the money, too," went on
Miss Flora, gently rocking to and fro."Bert Benson sells stocks and
invests money for folks, you know, and Mis' Benson said he'd got some
splendid-payin' ones, and he'd let me have some, and--"

"Flo, you DIDN'T take any of that Benson gold-mine stock!"Smith's hammer stopped, suspended in mid-air.Miss Maggie relaxed in her chair, and Mr.Smith's hammer fell with a
gentle tap on the nail-head."But I felt real bad about it--when Mis'
Benson had been so kind as to offer it, you know.It looked sort of--of
ungrateful, so."Miss Maggie's voice vibrated with indignant scorn."Flora, you won't--you WON'T invest your money without asking Mr.Chalmers's advice first, will you?""But I tell you I didn't," retorted Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness,
for her."But it was good stock, and it pays splendidly."Jane!--but I thought Frank wouldn't let her.""Oh, Frank said all right, if she wanted to, she might.I suspect he
got tired of her teasing, and it did pay splendidly.Why, 'twill pay
twenty-five per cent, probably, this year, Mis' Benson says.You see, he felt he'd got to pacify Jane some way, I s'pose,
she's so cut up about his selling out."Miss Flora
gave the satisfied little wriggle with which a born news-lover always
prefaces her choicest bit of information."Frank has sold his grocery
stores--both of 'em."Why, I should as soon think of his--his selling himself,"
cried Mr."Well, they ain't--because he's separated 'em."Miss Flora was rocking
a little faster now.That he's worked hard all his life, and it's
time he took some comfort.He says he doesn't take a minute of comfort
now 'cause Jane's hounding him all the time to get more money, to get
more money.She's crazy to see the interest mount up, you know--Jane
is.But he says he don't want any more money.He wants to SPEND money
for a while.He's going to retire from
business and enjoy himself."Smith, "this is a piece of news, indeed!""I should say it was," cried Miss Maggie, still almost incredulous."Oh, she's turribly fussed up over it, as you'd know she would be.Such
a good chance wasted, she thinks, when he might be making all that
money earn more.You know Jane wants to turn everything into money now.Honestly, Maggie, I don't believe Jane can look at the moon nowadays
without wishing it was really gold, and she had it to put out to
interest!""Well, it's so," maintained Miss Flora, "So 't ain't any wonder, of
course, that she's upset over this.That's why Frank give in to her, I
think, and let her buy that Benson stock.Besides, he's feeling
especially flush, because he's got the cash the stores brought, too."I'm sorry about that stock," frowned Miss Maggie.Mis' Benson said 'twas," comforted Miss
Flora."When
did this happen--the sale of the store, I mean?"She's ALWAYS hated it that Frank had a grocery store,
you know; and since the money's come, and she's been going with the
Gaylords and the Pennocks, and all that crowd, she's felt worse than
ever.She was saying to me only last week how ashamed she was to think
that her friends might see her own brother-in-law any day wearing
horrid white coat, and selling molasses over the counter.My, but
Hattie'll be tickled all right--or 'Harriet,' I suppose I should say,
but I never can remember it."But what is Frank going to--to do with himself?""Why, Flora, he'll be lost without that grocery store!""Oh, he's going to travel, first.He says he always wanted to, and he's
got a chance now, and he's going to.They're going to the Yellowstone
Park and the Garden of the Gods and to California.And that's another
thing that worries Jane--spending all that money for them just to ride
in the cars.""Oh, yes, she's going, too.She says she's got to go to keep Frank from
spending every cent he's got," laughed Miss Flora."I was over there
last night, and they told me all about it.""Just as soon as they can get ready.Frank's got to help Donovan, the
man that's bought the store, a week till he gets the run of things, he
says.Miss Flora got to
her feet, and smoothed out the folds of her skirt."He's as tickled as
a boy with a new jack-knife.Frank has been a turrible
hard worker all his life.I'm glad he's going to take some comfort,
same as I am."When Miss Flora had gone, Miss Maggie turned to Mr.Smith with eyes
that still carried dazed unbelief."DID Flora say that Frank Blaisdell had sold his grocery stores?"Jane, that he ought not to enjoy his
money, certainly?"He's got money enough to retire, if he wants to, and he's
certainly worked hard enough to earn a rest."But, to me, it's--just this: while he's
got plenty to retire UPON, he hasn't got anything to--to retire TO.""And, pray, what do you mean by that?"Smith, I've known that man from the time he was trading
jack-knives and marbles and selling paper boxes for five pins.I
remember the whipping he got, too, for filching sugar and coffee and
beans from the pantry and opening a grocery store in our barn.From
that time to this, that boy has always been trading SOMETHING.He's
been absolutely uninterested in anything else.I don't believe he's
read a book or a magazine since his school days, unless it had
something to do with business or groceries.He hasn't a sign of a
fad--music, photography, collecting things--nothing.Now, what I want to
know is, what is the man going to do?""Oh, he'll find something," laughed Mr."He's going to travel,
first, anyhow.""Yes, he's going to travel, first.And then--we'll see," smiled Miss
Maggie enigmatically, as Mr.By the middle of July the Blaisdells were all gone from Hillerton and there
remained only their letters for Miss Maggie--and for Mr.Miss
Maggie was very generous with her letters.Smith's
genuine interest, she read him extracts from almost every one that
came.And the letters were always interesting--and usually
characteristic.Benny wrote of swimming and tennis matches, and of "hikes" and the
"bully eats."Hattie wrote of balls and gowns and the attention "dear
Elizabeth" was receiving from some really very nice families who were
said to be fabulously rich.Neither James nor Bessie wrote at all.Mellicent wrote frequently--gay, breezy letters full to the brim of the
joy of living.She wrote of tennis, swimming, camp-fire stories, and
mountain trails: they were like Benny's letters in petticoats, Miss
Maggie said.Long and frequent epistles came from Miss Flora.Miss Flora was having
a beautiful time.Niagara was perfectly lovely--only what a terrible
noise it made!She was glad she did not have to stay and hear it
always.She liked New York, only that was noisy, too, though Mrs.Moore liked Coney Island, too, but Miss
Flora much preferred Grant's Tomb, she said.It was so much more quiet
and ladylike.She thought some things at Coney Island were really not
nice at all, and she was surprised that Mrs.Between the lines it could be seen that in spite of all the good times,
Miss Flora was becoming just the least bit homesick.She wrote Miss
Maggie that it did seem queer to go everywhere, and not see a soul to
bow to.It gave her such a lonesome feeling--such a lot of faces, and
not one familiar one!She had tried to make the acquaintance of several
people--real nice people; she knew they were by the way they looked.But they wouldn't say hardly anything to her, nor answer her questions;
and they always got up and moved away very soon.To be sure, there was one nice young man.He was lovely to them, Miss
Flora said.It was when they were down to
Coney Island.He helped them through the crowds, and told them about
lots of nice things they didn't want to miss seeing.He walked with
them, too, quite awhile, showing them the sights.He was very kind--he
seemed so especially kind, after all those other cold-hearted people,
who didn't care!Moore both lost their
pocketbooks, and had such an awful time getting back to New York.It
was right after they had said good-bye to the nice young gentleman that
they discovered that they had lost them.They were so sorry that they
hadn't found it out before, Miss Flora said, for he would have helped
them, she was sure.But though they looked everywhere for him, they
could not find him at all, and they had to appeal to strangers, who
took them right up to a policeman the first thing, which was very
embarrassing, Miss Flora said.Moore felt as if they
had been arrested, almost!Miss Maggie pursed her lips a little, when
she read this letter to Mr.From Jane, also, came several letters, and from Frank Blaisdell one
short scrawl.Frank said he was having a bully time, but that he'd seen some of the
most shiftless-looking grocery stores that he ever set eyes on.He
asked if Maggie knew how trade was at his old store, and if Donovan was
keeping it up to the mark.He said that Jane was well, only she was
getting pretty tired because she WOULD try to see everything at once,
for fear she'd lose something, and not get her money's worth, for all
the world just as she used to eat things to save them.Jane wrote that she was having a very nice time, of course,--she
couldn't help it, with all those lovely things to see; but she said she
never dreamed that just potatoes, meat, and vegetables could cost so
much anywhere as they did in hotels, and as for the prices those
dining-cars charged--it was robbery--sheer robbery!And why an
able-bodied man should be given ten cents every time he handed you your
own hat, she couldn't understand.Smith passed a very quiet summer, but a very
contented one.He kept enough work ahead to amuse him, but never enough
to drive him.He took frequent day-trips to the surrounding towns, and
when possible he persuaded Miss Maggie to go with him.Miss Maggie was
wonderfully good company.As the summer advanced, however, he did not
see so much of her as he wanted to, for Father Duff's increasing
infirmities made more and more demands on her time.Annabelle was learning the
milliner's trade, and Florence had taken a clerkship for afternoons
during the summer.They still helped about the work, and relieved Miss
Maggie whenever possible.They were sensible, jolly girls, and Mr.CHAPTER XVI

THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT


In August Father Duff died.James
Blaisdell was already in town.She wrote
that she could not think of coming down for the funeral, but she
ordered an expensive wreath.Frank and Jane were in the Far West, and
could not possibly have arrived in time, anyway.Smith helped in every way that he could help, and Miss Maggie told
him that he was a great comfort, and that she did not know what she
would have done without him.James Blaisdell helped,
too, in every way possible, and at last the first hard sad days were
over, and the household had settled back into something like normal
conditions again.Miss Maggie had more time now, and she went often to drive or for motor
rides with Mr.Together they explored cemeteries for miles
around; and although Miss Maggie worried sometimes because they found
so little Blaisdell data, Mr.Smith did not seem to mind it at all.In September Miss Flora moved into an attractive house on the West
Side, bought some new furniture, and installed a maid in the
kitchen--all under Miss Maggie's kindly supervision.In September, too,
Frank and Jane Blaisdell came home, and the young people began to
prepare for the coming school year.Hattie one day, coming out of Miss Maggie's gate.She smiled and greeted him cordially, but she looked so palpably upset
over something that he exclaimed to Miss Maggie, as soon he entered the
house: "What was it?Miss Maggie smiled--but she frowned, too."No, oh, no--except that Hattie has discovered that a hundred thousand
dollars isn't a million.""Oh, where she's been this summer she's measured up, of course, with
people a great deal richer than she.Here in
Hillerton her hundred--and two-hundred-dollar dresses looked very grand
to her, but she's discovered that there are women who pay five hundred
and a thousand, and even more.She feels very cheap and
poverty-stricken now, therefore, in her two-hundred-dollar gowns.If she only would stop trying to live like somebody else!""But I thought--I thought this money was making them happy," stammered
Mr."It was--until she realized that somebody else had more," sighed Miss
Maggie, with a shake of her head."Oh, well, she'll get over that.""At any rate, it's brought her husband some comfort.""Y-yes, it has; but--"

"What do you mean by that?"he demanded, when she did not finish her
sentence."I was wondering--if it would bring him any more.""Oh, no, but they've spent a lot--and Hattie is beginning again her old
talk that she MUST have more money in order to live 'even decent.'It
sounds very familiar to me, and to Jim, I suspect, poor fellow.I saw
him the other night, and from what he said, and what she says, I can
see pretty well how things are going.She's trying to get some of her
rich friends to give Jim a better position, where he'll earn more.She
doesn't understand, either, why Jim can't go into the stock market and
make millions, as some men do.I'm afraid she isn't always--patient.She says there are Fred and Elizabeth and Benjamin to educate, and that
she's just got to have more money to tide them over till the rest of
the legacy comes.""Good Heavens, does that
woman think that--" Mr.Smith stopped with the air of one pulling
himself back from an abyss.It is funny--the way she takes that for
granted, isn't it?Still, there are grounds for it, of course."Do YOU think--she'll get more, then?"To my mind the whole thing was rather
extraordinary, anyway, that he should have given them anything--utter
strangers as they were.Still, as Hattie says, as long as he HAS
recognized their existence, why, he may again of course.Still, on the
other hand, he may have very reasonably argued that, having willed them
a hundred thousand apiece, that was quite enough, and he'd give the
rest somewhere else.""And he may come back alive from South America"

"He may.""But Hattie isn't counting on either of these contingencies, and she is
counting on the money," sighed Miss Maggie, sobering again."And
Jim,--poor Jim!--I'm afraid he's going to find it just as hard to keep
caught up now--as he used to."He stood looking
out of the window, apparently in deep thought.Miss Maggie, with another sigh, turned and went out into the kitchen.The next day, on the street, Mr.She was
with a tall, manly-looking, square-jawed young fellow whom Mr.Mellicent smiled and blushed adorably.Then, to
his surprise, she stopped him with a gesture.Smith, I know it's on the street, but I--I want Mr.Gray to meet
you, and I want you to meet Mr.Smith is--is a very good
friend of mine, Donald."Smith greeted Donald Gray with a warm handshake and a keen glance
into his face.The blush, the hesitation, the shy happiness in
Mellicent's eyes had been unmistakable.Smith felt suddenly that
Donald Gray was a man he very much wanted to know--a good deal about.Then he went home and straight to Miss
Maggie."Well, to begin with, he's devoted to Mellicent.""You don't have to tell me that."What I want to know is, who is he?""He's a young man whom Mellicent met this summer.He plays the violin,
and Mellicent played his accompaniments in a church entertainment.He's the son of a minister near their
camp, where the girls went to church.He's
hard hit--that's sure.He came to Hillerton at once, and has gone to
work in Hammond's real estate office."Yes, I did--but her mother doesn't."She says he's worse than Carl Pennock--that he hasn't got
any money, not ANY money.""You don't mean
that she's really letting money stand in the way if Mellicent cares for
him?Why, it was only a year ago that she herself was bitterly
censuring Mrs.Pennock for doing exactly the same thing in the case of
young Pennock and Mellicent.""But--she seems to have forgotten that.""Shoe's on the other foot this time.""I don't think Jane has done much yet, by way of opposition.You see
they've only reached home, and she's just found out about it.But she
told me she shouldn't let it go on, not for a moment.She has other
plans for Mellicent.""Shall I be--meddling in what isn't my business, if I ask what they
are?""You know I am very much
interested in--Miss Mellicent."Perhaps you can suggest--a way out
for us," sighed Miss Maggie."The case is just this: Jane wants
Mellicent to marry Hibbard Gaylord."I've seen young Gray only once, but I'd give more for his
little finger than I would for a cartload of Gaylords!""But Jane--well, Jane feels
otherwise.To begin with, she's very much flattered at Gaylord's
attentions to Mellicent--the more so because he's left Bessie--I beg
her pardon, 'Elizabeth'--for her.""Then Miss Elizabeth is in it, too?"That's one of the reasons why Hattie is so anxious
for more money.She wants clothes and jewels for Bessie so she can keep
pace with the Gaylords.You see there's a wheel within a wheel here.""As near as I can judge, young Gaylord is Bessie's devoted slave--until
Mellicent arrives; then he has eyes only for HER, which piques Bessie
and her mother not a little.They were together more or less all summer
and I think Hattie thought the match was as good as made.Now, once in
Hillerton, back he flies to Mellicent."I think--no, I KNOW she cares for young
Gray; but--well, I might as well admit it, she is ready any time to
flirt outrageously with Hibbard Gaylord, or--or with anybody else, for
that matter.I saw her flirting with you at the party last Christmas!"Miss Maggie's face showed a sudden pink blush.If she'll flirt with young Gaylord AND
OTHERS, it's all right."But I don't like to have her flirt at all, Mr.It's just her bottled-up childhood and youth
bubbling over.She can't help bubbling, she's been repressed so long.She'll come out all right, and she won't come out hand in hand with
Hibbard Gaylord.She'll be quiet, but
she'll be firm.With one hand she'll keep Gray away, and with the other
she'll push Gaylord forward.Even Mellicent herself won't know how it's
done.But it'll be done, and I tremble for the consequences."Smith's eyes had lost their twinkle now.To himself he
muttered: "I wonder if maybe--I hadn't better take a hand in this thing
myself.""You said--I didn't understand what you said," murmured Miss Maggie
doubtfully."Nothing--nothing, Miss Maggie," replied the man.Then, with
business-like alertness, he lifted his chin."How long do you say this
has been going on?""Why, especially since they all came home two weeks ago.Jane knew
nothing of Donald Gray till then.""Oh, he comes in anywhere that he can find a chance; though, to do her
justice, Mellicent doesn't give him--many chances.""What does her father say to all this?"He says nothing--or, rather, he laughs, and says: 'Oh, well, it will
come out all right in time.He's taken him to ride in his car once, to my
knowledge."Frank Blaisdell has--a car?""Oh, yes, he's just been learning to run it.Jane says he's crazy over
it, and that he's teasing her to go all the time.She says he wants to
be on the move somewhere every minute."Well, no, I--didn't.""Oh yes, he's joined the Hillerton Country Club, and he goes up to the
links every morning for practice.""I can't imagine it--Frank Blaisdell spending his mornings playing
golf!""Frank Blaisdell is a retired
business man.He has begun to take some pleasure in life now."Smith, as he turned to go into his own room.Smith called on the Frank Blaisdells that evening.Blaisdell
took him out to the garage (very lately a barn), and showed him the
shining new car.He also showed him his lavish supply of golf clubs,
and told him what a "bully time" he was having these days.He told him,
too, all about his Western trip, and said there was nothing like travel
to broaden a man's outlook.He said a great deal about how glad he was
to get out of the old grind behind the counter--but in the next breath
he asked Mr.Smith if he had ever seen a store run down as his had done
since he left it.Donovan didn't know any more than a cat how such a
store should be run, he said.When they came back from the garage they found callers in the
living-room.Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord were chatting with
Mellicent.Almost at once the doorbell rang, too, and Donald Gray came
in with his violin and a roll of music.Mellicent's mother came in
also.She greeted all the young men pleasantly, and asked Carl Pennock
to tell Mr.Then she sat down by
young Gray and asked him many questions about his music.She was SO
interested in violins, she said.Gray waxed eloquent, and seemed wonderfully pleased--for about five
minutes; then Mr.Smith saw that his glance was shifting more and more
frequently and more and more unhappily to Mellicent and Hibbard
Gaylord, talking tennis across the room.Smith apparently lost interest in young Pennock's fish story then.At all events, another minute found him eagerly echoing Mrs.Blaisdell's interest in violins--but with this difference: violins in
the abstract with her became A violin in the concrete with him; and he
must hear it at once.Jane herself could not have told exactly how it was done, but she
knew that two minutes later young Gray and Mellicent were at the piano,
he, shining-eyed and happy, drawing a tentative bow across the strings:
she, no less shining-eyed and happy, giving him "A" on the piano.Smith enjoyed the music very much--so much that he begged for
another selection and yet another.Smith did not appear to realize
that Messrs.Pennock and Gaylord were passing through sham interest and
frank boredom to disgusted silence.Jane's efforts to substitute some other form of entertainment for the
violin-playing.He shook hands very heartily, however, with Pennock and
Gaylord when they took their somewhat haughty departure, a little
later, and, strange to say, his interest in the music seemed to go with
their going; for at once then he turned to Mr.Frank Blaisdell
with a very animated account of some Blaisdell data he had found only
the week before.He did not appear to notice that the music of the piano had become
nothing but soft fitful snatches with a great deal of low talk and
laughter between.Blaisdell, and
especially Mrs.Blaisdell, should know the intimate history of one
Ephraim Blaisdell, born in 1720, and his ten children and forty-nine
grandchildren.He talked of various investments then, and of the
weather.He talked of the Blaisdells' trip, and of the cost of railroad
fares and hotel life.Jane told her husband
after he left that Mr.Smith had talked of everything under the sun,
and that she nearly had a fit because she could not get one minute to
herself to break in upon Mellicent and that horrid Gray fellow at the
piano.She had
never remembered he was such a talker!The young people had a tennis match on the school tennis court the next
day.Smith told Miss Maggie that he thought he would drop around
there.He said he liked very much to watch tennis games.Miss Maggie said yes, that she liked to watch tennis games, too.If
this was just a wee bit of a hint, it quite failed of its purpose, for
Mr.Smith did not offer to take her with him.He changed the subject,
indeed, so abruptly, that Miss Maggie bit her lip and flushed a little,
throwing a swift glance into his apparently serene countenance.Miss Maggie herself, in the afternoon, with an errand for an excuse,
walked slowly by the tennis court.Smith at once--but he
did not seem at all interested in the playing.He had his back to the
court, in fact.He was talking very animatedly with Mellicent
Blaisdell.He was still talking with her--though on the opposite side
of the court--when Miss Maggie went by again on her way home.Miss Maggie frowned and said something just under her breath about
"that child--flirting as usual!"Then she went on, walking very fast,
and without another glance toward the tennis ground.But a little
farther on Miss Maggie's step lagged perceptibly, and her head lost its
proud poise.Miss Maggie, for a reason she could not have explained
herself, was feeling suddenly old, and weary, and very much alone.To the image in the mirror as she took off her hat a few minutes later
in her own hall, she said scornfully:

"Well, why shouldn't you feel old?Miss
Maggie had a habit of talking to herself in the mirror--but never
before had she said anything like this to herself.queried Miss Maggie, without looking up
from the stocking she was mending.Why, I don't remember who did win finally," he answered.Nor did it apparently occur to him that for one who was so greatly
interested in tennis, he was curiously uninformed.Smith left the house soon after breakfast, and,
contrary to his usual custom, did not mention where he was going.Miss
Maggie was surprised and displeased.More especially was she displeased
because she WAS displeased.As if it mattered to her where he went, she
told herself scornfully.The next day and the next it was much the same.demanded Jane, without preamble, glancing at the
vacant chair by the table in the corner.Miss Maggie, to her disgust, could feel the color burning in her
cheeks; but she managed to smile as if amused."I don't know, I'm sure."Well, if you were I should ask you to keep him away from Mellicent,"
retorted Mrs."I mean he's been hanging around Mellicent almost every day for a week."Smith is fifty if
he's a day.""I'm not saying he isn't," sniffed Jane, her nose uptilted."But I do
say, 'No fool like an old fool'!"Smith has always been fond
of Mellicent, and--and interested in her.But I don't believe he cares
for her--that way.""Then why does he come to see her and take her auto-riding, and hang
around her every minute he gets a chance?""I know how he
acts at the house, and I hear he scarcely left her side at the tennis
match the other day.""Yes, I--" Miss Maggie did not finish her sentence.A slow change came
to her countenance.The flush receded, leaving her face a bit white."I wonder if the man really thinks he stands any chance," spluttered
Jane, ignoring Miss Maggie's unfinished sentence."Why, he's worse than
that Donald Gray.He not only hasn't got the money, but he's old, as
well.""Yes, we're all--getting old, Jane."Miss Maggie tossed the words off
lightly, and smiled as she uttered them.Jane had gone,
she went to the little mirror above the mantel and gazed at herself
long and fixedly.Then resolutely she turned away, picked up her work,
and fell to sewing very fast.Two days later Mellicent went back to school.To Miss Maggie things seemed to settle back
into their old ways again then.Smith she took drives and
motor-rides, enjoying the crisp October air and the dancing sunlight on
the reds and browns and yellows of the autumnal foliage.True, she used
to wonder sometimes if the end always justified the means--it seemed an
expensive business to hire an automobile to take them fifty miles and
back, and all to verify a single date.And she could not help noticing
that Mr.Smith appeared to have many dates that needed verifying--dates
that were located in very diverse parts of the surrounding country.Miss Maggie also could not help noticing that Mr.Smith was getting
very little new material for his Blaisdell book these days, though he
still worked industriously over the old, retabulating, and recopying.She knew this, because she helped him do it--though she was careful to
let him know that she recognized the names and dates as old
acquaintances.To tell the truth, Miss Maggie did not like to admit, even to herself,
that Mr.Smith must be nearing the end of his task.She did not like to
think of the house--after Mr.She told herself
that he was just the sort of homey boarder that she liked, and she
wished she might keep him indefinitely.She thought so all the more when the long evenings of November brought
a new pleasure; Mr.Smith fell into the way of bringing home books to
read aloud; and she enjoyed that very much.They had long talks, too,
over the books they read.In one there was an old man who fell in love
with a young girl, and married her.Miss Maggie, as certain parts of
this story were read, held her breath, and stole furtive glances into
Mr.When it was finished she contrived to question with
careful casualness, as to his opinion of such a marriage.He said he did not
believe that such a marriage should take place, nor did he believe that
in real life, it would result in happiness.Marriage should be between
persons of similar age, tastes, and habits, he said very decidedly.And
Miss Maggie blushed and said yes, yes, indeed!And that night, when
Miss Maggie gazed at herself in the glass, she looked so happy--that
she appeared to be almost as young as Mellicent herself!CHAPTER XVII

AN AMBASSADOR OF CUPID'S


Christmas again brought all the young people home for the holidays.It
brought, also, a Christmas party at James Blaisdell's home.It was a
very different party, however, from the housewarming of a year before.To begin with, the attendance was much smaller; Mrs.Hattie had been
very exclusive in her invitations this time.She had not invited
"everybody who ever went anywhere."There were champagne, and
cigarettes for the ladies, too.Miss Maggie, who
had not attended any social gathering since Father Duff died, yielded
to Mr.Smith's urgings and said that she would go to this.But Miss
Maggie wished afterward that she had not gone--there were so many, many
features about that party that Miss Maggie did not like.She did not like the champagne nor the cigarettes.She did not like
Bessie's showy, low-cut dress, nor her supercilious airs.She did not
like the look in Fred's eyes, nor the way he drank the champagne.She
did not like Jane's maneuvers to bring Mellicent and Hibbard Gaylord
into each other's company--nor the way Mr.Smith maneuvered to get
Mellicent for himself.Of all these, except the very last, Miss Maggie talked with Mr.Smith
on the way home--yet it was the very last that was uppermost in her
mind, except perhaps, Fred.She did speak of Fred; but because that,
too, was so much to her, she waited until the last before she spoke of
it."You saw Fred, of course," she began then.Short as the word was, it carried a volume of meaning to Miss
Maggie's fearful ears.Smith, it--it isn't true, is it?""You saw him--drinking, then?"I saw some, and I heard--more.He's got in
with Gaylord and the rest of his set at college, and they're a bad
lot--drinking, gambling--no good.""But Fred wouldn't--gamble, Mr.And
he's so ambitious to get ahead!Surely he'd know he couldn't get
anywhere in his studies, if--if he drank and gambled!"I saw him only a minute at the first, and he
didn't look well a bit, to me."I found him in his den just as I did last year.He
didn't look well to me, either.""Not a word--and that's what worries me the most.Last year he talked a
lot about him, and was so proud and happy in his coming success.This
time he never mentioned him; but he looked--bad.""Oh, books, business:--nothing in particular.And he wasn't interested
in what he did say."He's talked with me
quite a lot about--about the way they're living.He doesn't like--so
much fuss and show and society."Hattie would get over all that by this time, after
the newness of the money was worn off."It's worse, if anything," sighed
Miss Maggie, as they ascended the steps at her own door."And Miss Bessie--" he began disapprovingly, then stopped."Now, Miss
Mellicent--" he resumed, in a very different voice.With a rather loud
rattling of the doorknob she was pushing open the door.she cried, hurrying
into the living-room.Smith, hurrying after, evidently forgot to finish his sentence.Miss Maggie did not attend any more of the merrymakings of that holiday
week.It seemed to Miss Maggie, indeed, that Mr.Smith was away nearly every minute of that long week--and it WAS a long
week to Miss Maggie.Even the Martin girls were away many of the
evenings.Miss Maggie told herself that that was why the house seemed
so lonesome.But though Miss Maggie did not participate in the gay doings, she heard
of them.She heard of them on all sides, except from Mr.Smith--and on
all sides she heard of the devotion of Mr.She
concluded that this was the reason why Mr.Smith understood that Mellicent and young
Gray cared for each other, and she had thought that Mr.Smith even
approved of the affair between them.Now to push himself on the scene
in this absurd fashion and try "to cut everybody out," as it was
vulgarly termed--she never would have believed it of Mr.She had considered him to be a man of good sense and good judgment.And
had he not himself said, not so long ago, that he believed lovers
should be of the same age, tastes, and habits?And yet, here now he
was--

And there could be no mistake about it.The Martin girls brought it home as current gossip.Jane was
highly exercised over it, and even Harriet had exclaimed over the
"shameful flirtation Mellicent was carrying on with that man old enough
to be her father!"Besides, did she not see
with her own eyes that Mr.Smith was gone every day and evening, and
that, when he was at home at meal-time, he was silent and preoccupied,
and not like himself at all?And it was such a pity--she had thought so much of Mr.And Miss Maggie looked ill on the last evening of that holiday week
when, at nine o'clock, Mr.Smith found her sitting idle-handed before
the stove in the living-room."Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter with you?"cried the man, in very
evident concern."You don't look like yourself to-night!"I'm just--tired, I guess.In spite of herself Miss Maggie's voice carried a
tinge of something not quite pleasant.Smith, however, did not appear to notice it."Yes, I'm home early for once, thank Heaven!"he half groaned, as he
dropped himself into a chair."It has been a strenuous week for you, hasn't it?"Again the tinge of
something not quite pleasant in Miss Maggie's voice."Yes, but it's been worth it."There was a
vague questioning in his eyes.Obtaining, apparently, however, no
satisfactory answer from Miss Maggie's placid countenance, he turned
away and began speaking again."Well, anyway, I've accomplished what I set out to do.""You-you've ALREADY accomplished it?"She was
gazing at him now with startled, half-frightened eyes.Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter?What makes you look so--so
queer?"Why, nothing--nothing at all," laughed Miss Maggie
nervously, but very gayly."I may have been a little--surprised, for a
moment; but I'm very glad--very.""Why, yes, for--for you.Isn't one always glad when--when a love affair
is--is all settled?"Smith smiled pleasantly, but without
embarrassment."It doesn't matter, of course, only--well, I had hoped
it wasn't too conspicuous.""Oh, but you couldn't expect to hide a thing like that, Mr.Smith,"
retorted Miss Maggie, with what was very evidently intended for an arch
smile."Well, I suppose I couldn't expect to keep a thing like that entirely
in the dark.Still, I don't believe the parties themselves--quite
understood.Of course, Pennock and Gaylord knew that they were kept
effectually away, but I don't believe they realized just how
systematically it was done.I--I can't help being sorry for him.""Certainly; and I should think YOU might give him a little sympathy,"
rejoined Miss Maggie spiritedly."You KNOW how much he cared for
Mellicent."Why, what in the world are you talking about?Wasn't I doing the best I could for them all the time?Of COURSE, it
kept HIM away from her, too, just as it did Pennock and Gaylord; but HE
understood.Besides, he HAD her part of the time.I let him in whenever
it was possible.""Whatever in the world
are YOU talking about?Do you mean to say you were doing this FOR Mr.You didn't suppose it
was for Pennock or Gaylord, did you?Nor for--" He stopped short and
stared at Miss Maggie in growing amazement and dismay."You didn't--you
DIDN'T think--I was doing that--for MYSELF?""Well, of course, I--I--" Miss Maggie was laughing and blushing
painfully, but there was a new light in her eyes."Well, anyway,
everybody said you were!"Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands
into his pockets, as he took a nervous turn about the room.as if, in my position, I'd--How perfectly absurd!"He
wheeled and faced her irritably.Why, I'm not a
marrying man.I don't like--I never saw the woman yet that I--" With
his eyes on Miss Maggie's flushed, half-averted face, he stopped again
abruptly."Well, I'll be--" Even under his breath he did not finish his
sentence; but, with a new, quite different expression on his face, he
resumed his nervous pacing of the room, throwing now and then a quick
glance at Miss Maggie's still averted face."It WAS absurd, of course, wasn't it?"Miss Maggie stirred and spoke
lightly, with the obvious intention of putting matters back into usual
conditions again."But, come, tell me, just what did you do, and how?I'm so interested--indeed, I am!"Smith spoke as if he was thinking of something else
entirely.Smith sat down, but he did not go on speaking
at once."You said--you kept Pennock and Gaylord away," Miss Maggie hopefully
reminded him.Oh, I--it was really very simple--I just monopolized
Mellicent myself, when I couldn't let Donald have her.I
saw very soon that she couldn't cope with her mother alone.And
Gaylord--well, I've no use for that young gentleman."I've been looking him up for some time.Miss Maggie asked other questions--Miss Maggie was manifestly
interested--and Mr.Very soon he said good-night and went to his own room.Miss Maggie, who still felt
self-conscious and embarrassed over her misconception of his attentions
to Mellicent, was more talkative than usual in her nervous attempt to
appear perfectly natural.The fact that she often found his eyes fixed
thoughtfully upon her, and felt them following her as she moved about
the room, did not tend to make her more at ease.At such times she
talked faster than ever--usually, if possible, about some member of the
Blaisdell family: Miss Maggie had learned that Mr.Smith was always
interested in any bit of news about the Blaisdells.It was on such an occasion that she told him about Miss Flora and the
new house."I don't know, really, what I am going to do with her," she said."I
wonder if perhaps you could help me.""Help you?--about Miss Flora?"Can you think of any way to make her contented?"Why, I thought--Don't tell me SHE isn't happy!"There was a
curious note of almost despair in Mr."Hasn't she a new
house, and everything nice to go with it?""Oh, yes--and that's what's the trouble.She feels
smothered and oppressed--as if she were visiting somewhere, and not at
home.You see, Miss Flora has always
lived very simply.She isn't used to maids--and the maid knows it,
which, if you ever employed maids, you would know is a terrible state
of affairs.""Oh, but she--she'll get used to that, in time.""Perhaps," conceded
Miss Maggie, "but I doubt it.Some women would, but not Miss Flora.She
is too inherently simple in her tastes.'Why, it's as bad as always
living in a hotel!''You know on my trip I
was so afraid always I'd do something that wasn't quite right, before
those awful waiters in the dining-rooms, and I was anticipating so much
getting home where I could act natural--and here I've got one in my own
house!'"She says Hattie is
always telling her what is due her position, and that she must do this
and do that.She's being invited out, too, to the Pennocks' and the
Bensons'; and they're worse than the maid, she declares.She says she
loves to 'run in' and see people, and she loves to go to places and
spend the day with her sewing; but that these things where you go and
stand up and eat off a jiggly plate, and see everybody, and not really
see ANYBODY, are a nuisance and an abomination.""Well, she's about right there," chuckled Mr."Yes, I think she is," smiled Miss Maggie; "but that isn't telling me
how to make her contented."Smith, with an irritability that
was as sudden as it was apparently causeless."I didn't suppose you had
to tell any woman on this earth how to be contented--with a hundred
thousand dollars!""It would seem so, wouldn't it?"Smith's eyes to her face in a
keen glance of interrogation."You mean--you'd like the chance to prove it?That you wish YOU had
that hundred thousand?""Oh, I didn't say--that," twinkled Miss Maggie mischievously, turning
away.Jane Blaisdell on
the street."You're just the man I want to see," she accosted him eagerly."Then I'll turn and walk along with you, if I may," smiled Mr."Well, I don't know as you can do anything," she sighed; "but
somebody's got to do something.Could you--DO you suppose you could
interest my husband in this Blaisdell business of yours?"Smith gave a start, looking curiously disconcerted."Why, I--I thought he
was--er--interested in motoring and golf.""Oh, he was, for a time; but it's too cold for those now, and he got
sick of them, anyway, before it did come cold, just as he does of
everything.Well, yesterday he asked a question--something about Father
Blaisdell's mother; and that gave me the idea.DO you suppose you could
get him interested in this ancestor business?It's so nice and quiet, and it CAN'T cost much--not like golf clubs and
caddies and gasoline, anyway."Why, I--I don't know, Mrs."I--I could show him what I have found, of course.""Well, I wish you would, then.Anyway, SOMETHING'S got to be done," she
sighed.And he
isn't a bit well, either.He ate such a lot of rich food and all sorts
of stuff on our trip that he got his stomach all out of order; and now
he can't eat anything, hardly."Well, if his stomach's knocked out I pity him," nodded Mr.You did say so when you first came,
didn't you?Smith PLEASE, if you know any of those health
fads, don't tell them to my husband.He's tried
dozens of them until I'm nearly wild, and I've lost two hired girls
already.One day it'll be no water, and the next it'll be all he can
drink; and one week he won't eat anything but vegetables, and the next
he won't touch a thing but meat and--is it fruit that goes with meat or
cereals?And lately
he's taken to inspecting every bit of meat and groceries that comes
into the house.Why, he spends half his time in the kitchen, nosing
'round the cupboards and refrigerator; and, of course, NO girl will
stand that!That's why I'm hoping, oh, I AM hoping that you can do
SOMETHING with him on that ancestor business.There, here is the
Bensons', where I've got to stop--and thank you ever so much, Mr."All right, I'll try," promised Mr.Smith dubiously, as he lifted his
hat.But he frowned, and he was still frowning when he met Miss Maggie
at the Duff supper-table half an hour later."Well, I've found another one who wants me to tell how to be contented,
though afflicted with a hundred thousand dollars," he greeted her
gloweringly."Yes.--CAN'T a hundred thousand dollars bring any one satisfaction?"Miss Maggie laughed, then into her eyes came the mischievous twinkle
that Mr."Don't blame the poor money," she said then demurely."Blame--the way
it is spent!"CHAPTER XVIII

JUST A MATTER OF BEGGING


True to his promise, Mr.Frank Blaisdell on "the
ancestor business" very soon.Laboriously he got out his tabulated
dates and names and carefully he traced for him several lines of
descent from remote ancestors.Painstakingly he pointed out a "Submit,"
who had no history but the bare fact of her marriage to one Thomas
Blaisdell, and a "Thankful Marsh," who had eluded his every attempt to
supply her with parents.He let it be understood how important these
missing links were, and he tried to inspire his possible pupil with a
frenzied desire to go out and dig them up.He showed some of the
interesting letters he had received from various Blaisdells far and
near, and he spread before him the genealogical page of his latest
"Transcript," and explained how one might there stumble upon the very
missing link he was looking for.He said he didn't care how
many children his great-grandfather had, nor what they died of; and as
for Mrs.Submit and Miss Thankful, the ladies might bury themselves in
the "Transcript," or hide behind that wall of dates and names till
doomsday, for all he cared.He never did like
figures, he said, except figures that represented something worth
while, like a day's sales or a year's profits.Smith ever seen a store run
down as his old one had since he sold out?For that matter, something
must have got into all the grocery stores; for a poorer lot of goods
than those delivered every day at his home he never saw.It was a
disgrace to the trade.He said a good deal more about his grocery store--but nothing whatever
more about his Blaisdell ancestors; so Mr.Smith felt justified in
considering his efforts to interest Mr.Frank Blaisdell in the ancestor
business a failure.It was in February that a certain metropolitan reporter, short for
feature articles, ran up to Hillerton and contributed to his paper, the
following Sunday, a write-up on "The Blaisdells One Year After,"
enlarging on the fine new homes, the motor cars, and the luxurious
living of the three families.And it was three days after this article
was printed that Miss Flora appeared at Miss Maggie's, breathless with
excitement."Just see what I've got in the mail this morning!"she cried to Miss
Maggie, and to Mr.Smith, who had opened the door for her.With trembling fingers she took from her bag a letter, and a small
picture evidently cut from a newspaper."There, see," she panted, holding them out."It's a man in Boston, and
these are his children.He said he knew I must have a real kind heart, and
he's in terrible trouble.He said he saw in the paper about the
wonderful legacy I'd had, and he told his wife he was going to write to
me, to see if I wouldn't help them--if only a little, it would aid them
that much."Miss Maggie had taken the letter and the
picture rather gingerly in her hands.Smith had gone over to the
stove suddenly--to turn a damper, apparently, though a close observer
might have noticed that he turned it back to its former position almost
at once."He's sick, and he lost his position, and
his wife's sick, and two of the children, and one of 'em's lame, and
another's blind.Oh, it was such a pitiful story, Maggie!Why, some
days they haven't had enough to eat--and just look at me, with all my
chickens and turkeys and more pudding every day than I can stuff down!"He didn't ask me to HIRE him for
anything.""No, no, dear, but I mean--did he give you any references, to show that
he was--was worthy and all right," explained Miss Maggie patiently.He told me himself how
things were with him," rebuked Miss Flora indignantly."It's all in the
letter there."But he really ought to have given you SOME reference, dear, if he
asked you for money.""Well, I don't want any reference.I'd be ashamed to
doubt a man like that!And YOU would, after you read that letter, and
look into those blessed children's faces.Besides, he never thought of
such a thing--I know he didn't.Why, he says right in the letter there
that he never asked for help before, and he was so ashamed that he had
to now."[Illustration with caption: "AND LOOK INTO THOSE BLESSED CHILDREN'S
FACES"]

Mr.Smith made a sudden odd little noise in his throat.At all events, he was seized with a fit of coughing just then.Miss Maggie turned over the letter in her hand."Where does he tell you to send the money?""It's right there--Box four hundred and something; and I got a money
order, just as he said."Do you mean that you've already sent this money?"I stopped at the office on the way down here."He said he would rather have that than a check."You don't seem to have--delayed any."Why, Maggie, he said he HAD to have it at
once.He was going to be turned out--TURNED OUT into the streets!Think
of those seven little children in the streets!Why,
Maggie, what can you be thinking of?""I'm thinking you've been the easy victim of a professional beggar,
Flora," retorted Miss Maggie, with some spirit, handing back the letter
and the picture."Why, Maggie, I never knew you to be so--so unkind," charged Miss
Flora, her eyes tearful."He can't be a professional beggar.He SAID he
wasn't--that he never begged before in his life."Miss Maggie, with a despairing gesture, averted her face.Smith, you--YOU don't think so, do you?"Smith grew very red--perhaps because he had to stop to cough again."Well, Miss Flora, I--I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I shall have to agree
with Miss Maggie here, to some extent."You don't know how beautifully he
talked.""You told me; and you say yourself that he gave you only a post-office
box for an address.So you see you couldn't look him up very well."Miss Flora threw back her head a little haughtily."And I'm glad I don't doubt my fellow men and women as you and Maggie
Duff do!If either of you KNEW what you're talking about, I wouldn't
say anything.You CAN'T KNOW anything about this man,
and you didn't ever get letters like this, either of you, of course.But, anyhow, I don't care if he ain't worthy.I wouldn't let those
children suffer; and I--I'm glad I sent it.I never in my life was so
happy as I was on the way here from the post-office this morning."Without waiting for a reply, she turned away majestically; but at the
door she paused and looked back at Miss Maggie."And let me tell you that, however good or bad this particular man may
be, it's given me an idea, anyway," she choked.The haughtiness was all
gone now "I know now why it hasn't seemed right to be so happy.It's
because there are so many other folks in the world that AREN'T happy.Why, my chicken and turkey would choke me now if I didn't give some of
it to--to all these others.And I'm going to--I'M GOING TO!"she
reiterated, as she fled from the room.As the door shut crisply, Miss Maggie turned and looked at Mr.Smith had crossed again to the stove and was fussing with the
damper.Miss Maggie, after a moment's hesitation, turned and went out
into the kitchen, without speaking.Smith and Miss Maggie saw very little of Miss Flora after this for
some time.They heard of her
generous gifts to families all over town.A turkey was sent to every house on Mill Street, without exception, and
so much candy given to the children that half of them were made ill,
much to the distress of Miss Flora, who, it was said, promptly sent a
physician to undo her work.The Dow family, hard-working and thrifty,
and the Nolans, notorious for their laziness and shiftlessness, each
received a hundred dollars outright.The Whalens, always with both
hands metaphorically outstretched for alms, were loud in their praises
of Miss Flora's great kindness of heart; but the Davises (Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's impecunious relatives) had very visible difficulty in
making Miss Flora understand that gifts bestowed as she bestowed them
were more welcome unmade.Every day, from one quarter or another, came stories like these to the
ears of Miss Maggie and Mr.Then one day, about a month later, she appeared as before at the Duff
cottage, breathless and agitated; only this time, plainly, she had been
crying."Why, Flora, what in the world is the matter?"cried Miss Maggie, as
she hurried her visitor into a comfortable chair and began to unfasten
her wraps.Oh, he ain't here, is he?"she lamented, with a
disappointed glance toward the vacant chair by the table in the corner."I thought maybe he could help me, some way.I won't go to Frank, or
Jim.They've--they've said so many things.I'll call him,"
comforted Miss Maggie, taking off Miss Flora's veil and hat and
smoothing back her hair."But you don't want him to find you crying
like this, Flora."Yes, yes, I know, but I'm not crying--I mean, I won't any more.And
I'll tell you just as soon as you get Mr.It's only that I've
been--so silly, I suppose.Miss Maggie, still with the disturbed frown between her eyebrows,
summoned Mr.Then together they sat down to hear Miss Flora's
story."It all started, of course, from--from that day I brought the letter
here--from that man in Boston with seven children, you know.""Yes, I remember," encouraged Miss Maggie."Well, I--I did quite a lot of things after that.I was so glad and
happy to discover I could do things for folks.It seemed to--to take
away the wickedness of my having so much, you know; and so I gave food
and money, oh, lots of places here in town--everywhere,'most, that I
could find that anybody needed it."We heard of the many kind things you did, dear."Miss
Maggie had the air of one trying to soothe a grieved child."But they didn't turn out to be kind--all of 'em," quavered Miss Flora.I TRIED to do 'em all right!""I know; but 'tain't those I came to talk about.I got 'em--lots of 'em--after the first one--the one you saw.First I got one, then another and another, till lately I've been
getting 'em every day,'most, and some days two or three at a time.""And they all wanted--money, I suppose," observed Mr.Smith, "for their
sick wives and children, I suppose.""Oh, not for children always--though it was them a good deal.But it
was for different things--and such a lot of them!I never knew there
could be so many kinds of such things.And I was real pleased, at
first,--that I could help, you know, in so many places.""Then you always sent it--the money?"Why, I just had to, the way they wrote; I wanted to, too.They wrote lovely letters, and real interesting ones, too.One man
wanted a warm coat for his little girl, and he told me all about what
hard times they'd had.Another wanted a brace for his poor little
crippled boy, and HE told me things.Why, I never s'posed folks could
have such awful things, and live!One woman just wanted to borrow
twenty dollars while she was so sick.She didn't ask me to give it to
her.Don't you suppose I'd send her that money?And there was a poor blind man--he wanted money to buy
a Bible in raised letters; and of COURSE I wouldn't refuse that!Some
didn't beg; they just wanted to sell things.I bought a diamond ring to
help put a boy through school, and a ruby pin of a man who needed the
money for bread for his children.And there was--oh, there was lots of
'em--too many to tell.""And all from Boston, I presume," murmured Mr."Oh, no,--why, yes, they were, too, most of 'em, when you come to think
of it."No, I haven't finished," moaned Miss Flora, almost crying again."And
now comes the worst of it.As I said, at first I liked it--all these
letters--and I was so glad to help.But they're coming so fast now I
don't know what to do with 'em.And I never saw such a lot of things as
they want--pensions and mortgages, and pianos, and educations, and
wedding dresses, and clothes to be buried in, and--and there were so
many, and--and so queer, some of 'em, that I began to be afraid maybe
they weren't quite honest, all of 'em, and of course I CAN'T send to
such a lot as there are now, anyway, and I was getting so worried.Besides, I got another one of those awful proposals from those dreadful
men that want to marry me.As if I didn't know THAT was for my money!Then to-day, this morning, I--I got the worst of all."From her bag she
took an envelope and drew out a small picture of several children, cut
apparently from a newspaper."Why, no,--yes, it's the one you brought us a month ago, isn't it?"The one I showed you before is in my bureau drawer
at home.But I got it out this morning, when this one came, and
compared them; and they're just exactly alike--EXACTLY!""Oh, he wrote again, then,--wants more money, I suppose," frowned Miss
Maggie.This man's name is Haley, and
that one was Fay.Haley says this is a picture of his children,
and he says that the little girl in the corner is Katy, and she's deaf
and dumb; but Mr.Fay said her name was Rosie, and that she was LAME.And all the others--their names ain't the same, either, and there ain't
any of 'em blind.And, of course, I know now that--that one of those
men is lying to me.Why, they cut them out of the same newspaper;
they've got the same reading on the back!And I--I don't know what to
believe now.And there are all those letters at home that I haven't
answered yet; and they keep coming--why, I just dread to see the
postman turn down our street.I didn't
like his first letter and didn't answer it; and now he says if I don't
send him the money he'll tell everybody everywhere what a stingy
t-tight-wad I am.And another man said he'd come and TAKE it if I
didn't send it; and you KNOW how afraid of burglars I am!Oh what shall
I do, what shall I do?""First, don't you worry another bit,
Miss Flora.Second, just hand those letters over to me--every one of
them.Most rich people have to have secretaries,
you know.""But how'll you know how to answer MY letters?"demanded Miss Flora
dubiously."N-no, not exactly a secretary.But--I've had some experience with
similar letters," observed Mr.I hoped maybe you
could help me some way, but I never thought of that--your answering
'em, I mean.I supposed everybody had to answer their own letters.How'll you know what I want to say?""I shan't be answering what YOU want to say--but what _I_ want to say.In this case, Miss Flora, I exceed the prerogatives of the ordinary
secretary just a bit, you see.But you can count on one thing--I shan't
be spending any money for you.""You won't send them anything, then?"Smith, I want to send some of 'em something!"Of course you do, dear," spoke up Miss Maggie."But you aren't being
either kind or charitable to foster rascally fakes like that," pointing
to the picture in Miss Flora's lap."I'd stake my life on most of 'em," declared Mr."They have all
the earmarks of fakes, all right.""But I was having a beautiful time giving until these horrid letters
began to come.""Flora, do you give because YOU like the sensation of giving, and of
receiving thanks, or because you really want to help somebody?"asked
Miss Maggie, a bit wearily."Why, Maggie Duff, I want to help people, of course," almost wept Miss
Flora."Well, then, suppose you try and give so it will help them, then," said
Miss Maggie."One of the most risky things in the world, to my way of
thinking, is a present of--cash.Y-yes, of course," stammered Mr.Smith, growing
suddenly, for some unapparent reason, very much confused.Smith finished speaking, he threw an oddly nervous glance
into Miss Maggie's face.But Miss Maggie had turned back to Miss Flora."There, dear," she admonished her, "now, you do just as Mr.Just hand over your letters to him for a while, and forget all about
them.He'll tell you how he answers them, of course.But you won't have
to worry about them any more.Besides they'll soon stop coming,--won't
they, Mr.They'll dwindle to a few scattering ones,
anyway,--after I've handled them for a while.""Well, I should like that," sighed Miss Flora."But--can't I give
anything anywhere?""But I would investigate a
little, first, dear.Smith threw a swiftly questioning
glance into Miss Maggie's face."Yes, oh, yes; I believe in--investigation," he said then."And now,
Miss Flora," he added briskly, as Miss Flora reached for her wraps,
"with your kind permission I'll walk home with you and have a look
at--my new job of secretarying."CHAPTER XIX

STILL OTHER FLIES


It was when his duties of secretaryship to Miss Flora had dwindled to
almost infinitesimal proportions that Mr.Smith wished suddenly that he
were serving Miss Maggie in that capacity, so concerned was he over a
letter that had come to Miss Maggie in that morning's mail.He himself had taken it from the letter-carrier's hand and had placed
it on Miss Maggie's little desk.Casually, as he did so, he had noticed
that it bore a name he recognized as that of a Boston law firm; but he
had given it no further thought until later, when, as he sat at his
work in the living-room, he had heard Miss Maggie give a low cry and
had looked up to find her staring at the letter in her hand, her face
going from red to white and back to red again."Why, Miss Maggie, what is it?"As she turned toward him he saw that her eyes were full of tears."Why, it--it's a letter telling me---" She stopped abruptly, her eyes
on his face."Yes, yes, tell me," he begged."Why, you are--CRYING, dear!"Smith, plainly quite unaware of the caressing word he had used, came
nearer, his face aglow with sympathy, his eyes very tender.The red surged once more over Miss Maggie's face.She drew back a
little, though manifestly with embarrassment, not displeasure."It's--nothing, really it's nothing," she stammered."It's just a
letter that--that surprised me.""Oh, well, I--I cry easily sometimes."With hands that shook visibly,
she folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope.Then with a
carelessness that was a little too elaborate, she tossed it into her
open desk.Very plainly, whatever she had meant to do in the first
place, she did not now intend to disclose to Mr."Miss Maggie, please tell me--was it bad news?"Smith thought he detected a break very like a sob in the laugh."But maybe I could--help you," he pleaded."You couldn't--indeed, you couldn't!""Miss Maggie, was it--money matters?"He had his answer in the telltale color that flamed instantly into her
face--but her lips said:--

"It was--nothing--I mean, it was nothing that need concern you."She
hurried away then to the kitchen, and Mr.Smith was left alone to fume
up and down the room and frown savagely at the offending envelope
tiptilted against the ink bottle in Miss Maggie's desk, just as Miss
Maggie's carefully careless hand had thrown it.Miss Maggie had several more letters from the Boston law firm, and Mr.Smith knew it--though he never heard Miss Maggie cry out at any of the
other ones.That they affected her deeply, however, he was certain.Her
very evident efforts to lead him to think that they were of no
consequence would convince him of their real importance to her if
nothing else had done so.He watched her, therefore, covertly,
fearfully, longing to help her, but not daring to offer his services.That the affair had something to do with money matters he was sure.That she would not deny this naturally strengthened him in this belief.He came in time, therefore, to formulate his own opinion: she had lost
money--perhaps a good deal (for her), and she was too proud to let him
or any one else know it.He watched then all the more carefully to see if he could detect any
NEW economies or new deprivations in her daily living.Then, because he
could not discover any such, he worried all the more: if she HAD lost
that money, she ought to economize, certainly.Could she be so foolish
as to carry her desire for secrecy to so absurd a length as to live
just exactly as before when she really could not afford it?Smith requested to have hot water
brought to his room morning and night, for which service he insisted,
in spite of Miss Maggie's remonstrances, on paying three dollars a week
extra.There came a strange man to call one day.He was a member of the Boston
law firm.Smith found out that much, but no more.Miss Maggie was
almost hysterical after his visit.She talked very fast and laughed a
good deal at supper that night; yet her eyes were full of tears nearly
all the time, as Mr."And I suppose she thinks she's hiding it from me--that her heart is
breaking!"Smith savagely to himself, as he watched Miss
Maggie's nervous efforts to avoid meeting his eyes."I vow I'll have it
out of her.I'll have it out--to-morrow!"Smith did not "have it out" with Miss Maggie the following day,
however.Something entirely outside of himself sent his thoughts into a
new channel.He was alone in the Duff living-room, and was idling over his work, at
his table in the corner, when Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell opened the door and
hurried in, wringing her hands.Smith sprang to his feet and hastened toward her."Oh, I don't know--I don't know," moaned the woman, flinging herself
into a chair."There can't anybody do anything, I s'pose; but I've GOT
to have somebody.I can't stay there in that house--I can't--I can't--I
CAN'T!"And you shan't," soothed the man."And she'll
be here soon, I'm sure--Miss Maggie will.But just let me help you off
with your things," he urged, somewhat awkwardly trying to unfasten her
heavy wraps.Impatiently she jerked off the rich fur coat and
tossed it into his arms; then she dropped into the chair again and fell
to wringing her hands."Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"Can't I send for--for your husband?"Blaisdell fell to weeping afresh.He's gone--to Fred, you know.""Yes, yes, that's what's the matter.Blaisdell, I'm so sorry!The woman dropped her hands from her face and looked up wildly, half
defiantly.He isn't bad and
wicked, is he?And they can't shut him up if--if we pay it back--all of
it that he took?They won't take my boy--to PRISON?"Smith's face, she began to wring her hands
again.I'll have to tell you--I'll have to," she
moaned."But, my dear woman,--not unless you want to.""I do want to--I do want to!With a visible effort she calmed herself a little and forced
herself to talk more coherently.He wanted seven hundred
dollars and forty-two cents.He said he'd got to have it--if he didn't,
he'd go and KILL himself.He said he'd spent all of his allowance,
every cent, and that's what made him take it--this other money, in the
first place.""You mean--money that didn't belong to him?""Yes; but you mustn't blame him, you mustn't blame him, Mr."Yes; and--Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what shall I do?she
broke off wildly, leaping to her feet as Miss Maggie pushed open the
door and hurried in.Miss Maggie,
white-faced, but with a cheery smile, was throwing off her heavy coat
and her hat.A moment later she came over and took Mrs.Hattie's
trembling hands in both her own."Now, first, tell me all about it,
dear.""Only a little," answered Miss Maggie, gently pushing the other back
into her chair.Jim telephoned him something, just before
he left.She began to wring her hands again, but
Miss Maggie caught and held them firmly."You see, Fred, he was
treasurer of some club, or society, or something; and--and he--he
needed some money to--to pay a man, and he took that--the money that
belonged to the club, you know, and he thought he could pay it back,
little by little.But something happened--I don't know what--a new
treasurer, or something: anyhow, it was going to be found out--that
he'd taken it.It was going to be found out to-morrow, and so he wrote
the letter to his father.But he looked so--oh, I never
saw him look so white and terrible.And I'm so afraid--of what he'll
do--to Fred."Is Jim going to give him the money?"And he's going to give it to him.Oh, they can't shut him
up--they CAN'T send him to prison NOW, can they?"No, they won't send him to prison.If Jim has gone with
the money, Fred will pay it back and nobody will know it.But, Hattie,
Fred DID it, just the same.""And, Hattie, don't you see?Don't you
see where all this is leading?But he isn't going to, any more.He said if his father would help him out of this
scrape, he'd never get into another one, and he'd SHOW him how much he
appreciated it."I'm glad to hear that," cried Miss Maggie."He'll come out all
right, yet."Smith, over at the window, blew his nose
vigorously.Smith had not sat down since Miss Maggie's entrance.He
had crossed to the window, and had stood looking out--at nothing--all
through Mrs."You do think he will, don't you?"Hattie, turning from one
to the other piteously."He said he was ashamed of himself; that this
thing had been an awful lesson to him, and he promised--oh, he promised
lots of things, if Jim would only go up and help him out of this.He'd
never, never have to again.But he will, I know he will, if that
Gaylord fellow stays there.The whole thing was his fault--I know it
was."Why, Hattie, I thought you liked them!"They're mean, stuck-up things, and they snub me awfully.Don't you suppose I know when I'm being snubbed?And that Gaylord
girl--she's just as bad, and she's making my Bessie just like her.I
got Bess into the same school with her, you know, and I was so proud
and happy.Why, my Bess, my own daughter,
actually looks down on us.She's ashamed of her own father and
mother--and she shows it.And it's that Gaylord girl that's done it,
too, I believe.I thought I--I was training my daughter to be a lady--a
real lady; but I never meant to train her to look down on--on her own
mother!""I'm afraid Bessie--needs something of a lesson," commented Miss Maggie
tersely."But Bessie will be older, one of these days, Hattie, and then
she'll--know more.""But that's what I've been trying to teach her--'more,' something more
all the time, Maggie," sighed Mrs."And I've
tried to remember and call her Elizabeth, too.--but I can't.But,
somehow, to-day, nothing seems of any use, any way.And even if she
learns more and more, I don't see as it's going to do any good.I'm not fine enough yet, it seems, for
Mrs.They don't want me among them, and
they show it.And all my old friends are so envious and jealous since
the money came that THEY don't want me, and THEY show it; so I don't
feel comfortable anywhere.""Never mind, dear, just stop trying to live as you think other folks
want you to live, and live as YOU want to, for a while."Hattie smiled faintly, wiped her eyes again, and got to her feet."Well, just try it," smiled Miss Maggie, helping her visitor into the
luxurious fur coat."You've no idea how much more comfort you'll take."Hattie's eyes were wistful, but almost instantly they
showed an alert gleam of anger."Well, anyhow, I'm not going to try to do what those Gaylords do any
longer.And--and you're SURE Fred won't have to go to prison?""I'm very sure," nodded Miss Maggie.You always make
me feel better, Maggie, and you, too, Mr."Now, go home and go to bed, and don't
worry any more or you'll have one of your headaches."As the door closed behind her visitor, Miss Maggie turned and sank into
a chair.She looked worn and white, and utterly weary."I hope she won't meet Frank or Jane anywhere."Do you think they'd blame her--about this
unfortunate affair of Fred's?"I just
came from Frank's, and--"

"Yes?"Something in her face sent a questioning frown to Mr."Do you remember hearing Flora say that Jane had bought a lot of the
Benson gold-mine stock?""Well, Benson has failed; and they've just found out that that
gold-mine stock is worth--about two cents on a dollar."And how much--"

"About forty thousand dollars," said Miss Maggie wearily."Well, I'll be--"

He did not finish his sentence.CHAPTER XX

FRANKENSTEIN: BEING A LETTER FROM JOHN SMITH TO EDWARD D. NORTON,
ATTORNEY AT LAW


DEAR NED:--Wasn't there a story written once about a fellow who created
some sort of a machine man without any soul that raised the very
dickens and all for him?Frank--Frankenstein?--I guess that was it.Well, I've created a Frankenstein creature--and I'm dead up against it
to know what to do with him.Ned, what in Heaven's name am I going to do with Mr.John Smith, let me tell you, is a very healthy, persistent, insistent,
important person, with many kind friends, a definite position in the
world, and no small degree of influence.Worse yet (now prepare for a
stunning blow, Ned!Smith has been so inconsiderate as to fall in
love.And he has fallen in love as absolutely and as
idiotically as if he were twenty-one instead of fifty-two.Now, will
you kindly tell me how Mr.John Smith is going to fade away into
nothingness?And, even if he finds the way to do that, shall he, before
fading, pop the question for Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, or shall he trust
to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's being able to win for himself the love Mr.Seriously, joking aside, I'm afraid I've made a mess of things, not
only for myself, but for everybody else.I'll spare you rhapsodies, Ned.They say, anyway,
that there's no fool like an old fool.But I will admit that that
future looks very dark to me if I am not to have the companionship of
the little woman, Maggie Duff.Oh, yes, it's "Poor Maggie."As for Miss Maggie herself, perhaps it's
conceited, but I believe she's not entirely indifferent to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton I have my doubts; but,
alas!I have no doubts whatever as to what her opinion will be of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's masquerading as Mr.Stanley G. Fulton the job he's got on his hands to put himself
right with her, either.But there's one thing he can be sure of, at
least; if she does care for Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton's money that was the bait.you see already I have adopted the Hillerton
vernacular.)But I fear Miss Maggie is indeed "poor" now.She has had
several letters that I don't like the looks of, and a call from a
villainous-looking man from Boston--one of your craft, I believe
(begging your pardon).I think she's lost some money, and I don't
believe she had any extra to lose.She's as proud as Lucifer, however,
and she's determined no one shall find out she's lost any money, so her
laugh is gayer than ever.I can hear
something in her voice that isn't laughter.Ned, what a mess I HAVE made of it!I feel more than ever now
like the boy with his ear to the keyhole.These people are my
friends--or, rather, they are Mr.As for being
mine--who am I, Smith, or Fulton?Will they be Fulton's friends, after
they find he is John Smith?Will they be Smith's friends, even, after
they find he is Fulton?Oh, yes, I can hear you say that it serves me right, and that you
warned me, and that I was deaf to all remonstrances.Now, we'll waste no more time on that.I've acknowledged my error, and my transgression is ever
before me.I built the box, I walked into it, and I deliberately shut
the cover down.I've got to get out--some
way.I can't spend the rest of my natural existence as John Smith,
hunting Blaisdell data--though sometimes I think I'd be willing to, if
it's the only way to stay with Miss Maggie.I tell you, that little
woman can make a home out of--

But I couldn't stay with Miss Maggie.John Smith wouldn't have money
enough to pay his board, to say nothing of inviting Miss Maggie to
board with him, would he?Stanley G. Fulton's last
will and testament on the first day of next November will effectually
cut off Mr.There is no provision in the
will for Mr.I don't think
he'd like that.By the way, I wonder: do you suppose John Smith could
earn--his salt, if he was hard put to it?Very plainly, then, something
has got to be done about getting John Smith to fade away, and Stanley
G. Fulton to appear before next November.And I had thought it would be so easy!Early this summer John Smith was
to pack up his Blaisdell data, bid a pleasant adieu to Hillerton, and
betake himself to South America.In due course, after a short trip to
some obscure Inca city, or down some little-known river, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton would arrive at some South American hotel from the interior, and
would take immediate passage for the States, reaching Chicago long
before November first.There would be a slight flurry, of course, and a few annoying
interviews and write-ups; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton always was known to
keep his affairs to himself pretty well, and the matter would soon be
put down as merely another of the multi-millionaire's eccentricities.The whole thing would then be all over, and well over.But--nowhere had
there been taken into consideration the possibilities of--a Maggie
Duff.And now, to me, that same Maggie Duff is the only thing worth
considering--anywhere.And even after all this, I haven't accomplished what I set out to
do--that is, find the future possessor of the Fulton millions (unless
Miss Maggie--bless her!--says "yes."And even then, some one will have
to have them after us).As
conditions are now, I should not want either Frank, or James, or Flora
to have them--not unless the millions could bring them more happiness
than these hundred thousand apiece have brought.Honest, Ned, that miserable money has made more--But, never mind.It's
too long a story to write.I'll tell you when I see you--if I ever do
see you.There's still the possibility, you know, that Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton is lost in darkest South America, and of course John Smith CAN
go to work!I believe I won't sign any name--I haven't got any name--that I feel
really belongs to me now.Still I might--yes, I will sign it

                                        "FRANKENSTEIN."CHAPTER XXI

SYMPATHIES MISPLACED


The first time Mr.Smith saw Frank Blaisdell, after Miss Maggie's news
of the forty-thousand-dollar loss, he tried, somewhat awkwardly, to
express his interest and sympathy.But Frank Blaisdell cut him short."That's all right, and I thank you," he cried heartily."And I know
most folks would think losing forty thousand dollars was about as bad
as it could be.Jane, now, is all worked up over it; can't sleep
nights, and has gone back to turning down the gas and eating sour cream
so's to save and help make it up.But me--I call it the best thing that
ever happened."Smith; "I'm sure that's a very delightful
way to look at it--if you can.""Well, I can; and I'll tell you why.It's put me back where I
belong--behind the counter of a grocery store.Oh, I had enough left for that, and more!Gorry, but I was glad to feel the old floor under my feet again!""But I thought you--you were tired of work, and--wanted to enjoy
yourself," stammered Mr."Tired of work--wanted to enjoy myself, indeed!Yes, I know I did say
something like that.But, let me tell you this, Mr.Talk about
work!--I never worked so hard in my life as I have the last ten months
trying to enjoy myself.How these folks can stand gadding 'round the
country week in and week out, feeding their stomachs on a French
dictionary instead of good United States meat and potatoes and squash,
and spending their days traipsing off to see things they ain't a mite
interested in, and their nights trying to get rested so they can go and
see some more the next day, I don't understand.""I'm afraid these touring agencies wouldn't like to have you write
their ads for them, Mr."Well, they hadn't better ask me to," smiled the other grimly.Since I come back I've been working even harder trying
to enjoy myself here at home--knockin' silly little balls over a
ten-acre lot in a game a healthy ten-year-old boy would scorn to play.""Oh, yes, I enjoyed the riding well enough; but I didn't enjoy hunting
for punctures, putting on new tires, or burrowing into the inside of
the critter to find out why she didn't go!And that's what I was doing
most of the time.He paused a moment, then went on a little wistfully:--

"I suspect, Mr.Smith, there ain't anything in my line but groceries.If--if I had my life to
live over again, I'd do different, maybe.I'd see if I couldn't find
out what there was in a picture to make folks stand and stare at it an
hour at a time when you could see the whole thing in a minute--and it
wa'n't worth lookin' at, anyway, even for a minute.Now, I like a good tune what is a tune; but them caterwaulings and
dirges that that chap Gray plays on that fiddle of his--gorry, Mr.Smith, I'd rather hear the old barn door at home squeak any day.But if
I was younger I'd try to learn to like 'em.She can set by the hour in front of that phonygraph of hers, and
not know it!""And there's books, too," resumed the other, still wistfully."I'd read
books--if I could stay awake long enough to do it--and I'd find out
what there was in 'em to make a good sensible man like Jim Blaisdell
daft over 'em--and Maggie Duff, too.Why, that little woman used to go
hungry sometimes, when she was a girl, so she could buy a book she
wanted.Why, I'd 'a' given anything this last year if I
could 'a' got interested--really interested, readin'.I could 'a'
killed an awful lot of time that way.I bought a
lot of 'em, too, an' tried it; but I expect I didn't begin young
enough.Smith, I've about come to the conclusion that
there ain't a thing in the world so hard to kill as time.I've tried
it, and I know.Why, I got so I couldn't even kill it EATIN'--though I
'most killed myself TRYIN' to!A full
stomach ain't in it with bein' hungry an' knowing a good dinner's
coming.Why, there was whole weeks at a time back there that I didn't
know the meaning of the word 'hungry.'You'd oughter seen the jolt I
give one o' them waiter-chaps one day when he comes up with his paper
and his pencil and asks me what I wanted.'There ain't
but one thing on this earth I want, and you can't give it to me.I'm tired of bein' so blamed satisfied all the
time!'""And what did--Alphonso say to that?"Oh, the waiter-fellow, you mean?Oh, he just stared a
minute, then mumbled his usual 'Yes, sir, very good, sir,' and shoved
that confounded printed card of his a little nearer to my nose.I guess you've heard enough of this, Mr.It's only that I
was trying to tell you why I'm actually glad we lost that money.It's
give me back my man's job again."I won't waste any more sympathy on you,"
laughed Mr.I hope it'll give me
back a little of my old faith in my fellow-man."I won't suspect every man, woman, and child that says a
civil word to me now of having designs on my pocketbook.Smith, you wouldn't believe it, if I told you, the things that's been
done and said to get a little money out of me.Of course, the open
gold-brick schemes I knew enough to dodge,'most of 'em (unless you
count in that darn Benson mining stock), and I spotted the blackmailers
all right, most generally.But I WAS flabbergasted when a WOMAN tackled
the job and began to make love to me--actually make love to me!--one
day when Jane's back was turned.DO I look such a fool as that,
Mr.Well, anyhow, there won't be any more of that kind, nor
anybody after my money now, I guess," he finished with a sage wag of
his head as he turned away.Smith said, after recounting the
earlier portion of the conversation: "So you see you were right, after
all.Frank Blaisdell had plenty to
retire upon, but nothing to retire to.But I'm glad--if he's happy now.""And he isn't the only one that that forty-thousand-dollar loss has
done a good turn to," nodded Miss Maggie."Mellicent has just been
here.It's the Easter vacation,
anyway, but she isn't going back.Miss Maggie spoke with studied casualness, but there was an added color
in her cheeks--Miss Maggie always flushed a little when she mentioned
Mellicent's name to Mr.Smith, in spite of her indignant efforts not to
do so.Well, the Pennocks had a dance last night, and Mellicent went.She said she had to laugh to see Mrs.Pennock's efforts to keep Carl
away from her--the loss of the money is known everywhere now, and has
been greatly exaggerated, I've heard.She said that even Hibbard
Gaylord had the air of one trying to let her down easy.Mellicent was
immensely amused."He doesn't move in the Pennock crowd much.But
Mellicent sees him, and--and everything's all right there, now.That's
why Mellicent is so happy.""You mean--Has her mother given in?"You see, Jane was at the dance, too, and she saw Carl, and she
saw Hibbard Gaylord.She told Mellicent this
morning that she had her opinion of fellows who would show so plainly
as Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord did that it was the money they were
after."Jane has changed her shoes again," murmured Mr.Miss Maggie's puzzled frown gave way to a laugh."Well, yes, perhaps the shoe is on the other foot again.But, anyway,
she doesn't love Carl or Hibbard any more, and she does love Donald
Gray.He HASN'T let the loss of the money make any difference to him,
you see.He's been even more devoted, if anything.She told Mellicent
this morning that he was a very estimable young man, and she liked him
very much.Perhaps you see now why Mellicent is--happy."I'm glad to know it," cried Mr."I'm glad--" His
face changed suddenly."I'm glad the LOSS of the
money brought them some happiness--if the possession of it didn't," he
finished moodily, turning to go to his own room.At the hall door he
paused and looked back at Miss Maggie, standing by the table, gazing
after him with troubled eyes."Did Mellicent say--whether Fred was
there?"He didn't come home for this vacation
at all.I suspect Mellicent doesn't know
anything about that wretched affair of his."So the young gentleman didn't show up at all?"Hattie didn't
go to the Pennocks' either.Hattie has--has been very different since
this affair of Fred's.I think it frightened her terribly--it was so
near a tragedy; the boy threatened to kill himself, you know, if his
father didn't help him out.""Yes, I know he did; and I'm afraid he found things in a pretty bad
mess--when he got there," sighed Miss Maggie."It was a bad mess all
around.""It is, indeed, a bad mess all around," he growled as he
disappeared through the door.Behind him, Miss Maggie still stood motionless, looking after him with
troubled eyes.As the spring days grew warmer, Miss Maggie had occasion many times to
look after Mr.One day he would be the old delightful companion, genial,
cheery, generously donating a box of chocolates to the center-table
bonbon dish or a dozen hothouse roses to the mantel vase.The next, he
would be nervous, abstracted, almost irritable.Yet she could see no
possible reason for the change.Sometimes she wondered fearfully if Mellicent could have anything to do
with it.Was it possible that he had cared for Mellicent, and to see
her now so happy with Donald Gray was more than he could bear?There was his own statement that he had devoted
himself to her solely and only to help keep the undesirable lovers away
and give Donald Gray a chance.Besides, had he not said that he was not a marrying man, anyway?To be
sure, that seemed a pity--a man so kind and thoughtful and so
delightfully companionable!But then, it was nothing to her, of
course--only she did hope he was not feeling unhappy over Mellicent!Smith would not bring flowers and
candy so often.She felt as if he were spending too
much money--and she had got the impression in some way that he did not
have any too much money to spend.And there were the expensive motor
trips, too--she feared Mr.Yet she could not
tell him so, of course.He never seemed to realize the value of a
dollar, anyway, and he very obviously did not know how to get the most
out of it.Look at his foolish generosity in regard to the board he
paid her!Miss Maggie wondered sometimes if it might not be worry over money
matters that was making him so nervous and irritable on occasions now.Plainly he was very near the end of his work there in Hillerton.He was
not getting so many letters on Blaisdell matters from away, either.For
a month now he had done nothing but a useless repetition of old work;
and of late, a good deal of the time, he was not even making that
pretense of being busy.For days at a time he would not touch his
records.That could mean but one thing, of course; his work was done.Yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure.Not that she
wanted him to go.She should miss him very much when he went, of
course.But she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because
he had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Miss Maggie did not believe in
able-bodied men who had nowhere to go and nothing to do--and she wanted
very much to believe in Mr.She had been under the impression that he was getting the Blaisdell
material together for a book, and that he was intending to publish it
himself.His book must be ready, but he was making no move to
publish it.To Miss Maggie this could mean but one thing: some
financial reverses had made it impossible for him to carry out his
plans, and had left him stranded with no definite aim for the future.She was so sorry!--but there seemed to be nothing that she could do.She HAD tried to help by insisting that he pay less for his board; but
he had not only scouted that idea, but had brought her more chocolates
and flowers than ever--for all the world as if he had divined her
suspicions and wished to disprove them.Smith was trying to keep something from her, Miss Maggie was
sure.She was the more sure, perhaps, because she herself had something
that she was trying to keep from Mr.Smith--and she thought she
recognized the symptoms.Meanwhile April budded into May, and May blossomed into June; and June
brought all the Blaisdells together again in Hillerton.CHAPTER XXII

WITH EVERY JIM A JAMES


Two days after Fred Blaisdell had returned from college, his mother
came to see Miss Maggie.Smith was rearranging the books on Miss
Maggie's shelves and trying to make room for the new ones he had
brought her through the winter.Hattie came in, red-eyed and
flushed-faced, he ceased his work at once and would have left the room,
but she stopped him with a gesture.You know all about it, anyway,--and I'd just as soon you
knew the rest.I just came down to talk
things over with Maggie.I--I'm sure I don't know w-what I'm going to
do--when I can't.""But you always can, dear," soothed Miss Maggie cheerily, handing her
visitor a fan and taking a chair near her.Smith, after a moment's hesitation, turned quietly back to his
bookshelves."Why, Hattie Blaisdell, where are you going?"I
guess we can still see each other.Now, tell me, what does all this
mean?""Well, of course, it began with Fred--his trouble, you know.""But I thought Jim fixed that all up, dear."He paid the money, and nobody there at college knew a
thing about it.Fred told us some of them
night before last.He says he's ashamed of himself, but that he
believes there's enough left in him to make a man of him yet.But he
says he can't do it--there.""You mean--he doesn't want to go back to college?"Miss Maggie's voice
showed her disappointment."Oh, he wants to go to college--but not there.""He says he's had too much money to spend--and that 't wouldn't be easy
not to spend it--if he was back there, in the old crowd."Well, that's all right, isn't it?"He's awfully happy over it, and--and I
guess I am."But now, what is this about Plainville?""Oh, that
grew out of it--all this.Hammond is going to open a new office in
Plainville and he's offered Jim--James--no, JIM--I'm not going to call
him 'James' any more!--the chance to manage it.""Well, that's fine, I'm sure.""Yes, of course that part is fine--splendid.He'll get a bigger salary,
and all that, and--and I guess I'm glad to go, anyway--I don't like
Hillerton any more.I haven't got any friends here, Maggie.Of course,
I wouldn't have anything to do with the Gaylords now, after what's
happened,--that boy getting my boy to drink and gamble, and--and
everything.And yet--YOU know how I've strained every nerve for years,
and worked and worked to get where my children could--COULD be with
them!""It didn't pay, did it, Hattie?"They're perfectly horrid--every one of them, and I
hate them!"Look at what they've done to Fred, and Bessie, too!I
shan't let HER be with them any more, either.There aren't any folks
here we can be with now.That's why I don't mind going away.All our
friends that we used to know don't like us any more, they're so jealous
on account of the money.Oh, yes, I know you think I'm to blame for
that," she went on aggrievedly."I can see you do, by your face.But it was just so I could get ahead.Miss Maggie looked as if she would like to say
something more--but she did not say it.Smith was abstractedly opening and shutting
the book in his hand.He had not
touched the books on the shelves for some time."And look at how I've tried and see what it has come to--Bessie so
high-headed and airy she makes fun of us, and Fred a gambler and a
drunkard, and'most a thief.And it's all that horrid hundred thousand
dollars!"Smith's hand slipped to the floor with a bang; but no
one was noticing Mr."Oh, Hattie, don't blame the hundred thousand dollars," cried Miss
Maggie."Jim says it was, and Fred does, too.Fred said it
was all just the same kind of a way that I'd tried to make folks call
Jim 'James.'He said I'd been trying to make every single 'Jim' we had
into a 'James,' until I'd taken away all the fun of living.And I
suppose maybe he's right, too.""Well,
anyhow, I'm not going to do it any more.There isn't any fun in it,
anyway.It doesn't make any difference how hard I tried to get ahead, I
always found somebody else a little 'aheader' as Benny calls it."There isn't any use--in that kind of trying, Hattie."Jim said I was like the little boy that
they asked what would make him the happiest of anything in the world,
and he answered, 'Everything that I haven't got.'And I suppose I have
been something like that.But I don't see as I'm any worse than other
folks.Everybody goes for money; but I'm sure I don't see why--if it
doesn't make them any happier than it has me!"We shall begin to pack the first of the
month.It looks like a mountain to me, but Jim and Fred say they'll
help, and--"

Mr.Smith did not hear any more, for Miss Maggie and her guest had
reached the hall and had closed the door behind them.But when Miss
Maggie returned, Mr.Smith was pacing up and down the room nervously."Well," he demanded with visible irritation, as soon as she appeared,
"will you kindly tell me if there is anything--desirable--that that
confounded money has done?""You mean--Jim Blaisdell's money?""I mean all the money--I mean the three hundred thousand dollars that
those three people received.Has it ever brought any good or
happiness--anywhere?""Oh, yes, I know," smiled Miss Maggie, a little sadly."But--" Her
countenance changed abruptly.A passionate earnestness came to her
eyes."Don't blame the money--blame the SPENDING of it!The dollar that will buy tickets to the movies will just as
quickly buy a good book; and if you're hungry, it's up to you whether
you put your money into chocolate eclairs or roast beef.Is the MONEY
to blame that goes for a whiskey bill or a gambling debt instead of for
shoes and stockings for the family?"Smith had apparently lost his own irritation in his
amazement at hers."Why, Miss Maggie, you--you seem worked up over this
matter."It's been money,
money, money, ever since I could remember!We're all after it, and we
all want it, and we strain every nerve to get it.We think it's going
to bring us happiness.But it won't--unless we do our part.And there
are some things that even money can't buy.Besides, it isn't the money
that does the things, anyway,--it's the man behind the money.What do
you think money is good for, Mr.Smith, now thoroughly dazed, actually blinked his eyes at the
question, and at the vehemence with which it was hurled into his face."Why, Miss Maggie, it--it--I--I--"

"It isn't good for anything unless we can exchange it for something we
want, is it?""Why, I--I suppose we can GIVE it--"

"But even then we're exchanging it for something we want, aren't we?We
want to make the other fellow happy, don't we?""But it doesn't
always work that way.Now, very likely
this--er--Mr.Fulton thought those three hundred thousand dollars were
going to make these people happy.Personification of happiness--that
woman was, a few minutes ago, wasn't she?"Smith had regained his
air of aggrieved irritation.She
didn't know how to spend it.And that's just what I mean when I say
we've got to do our part--money won't buy happiness, unless we exchange
it for the things that will bring happiness.If we don't know how to
get any happiness out of five dollars, we won't know how to get it out
of five hundred, or five thousand, or five hundred thousand, Mr.I don't mean that we'll get the same amount out of five dollars, of
course,--though I've seen even that happen sometimes!--but I mean that
we've got to know how to spend five dollars--and to make the most of
it.""I reckon--you're right, Miss Maggie.""I know I'm right, and 't isn't the money's fault when things go wrong.Oh, yes, I know--we're taught that the
love of money is the root of all evil.But I don't think it should be
so--necessarily.I think money's one of the most wonderful things in
the world.It's more than a trust and a gift--it's an opportunity, and
a test.It brings out what's strongest in us, every time.And it does
that whether it's five dollars or five hundred thousand dollars.If--if
we love chocolate eclairs and the movies better than roast beef and
good books, we're going to buy them, whether they're chocolate eclairs
and movies on five dollars, or or--champagne suppers and Paris gowns on
five hundred thousand dollars!"Miss Maggie gave a shamefaced laugh and sank back in her chair."You don't know what to think of me, of course; and no wonder," she
sighed."But I've felt so bad over this--this money business right here
under my eyes.I love them all, every one of them.And YOU know how
it's been, Mr.Hasn't it worked out to prove just what I say?She said that Fred declared she'd been
trying to make every one of her 'Jims' a 'James,' ever since the money
came.But he forgot that she did that very same thing before it came.All her life she's been trying to make five dollars look like ten; so
when she got the hundred thousand, it wasn't six months before she was
trying to make that look like two hundred thousand."Jane used to buy ingrain carpets and cheap
chairs and cover them with mats and tidies to save them.""They got on your nerves, too, didn't they?Such layers upon layers of
covers for everything!It brought me to such a pass that I went to the
other extreme.I wouldn't protect ANYTHING--which was very
reprehensible, of course.Well, now she has pretty dishes and solid
silver--but she hides them in bags and boxes, and never uses them
except for company.She doesn't take any more comfort with them than
she did with the ingrain carpets and cheap chairs.Of course, that's a
little thing.When you can't spend five
cents out of a hundred dollars for pleasure without wincing, you
needn't expect you're going to spend five dollars out of a hundred
thousand without feeling the pinch," laughed Miss Maggie."Poor Flora--and when she tried so hard to quiet her conscience because
she had so much money!She told me yesterday that she
hardly ever gets a begging letter now.""No; and those she does get she investigates," asserted Mr."So
the fakes don't bother her much these days.And she's doing a lot of
good, too, in a small way.""She is, and she's happy now," declared Miss Maggie, "except that she
still worries a little because she is so happy.She's dismissed the
maid and does her own work--I'm afraid Miss Flora never was cut out for
a fine-lady life of leisure, and she loves to putter in the kitchen.She says it's such a relief, too, not to keep dressed up in company
manners all the time, and not to have that horrid girl spying 'round
all day to see if she behaves proper.and I reckon it worked the best with her of any of them.""Er--that is, I mean, perhaps she's made the best use of the hundred
thousand," stammered Mr."She's been--er--the happiest.""Why, y-yes, perhaps she has, when you come to look at it that way.""But you wouldn't--er--advise this Mr.Fulton to leave her--his twenty
millions?"laughed Miss Maggie, throwing up both hands."She'd faint dead
away at the mere thought of it."Smith turned on his heel and resumed
his restless pacing up and down the room.From time to time he glanced
furtively at Miss Maggie.Miss Maggie, her hands idly resting in her
lap, palms upward, was gazing fixedly at nothing.he demanded at last, coming to a
pause at her side.Stanley G. Fulton," she answered, not looking
up.The odd something had increased, but Miss Maggie's eyes
were still dreamily fixed on space.I was wondering what he had done with them.""Yes, in the letter, I mean."There was a letter--a second letter to be opened
in two years' time.They said that that was to dispose of the remainder
of the property--his last will and testament.""Oh, yes, I remember," assented Mr.Smith was very carefully not
meeting Miss Maggie's eyes.Miss Maggie turned back to her meditative
gazing at nothing."The two years are nearly up, you know,--I was
talking with Jane the other day--just next November."The words were very near a groan, but at once Mr.Smith
hurriedly repeated, "I know--I know!"very lightly, indeed, with an
apprehensive glance at Miss Maggie."So it seems to me if he were alive that he'd be back by this time.And
so I was wondering--about those millions," she went on musingly."What
do YOU suppose he has done with them?"she asked, with sudden
animation, turning full upon him."Why, I--I--How should I know?"Smith, a swift crimson
dyeing his face."You wouldn't, of course--but that needn't make you look as if I'd
intimated that YOU had them!I was only asking for your opinion, Mr.Smith," she twinkled, with mischievous eyes.Smith laughed now, a little precipitately."But,
indeed, Miss Maggie, you turned so suddenly and the question was so
unexpected that I felt like the small boy who, being always blamed for
everything at home that went wrong, answered tremblingly, when the
teacher sharply demanded, 'Who made the world?''Please, ma'am, I did;
but I'll never do it again!'"Smith, when Miss Maggie had done laughing at his
little story, "suppose I turn the tables on you?Miss Maggie shifted her position, her
face growing intently interested again."I've been trying to remember
what I know of the man.""Yes, from the newspaper and magazine accounts of him.Of course, there
was quite a lot about him at the time the money came; and Flora let me
read some things she'd saved, in years gone.Flora was always
interested in him, you know.""Why, not much, really, about the man.Besides, very likely what I did
find wasn't true.But
I was trying to find out how he'd spent his money himself.I thought
that might give me a clue--about the will, I mean.""Yes; but I didn't find much.In spite of his reported eccentricities,
he seems to me to have done nothing very extraordinary.""He doesn't seem to have been very bad.""Nor very good either, for that matter.""Sort of a--nonentity, perhaps.""Perhaps--though I suppose he couldn't really be that--not very
well--with twenty millions, could he?But I mean, he wasn't very bad,
nor very good.He didn't seem to be dissipated, or mixed up in any
scandal, or to be recklessly extravagant, like so many rich men.On the
other hand, I couldn't find that he'd done any particular good in the
world.Some charities were mentioned, but they were perfunctory,
apparently, and I don't believe, from the accounts, that he ever really
INTERESTED himself in any one--that he ever really cared for--any one."If Miss Maggie had looked up, she would have met a
most disconcerting expression in the eyes bent upon her.But Miss
Maggie did not look up."Why, he didn't even have a wife and
children to stir him from his selfishness.He had a secretary, of
course, and he probably never saw half his begging letters.I can
imagine his tossing them aside with a languid 'Fix them up,
James,--give the creatures what they want, only don't bother me.'"Smith; then, hastily: "I'm sure he never
did."But when I think of what he might
do--Twenty millions!But he didn't
do--anything--worth while with them, so far as I can see, when he was
living, so that's why I can't imagine what his will may be.Probably
the same old perfunctory charities, however, with the Chicago law firm
instead of 'James' as disburser--unless, of course, Hattie's
expectations are fulfilled, and he divides them among the Blaisdells
here.""You think--there's something worth while he MIGHT have done with those
millions, then?"Smith, a sudden peculiar wistfulness in
his eyes."Something he MIGHT have done with them!""Why,
it seems to me there's no end to what he might have done--with twenty
millions."Smith came nearer, his face working with emotion."Miss
Maggie, if a man with twenty millions--that is, could you love a man
with twenty millions, if--if Mr.Fulton should ask you--if _I_ were Mr.Fulton--if--" His countenance changed suddenly.He drew himself up with
a cry of dismay."Oh, no--no--I've spoiled it all now.That isn't what
I meant to say first.I was going to find out--I mean, I was going to
tell--Oh, good Heavens, what a--That confounded money--again!"Smith, w-what--" Only the crisp shutting of the door answered
her.With a beseeching look and a despairing gesture Mr.Then, turning to sit down, she came face to face with her own
image in the mirror."Well, now you've done it, Maggie Duff," she whispered wrathfully to
the reflection in the glass.He was--was
going to say something--I know he was.You've talked money,
money, MONEY to him for an hour.You said you LOVED money; and you told
what you'd do--if you had twenty millions of dollars.And you know--you
KNOW he's as poor as Job's turkey, and that just now he's more than
ever plagued over--money!As
if that counted against--"

With a little sobbing cry Miss Maggie covered her face with her hands
and sat down, helplessly, angrily.CHAPTER XXIII

REFLECTIONS--MIRRORED AND OTHERWISE


Miss Maggie was still sitting in the big chair with her face in her
hands when the door opened and Mr.Miss Maggie, dropping her hands and starting up at his entrance, caught
a glimpse of his face in the mirror in front of her.With a furtive,
angry dab of her fingers at her wet eyes, she fell to rearranging the
vases and photographs on the mantel."Miss Maggie, I've got to face this thing out, of course.Even if I
had--made a botch of things at the very start, it didn't help any
to--to run away, as I did.It was only
because I--I--But never mind that.I'm coming now straight to the
point.Miss Maggie, will you--marry me?"The photograph in Miss Maggie's hand fell face down on the shelf.Miss
Maggie's fingers caught the edge of the mantel in a convulsive grip.A
swift glance in the mirror before her disclosed Mr.Smith's face just
over her shoulder, earnest, pleading, and still very white.She dropped
her gaze, and turned half away.She tried to speak, but only a half-choking little
breath came."Miss Maggie, please don't say no--yet.Let me--explain--about how I
came here, and all that.But first, before I do that, let me tell you
how--how I love you--how I have loved you all these long months.I
THINK I loved you from the first time I saw you.Whatever comes, I want
you to know that.And if you could care for me a little--just a little,
I'm sure I could make it more--in time, so you would marry me.Don't you believe I'd try to make you happy--dear?""Yes, oh, yes," murmured Miss Maggie, still with her head turned away.Then all you've got to say is that you'll let me try.Why, until I came here to this little house, I
didn't know what living, real living, was.And I HAVE been, just as
you said, a selfish old thing."Miss Maggie, with a start of surprise, faced the image in the mirror;
but Mr.Smith was looking at her, not at her reflection, so she did not
meet his ayes."Why, I never--" she stammered."Yes, you did, a minute ago.Oh, of course you
didn't realize--everything, and perhaps you wouldn't have said it if
you'd known.But you said it--and you meant it, and I'm glad you said
it.And, dear little woman, don't you see?That's only another reason
why you should say yes.You can show me how not to be selfish."Smith, I--I-" stammered Miss Maggie, still with puzzled eyes.You can show me how to make life really worth while, for
me, and for--for lots of others And NOW I have some one to care for.And, oh, little woman, I--I care so much, it can't be that you--you
don't care--any!"Miss Maggie caught her breath and turned away again.The red crept up Miss Maggie's neck to her forehead but still she was
silent."If I could only see your eyes," pleaded the man.Then, suddenly, he
saw Miss Maggie's face in the mirror.The next moment Miss Maggie
herself turned a little, and in the mirror their eyes met--and in the
mirror Mr."You DO care--a LITTLE!"he
breathed, as he took her in his arms.Miss Maggie shook her head vigorously against his
coat-collar."I care--a GREAT DEAL," whispered Miss Maggie to the coat-collar, with
shameless emphasis.triumphed the man, bestowing a rapturous kiss on the
tip of a small pink ear--the nearest point to Miss Maggie's lips that
was available, until, with tender determination, he turned her face to
his.A moment later, blushing rosily, Miss Maggie drew herself away."There, we've been quite silly enough--old folks like us."Love is never silly--not real love like ours.Besides,
we're only as old as we feel.I've
lost--YEARS since this morning.And you know I'm just beginning to
live--really live, anyway!"I'm afraid you act it," said Miss Maggie, with mock severity."YOU would--if you'd been through what _I_ have," retorted Mr."And when I think what a botch I made of it, to
begin with--You see, I didn't mean to start off with that, first thing;
and I was so afraid that--that even if you did care for John Smith, you
wouldn't for me--just at first.At arms' length he
held her off, his hands on her shoulders.His happy eyes searching her
face saw the dawn of the dazed, question."Wouldn't care for YOU if I did for John Smith!she demanded, her eyes slowly sweeping him
from head to foot and back again.Instinctively his tongue went back to the old manner of
address, but his hands still held her shoulders."You don't mean--you
can't mean that--that you didn't understand--that you DON'T understand
that I am--Oh, good Heavens!Well, I have made a mess of it this time,"
he groaned.Releasing his hold on her shoulders, he turned and began to
tramp up and down the room."Nice little John-Alden-Miles-Standish
affair this is now, upon my word!Miss Maggie, have I got to--to
propose to you all over again for--for another man, now?"I--I don't think I understand you.""Then you don't know--you didn't understand a few minutes ago, when
I--I spoke first, when I asked you about--about those twenty millions--"

She lifted her hand quickly, pleadingly.Smith, please, don't let's bring money into it at all.I don't
care--I don't care a bit if you haven't got any money.""If I HAVEN'T got any money!"Oh, yes, I know, I said I loved money."The rich red came back to
her face in a flood."But I didn't mean--And it's just as much of a
test and an opportunity when you DON'T have money--more so, if
anything.I never thought of--of how you
might take it--as if I WANTED it.Oh, can't
you--understand?""And I
thought I'd given myself away!He came to her and stood
close, but he did not offer to touch her."I thought, after I'd said
what I did about--about those twenty millions that you understood--that
you knew I was--Stanley Fulton himself."Miss Maggie stood motionless, her eyes looking
straight into his, amazed incredulous.Maggie, don't look at me
like that.She was backing away now, slowly, step by step.Anger, almost loathing,
had taken the place of the amazement and incredulity in her eyes.But--" "And you've been here all these months--yes,
years--under a false name, pretending to be what you weren't--talking
to us, eating at our tables, winning our confidence, letting us talk to
you about yourself, even pretending that--Oh, how could you?""Maggie, dearest," he begged, springing toward her, "if you'll only let
me--"

But she stopped him peremptorily, drawing herself to her full height."I am NOT your dearest," she flamed angrily."I did not give my
love--to YOU."I gave it to John Smith--gentleman, I supposed.A man--poor, yes,
I believed him poor; but a man who at least had a right to his NAME!Stanley G. Fulton, spy, trickster, who makes life
itself a masquerade for SPORT!Stanley G. Fulton,
and--I do not wish to."The words ended in a sound very like a sob; but
Miss Maggie, with her head still high, turned her back and walked to
the window.The man, apparently stunned for a moment, stood watching her, his eyes
grieved, dismayed, hopeless.Then, white-faced, he turned and walked
toward the door.With his hand almost on the knob he slowly wheeled
about and faced the woman again.He hesitated visibly, then in a dull,
lifeless voice he began to speak."Miss Maggie, before John Smith steps entirely out of your life, he
would like to say just this, please, not on justification, but on
explanation of----of Stanley G. Fulton.Fulton did not intend to be a
spy, or a trickster, or to make life a masquerade for--sport.He was a
lonely old man--he felt old.True, he had no
one to care for, but--he had no one to care for HIM, either.He did have a great deal of money--more than he knew what
to do with.Oh, he tried--various ways of spending it.They resulted, chiefly,
in showing him that he wasn't--as wise as he might be in that line,
perhaps."At the window Miss Maggie still stood,
with her back turned as before."The time came, finally," resumed the man, "when Fulton began to wonder
what would become of his millions when he was done with them.He had a
feeling that he would like to will a good share of them to some of his
own kin; but he had no nearer relatives than some cousins back East,
in--Hillerton."Miss Maggie at the window drew in her breath, and held it suspended,
letting it out slowly."He didn't know anything about these cousins," went on the man dully,
wearily, "and he got to wondering what they would do with the money.I
think he felt, as you said to-day that you feel, that one must know how
to spend five dollars if one would get the best out of five thousand.So Fulton felt that, before he gave a man fifteen or twenty millions,
he would like to know--what he would probably do with them.He had seen
so many cases where sudden great wealth had brought--great sorrow."And so then he fixed up a little scheme; he would give each one of
these three cousins of his a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and then,
unknown to them, he would get acquainted with them, and see which of
them would be likely to make the best use of those twenty millions.It
was a silly scheme, of course,--a silly, absurd foolishness from
beginning to end.It--"

He did not finish his sentence.There was a rush of swift feet, a swish
of skirts, then full upon him there fell a whirlwind of sobs, clinging
arms, and incoherent ejaculations."It wasn't silly--it wasn't silly.Oh, I think it was--WONDERFUL!And
I--I'm so ASHAMED!"Later--very much later, when something like lucid coherence had become
an attribute of their conversation, as they sat together upon the old
sofa, the man drew a long breath and said:--

"Then I'm quite forgiven?""And you consider yourself engaged to BOTH John Smith and Stanley G."It sounds pretty bad, but--yes," blushed Miss Maggie."And you must love Stanley G. Fulton just exactly as well--no, a little
better, than you did John Smith.""I'll--try to--if he's as lovable."Miss Maggie's head was at a saucy
tilt."He'll try to be; but--it won't be all play, you know, for you.You've
got to tell him what to do with those twenty millions.By the way, what
WILL you do with them?"Fulton, you HAVE got--And
I forgot all about--those twenty millions."They belong to
Fulton, if you please.Furthermore, CAN'T you call me anything but that
abominable 'Mr.You might--er--abbreviate
it to--er--' Stan,' now.""Perhaps so--but I shan't," laughed Miss Maggie,--"not yet.You may be
thankful I have wits enough left to call you anything--after becoming
engaged to two men all at once.""And with having the responsibility of spending twenty millions, too.""Oh, we can do so much with that money!Why, only think what is
needed right HERE--better milk for the babies, and a community house,
and the streets cleaner, and a new carpet for the church, and a new
hospital with--"

"But, see here, aren't you going to spend some of that money on
yourself?"I'm going to Egypt, and China, and
Japan--with you, of course; and books--oh, you never saw such a lot of
books as I shall buy.And--oh, I'll spend heaps on just my selfish
self--you see if I don't!But, first,--oh, there are so many things
that I've so wanted to do, and it's just come over me this minute that
NOW I can do them!And you KNOW how Hillerton needs a new hospital.""And I want to build a store
and run it so the girls can LIVE, and a factory, too, and decent homes
for the workmen, and a big market, where they can get their food at
cost; and there's the playground for the children, and--"

But Mr.Smith was laughing, and lifting both hands in mock despair."Look here," he challenged, "I THOUGHT you were marrying ME, but--ARE
you marrying me or that confounded money?""Yes, I know; but you see--" She stopped short.Suddenly she laughed again, and threw into his eyes a look so merry, so
whimsical, so altogether challenging, that he demanded:--

"Well, what is it now?""Oh, it's so good, I have--half a mind to tell you."Miss Maggie had left the sofa, and was standing, as if half-poised for
flight, midway to the door."I think--yes, I will tell you," she nodded, her cheeks very pink; "but
I wanted to be--over here to tell it."Do you remember those letters I got awhile ago,
and the call from the Boston; lawyer, that I--I wouldn't tell you
about?""Well; you know you--you thought they--they had something to do
with--my money; that I--I'd lost some.""Well, they--they did have something to do--with money.""Oh, why wouldn't you tell me
then--and let me help you some way?"She shook her head nervously and backed nearer the door.If you don't--I won't tell you.""Well, as I said, it did have something to do--with my money; but just
now, when you asked me if I--I was marrying you or your money--"

"But I was in fun--you know I was in fun!""Oh, yes, I knew that," nodded Miss Maggie."But it--it made me laugh
and remember--the letters.You see, they weren't as you thought.They
didn't tell me of--of money lost.That father's Cousin George in Alaska had died and left me--fifty
thousand dollars.""But, my dear woman, why in Heaven's name wouldn't you tell me that?""You see, I thought
you were poor--very poor, and I--I wouldn't even own up to it myself,
but I knew, in my heart, that I was afraid, if you heard I had this
money, you wouldn't--you wouldn't--ask me to--to--"

She was blushing so adorably now that the man understood and leaped to
his feet."Maggie, you--darling!"But the door had shut--Miss Maggie had fled.CHAPTER XXIV

THAT MISERABLE MONEY


In the evening, after the Martin girls had gone to their rooms, Miss
Maggie and Mr."Of course," he began with a sigh, "I'm really not out of the woods at
all.Blissfully happy as I am, I'm really deeper in the woods than
ever, for now I've got you there with me, to look out for.However
successfully John Smith might dematerialize into nothingness--Maggie
Duff can't.""No, I know she can't," admitted Miss Maggie soberly."Yet if she marries John Smith she'll have to--and if she doesn't marry
him, how's Stanley G. Fulton going to do his courting?Smith, you'll HAVE to tell them--who you are.You'll have to tell them
right away."The man made a playfully wry face."I shall be glad," he observed, "when I shan't have to be held off at
the end of a 'Mr.'!However, we'll let that pass--until we settle the
other matter.Have you given any thought as to HOW I'm going to tell
Cousin Frank and Cousin James and Cousin Flora that I am Stanley G."No--except that you must do it," she answered decidedly."I don't
think you ought to deceive them another minute--not another minute.""And had you thought--as to
what would happen when I did tell them?""Why, n-no, not particularly, except that--that they naturally wouldn't
like it, at first, and that you'd have to explain--just as you did to
me--why you did it.""And do you think they'll like it any better--when I do explain?Miss Maggie meditated; then, a little tremulously she drew in her
breath."Why, you'd have to tell them that--that you did it for a test,
wouldn't you?""And they'd know--they couldn't help knowing--that they had failed to
meet it adequately."And would that help matters any--make things any happier, all
around?""No--oh, no," she frowned despairingly."Would it do anybody any REAL good, now?"N-no," she admitted reluctantly, "except that--that you'd be doing
right."And another thing--aside from the
mortification, dismay, and anger of my good cousins, have you thought
what I'd be bringing on you?"In less than half a dozen hours after the Blaisdells knew that
Mr.John Smith was Stanley G. Fulton, Hillerton would know it.And in
less than half a dozen more hours, Boston, New York, Chicago,--to say
nothing of a dozen lesser cities,--would know it--if there didn't
happen to be anything bigger on foot.Headlines an inch high would
proclaim the discovery of the missing Stanley G. Fulton, and the fine
print below would tell everything that happened, and a great deal that
didn't happen, in the carrying-out of the eccentric multi-millionaire's
extraordinary scheme of testing his relatives with a hundred thousand
dollars apiece to find a suitable heir.Your picture would adorn the
front page of the yellowest of yellow journals, and--"

"MY picture!"Oh, yes, yes," smiled the man imperturbably.Aren't you the affianced bride of Mr.I can see them
now: 'In Search of an Heir and Finds a Wife.'--'Charming Miss Maggie
Duff Falls in Love with Plain John Smith,' and--"

"Oh, no, no," moaned Miss Maggie, shrinking back as if already the
lurid headlines were staring her in the face."Oh, well, it might not be so bad as that, of course.Undoubtedly there are elements for a pretty good story in the
case, and some man, with nothing more important to write up, is bound
to make the most of it somewhere.There's
sure to be unpleasant publicity, my dear, if the truth once leaks out.""But what--what HAD you planned to do?""Well, I HAD planned something like this: pretty quick, now, Mr.Smith
was to announce the completion of his Blaisdell data, and, with
properly grateful farewells, take his departure from Hillerton.There he would go inland on some sort of a
simple expedition with a few native guides and carriers, but no other
companion.Somewhere in the wilderness he would shed his beard and his
name, and would emerge in his proper person of Stanley G. Fulton and
promptly take passage for the States.Of course, upon the arrival in
Chicago of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, there would be a slight flurry at his
appearance, and a few references to the hundred-thousand-dollar gifts
to the Eastern relatives, and sundry speculations as to the why and how
of the exploring trip.There would be various rumors and alleged
interviews; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton never was noted for his
communicativeness, and, after a very short time, the whole thing would
be dismissed as probably another of the gentleman's well-known
eccentricities."Oh, I see," murmured Miss Maggie, in very evident relief."That would
be better--in some ways; only it does seem terrible not to--to tell
them who you are.""But we have just proved that to do that wouldn't bring happiness
anywhere, and would bring misery everywhere, haven't we?""Then why do it?--particularly as by not doing it I am not defrauding
anybody in the least.No; that part isn't worrying me a bit now--but
there is one point that does worry me very much."My scheme gets Stanley G. Fulton back to life and Chicago
very nicely; but it doesn't get Maggie Duff there worth a cent!Maggie
Duff can't marry Mr.John Smith in Hillerton and arrive in Chicago as
the wife of Stanley G. Fulton, can she?""N-no, but he--he can come back and get her--if he wants her."(Miss Maggie blushed all the more at the
method and the fervor of Mr.Smith, smiling at Miss
Maggie's hurried efforts to smooth her ruffled hair.He'd look altogether too much like--like Mr."But your beard will be gone--I wonder how I shall like you without a
beard."Smith laughed and threw up his hands with a doleful shrug."That's what comes of courting as one man and marrying as another," he
groaned.Then, sternly: "I'll warn you right now, Maggie Duff, that
Stanley G. Fulton is going to be awfully jealous of John Smith if you
don't look out.""He should have thought of that before," retorted Miss Maggie, her eyes
mischievous."But, tell me, wouldn't you EVER dare to come--in your
proper person?""Never!--or, at least, not for some time.The beard would be gone, to
be sure; but there'd be all the rest to tattle--eyes, voice, size,
manner, walk--everything; and smoked glasses couldn't cover all that,
you know.They'd only result
in making me look more like John Smith than ever.John Smith, you
remember, wore smoked glasses for some time to hide Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton from the ubiquitous reporter.Stanley G. Fulton can't
come to Hillerton.So, as Mahomet can't go to the mountain, the
mountain must come to Mahomet."Miss Maggie's eyes were growing dangerously mutinous."That you will have to come to Chicago--yes.""I love you with your head tilted that way."(Miss Maggie promptly
tilted it the other.)"Or that, either, for that matter," continued Mr."However, speaking of courting--Mr.Fulton will do
that, all right, and endeavor to leave nothing lacking, either as to
quantity or quality.Haven't you got some friend that you can visit?"Miss Maggie's answer was prompt and emphatic--too prompt and too
emphatic for unquestioning acceptance."Oh, yes, you have," asserted the man cheerfully."I don't know her
name--but she's there.She's Waving a red flag from your face this
minute!Well, turn your head away, if you like--if you can
listen better that way," he went on tranquilly paying no attention to
her little gasp."Well, all you have to do is to write the lady you're
coming, and go.Stanley G. Fulton will find
a way to meet her.Then he'll call and meet
you--and be so pleased to see you!There'll be a
regular whirlwind courtship then--calls, dinners, theaters, candy,
books, flowers!You'll be immensely surprised, of course, but you'll accept.Then we'll
get married," he finished with a deep sigh of satisfaction."Say, CAN'T you call me anything--" he began wrathfully, but
interrupted himself."However, it's better that you don't, after all.But you wait
till you meet Mr.Now, what's her name,
and where does she live?"Miss Maggie laughed in spite of herself, as she said severely: "Her
name, indeed!Stanley G. Fulton is so in the habit of
having his own way that he forgets he is still Mr.However,
there IS an old schoolmate," she acknowledged demurely.Now, write her at once, and tell her you're
coming.""But she--she may not be there."I think you'd
better plan to go pretty soon after I go to South America.Stanley G. Fulton arrives in Chicago and can write
the news back here to Hillerton.Oh, they'll get it in the papers, in
time, of course; but I think it had better come from you first.You
see--the reappearance on this earth of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton is going
to be of--of some moment to them, you know.Hattie, for
instance, who is counting on the rest of the money next November.""Yes, I know, it will mean a good deal to them, of course.Still, I
don't believe Hattie is really expecting the money.At any rate, she
hasn't said anything about it very lately--perhaps because she's been
too busy bemoaning the pass the present money has brought them to.""No, no--I didn't mean to bring that up," apologized Miss Maggie
quickly, with an apprehensive glance into his face."And it wasn't
miserable money a bit!Besides, Hattie has--has learned her lesson, I'm
sure, and she'll do altogether differently in the new home.Smith, am I never to--to come back here?"Indeed we can--some time, by and by, when all this has blown over, and
they've forgotten how Mr.Meanwhile, you can come alone--a VERY little.I shan't let you leave me
very much.But I understand; you'll have to come to see your friends.Besides, there are all those playgrounds for the babies and cleaner
milk for the streets, and--"

"Cleaner milk for the streets, indeed!"Oh, yes, it WAS the milk for the babies, wasn't it?""Well, however that may be you'll have to come back to
superintend all those things you've been wanting to do so long.But"--his face grew a little wistful--"you don't want to spend too much
time here.You know--Chicago has a few babies that need cleaner milk."Her face grew softly luminous as it had grown
earlier in the afternoon."So you can bestow some of your charity there; and--"

"It isn't charity," she interrupted with suddenly flashing eyes."Oh,
how I hate that word--the way it's used, I mean.Of course, the real
charity means love.I suppose it was LOVE that made John
Daly give one hundred dollars to the Pension Fund Fair--after he'd
jewed it out of those poor girls behind his counters!Morse
went around everywhere telling how kind dear Mr.Daly was to give so
much to charity!Nobody wants charity--except a few lazy
rascals like those beggars of Flora's!And
if half the world gave the other half its rights there wouldn't BE any
charity, I believe."Smith
held up both hands in mock terror."I shall be petitioning her for my
bread and butter, yet!"Smith, when I think of all that
money"--her eyes began to shine again--"and of what we can do with it,
I--I just can't believe it's so!""But you aren't expecting that twenty millions are going to right all
the wrongs in the world, are you?""No, oh, no; but we can help SOME that we know about.But it isn't that
I just want to GIVE, you know.We must get behind things--to the
causes.We must--"

"We must make the Mr.Dalys pay more to their girls before they pay
anything to pension funds, eh?"Smith, as Miss Maggie came
to a breathless pause."Oh, can't you SEE what we can
do--with that twenty million dollars?"Smith, his gaze on Miss Maggie's flushed cheeks and shining eyes,
smiled tenderly."I see--that I'm being married for my money--after all!"sniffed Miss Maggie, so altogether bewitchingly that Mr.Smith
gave her a rapturous kiss.JOHN SMITH


Early in July Mr.He made a
farewell call upon each of the Blaisdell families, and thanked them
heartily for all their kindness in assisting him with his Blaisdell
book.The Blaisdells, one and all, said they were very sorry to have him go.Miss Flora frankly wiped her eyes, and told Mr.Smith she could never,
never thank him enough for what he had done for her.Mellicent, too,
with shy eyes averted, told him she should never forget what he had
done for her--and for Donald.James and Flora and Frank--and even Jane!--said that they would like to
have one of the Blaisdell books, when they were published, to hand down
in the family.Flora took out her purse and said that she would pay for
hers now; but Mr.Smith hastily, and with some evident embarrassment,
refused the money, saying that he could not tell yet what the price of
the book would be.All the Blaisdells, except Frank, Fred, and Bessie, went to the station
to see Mr.They told him he was
just like one of the family, anyway, and they declared they hoped he
would come back soon.Frank telephoned him that he would have gone,
too, if he had not had so much to do at the store.Smith seemed pleased at all this attention--he seemed, indeed,
quite touched; but he seemed also embarrassed--in fact, he seemed often
embarrassed during those last few days at Hillerton.Miss Maggie Duff did not go to the station to see Mr.Miss
Flora, on her way home, stopped at the Duff cottage and reproached Miss
Maggie for the delinquency."All the rest of us did,
'most."You're Blaisdells--but I'm not, you know.""You're just as good as one, Maggie Duff!Besides, hasn't that man
boarded here for over a year, and paid you good money, too?""Why, y-yes, of course.""Well, then, I don't think it would have hurt you any to show him this
last little attention.He'll think you don't like him, or--or are mad
about something, when all the rest of us went.""Well, then, if--Why, Maggie Duff, you're BLUSHING!"she broke off,
peering into Miss Maggie's face in a way that did not tend to lessen
the unmistakable color that was creeping to her forehead.I declare, if you were twenty years younger, and I didn't
know better, I should say that--" She stopped abruptly, then plunged
on, her countenance suddenly alight with a new idea."NOW I know why
you didn't go to the station, Maggie Duff!That man proposed to you,
and you refused him!"gasped Miss Maggie, her face scarlet.Hattie always said it would be a match--from
the very first, when he came here to your house."gasped Miss Maggie again, looking about her very much as if
she were meditating flight."Well, she did--but I didn't believe it.You refused
him--now, didn't you?"Miss Maggie caught her breath a little convulsively."Well, I suppose you didn't,
then, if you say so.And I don't need to ask if you accepted him.You
didn't, of course, or you'd have been there to see him off.And he
wouldn't have gone then, anyway, probably.So he didn't ask you, I
suppose.Well, I never did believe, like Hattie did, that--"

"Flora," interrupted Miss Maggie desperately, "WILL you stop talking in
that absurd way?Listen, I did not care to go to the station to-day.I'm going to see my old classmate, Nellie
Maynard--Mrs.It's lovely, of course, only--only I--I'm so
surprised!"All the more reason why I should, then.It's time I did," smiled Miss
Maggie.And I do hope you can DO it, and
that it won't peter out at the last minute, same's most of your good
times do.And you've had such a hard life--and your
boarder leaving, too!That'll make a lot of difference in your
pocketbook, won't it?But, Maggie, you'll have to have some new
clothes."I've got to have--oh,
lots of things."And, Maggie,"--Miss Flora's face grew
eager,--"please, PLEASE, won't you let me help you a little--about
those clothes?And get some nice ones--some real nice ones, for once.Please, Maggie, there's a good girl!""Thank you, no, dear," refused Miss Maggie, shaking her head with a
smile."But I appreciate your kindness just the same--indeed, I do!""If you wouldn't be so horrid proud," pouted Miss Flora.I was going to tell
you soon, anyway, and I'll tell it now.I HAVE money, dear,--lots of it
now."Father's Cousin George died two months ago.""Yes; and to father's daughter he left--fifty thousand dollars."But he loved father, you know, years ago,
and father loved him.""But had you ever heard from him--late years?"Father was very angry because he went to Alaska in the first
place, you know, and they haven't ever written very often."They sent me a thousand--just for pin money, they
said.The lawyer's written several times, and he's been here once.I
believe it's all to come next month.""Oh, I'm so glad, Maggie," breathed Flora.I don't know
of anybody I'd rather see take a little comfort in life than you!"At the door, fifteen minutes later, Miss Flora said again how glad she
was; but she added wistfully:--

"I'm sure I don't know, though, what I'm going to do all summer without
you.Just think how lonesome we'll be--you gone to Chicago, Hattie and
Jim and all their family moved to Plainville, and even Mr.And I think we're going to miss Mr."Indeed, I do think he was a very nice man!""Now, Flora, I shall want you to go shopping with me lots.And Miss Flora, eagerly entering into Miss Maggie's discussion of
frills and flounces, failed to notice that Miss Maggie had dropped the
subject of Mr.Hillerton had much to talk about during those summer days.Smith's
going had created a mild discussion--the "ancestor feller" was well
known and well liked in the town.But even his departure did not arouse
the interest that was bestowed upon the removal of the James Blaisdells
to Plainville; and this, in turn, did not cause so great an excitement
as did the news that Miss Maggie Duff had inherited fifty thousand
dollars and had gone to Chicago to spend it.And the fact that nearly
all who heard this promptly declared that they hoped she WOULD spend a
good share of it--in Chicago, or elsewhere--on herself, showed pretty
well just where Miss Maggie Duff stood in the hearts of Hillerton.It was early in September that Miss Flora had the letter from Miss
Maggie.Not but that she had received letters from Miss Maggie before,
but that the contents of this one made it at once, to all the
Blaisdells, "the letter."Miss Flora began to read it, gave a little cry, and sprang to her feet.Standing, her breath suspended, she finished it.Five minutes later,
gloves half on and hat askew, she was hurrying across the common to her
brother Frank's home."Jane, Jane," she panted, as soon as she found her sister-in-law."I've
had a letter from Maggie.She's just been living on having that money.And us, with all we've
lost, too!But, then, maybe we wouldn't have got it, anyway.And I never thought to bring it," ejaculated Miss Flora
vexedly.She said it would be in all the Eastern papers right away,
of course, but she wanted to tell us first, so we wouldn't be so
surprised.Walked into his lawyer's office without a
telegram, or anything.Tyndall
brought home the news that night in an 'Extra'; but that's all it
told--just that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the multi-millionaire who
disappeared nearly two years ago on an exploring trip to South America,
had come back alive and well.Then it told all about the two letters he
left, and the money he left to us, and all that, Maggie said; and it
talked a lot about how lucky it was that he got back just in time
before the other letter had to be opened next November.But it didn't
say any more about his trip, or anything.The morning papers will have
more, Maggie said, probably.""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane, rolling the corner of her
upper apron nervously.(Since the forty-thousand-dollar loss Jane had
gone back to her old habit of wearing two aprons.)"Where DO you
suppose he's been all this time?"Maggie said it wasn't known--that the paper didn't say.It was an
'Extra' anyway, and it just got in the bare news of his return.Besides, Maggie'll
write again about it, I'm sure.I'm so glad she's having
such a good time!""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane again nervously."Say, Flora,
I wonder--do you suppose WE'LL ever hear from him?He left us all that
money--he knows that, of course.He can't ask for it back--the lawyer
said he couldn't do that!But, I wonder--do you
suppose we ought to write him and--and thank him?"exclaimed Miss Flora, aghast.I'd be
scared to death to do such a thing as that.Oh, you don't think we've
got to do THAT?"We'd want to do what was right and proper, of course.But I don't see--" She paused helplessly.Miss Flora gave a sudden hysterical little laugh."Well, I don't see how we're going to find out what's proper, in this
case," she giggled."We can't write to a magazine, same as I did when I
wanted to know how to answer invitations and fix my knives and forks on
the table.We CAN'T write to them, 'cause nothing like this ever
happened before, and they wouldn't know what to say.How'd we look
writing, 'Please, dear Editor, when a man wills you a hundred thousand
dollars and then comes to life again, is it proper or not proper to
write and thank him?'They'd think we was crazy, and they'd have reason
to!For my part, I--"

The telephone bell rang sharply, and Jane rose to answer it.When she came back she was even more excited.she questioned, as Miss
Flora got hastily to her feet.I left everything just as it was and ran, when I got the
letter.I'll get a paper myself on the way home.I'm going to call up
Hattie, too, on the long distance.My, it's'most as exciting as it was
when it first came,--the money, I mean,--isn't it?"panted Miss Flora
as she hurried away.The Blaisdells bought many papers during the next few days.But even by
the time that the Stanley G. Fulton sensation had dwindled to a short
paragraph in an obscure corner of a middle page, they (and the public
in general) were really little the wiser, except for these bare facts:--

Stanley G. Fulton had arrived at a South American hotel, from the
interior, had registered as S. Fulton, frankly to avoid publicity, and
had taken immediate passage to New York.Arriving at New York, still to
avoid publicity, he had not telegraphed his attorneys, but had taken
the sleeper for Chicago, and had fortunately not met any one who
recognized him until his arrival in that city.He had brought home
several fine specimens of Incan textiles and potteries: and he declared
that he had had a very enjoyable and profitable trip.He did not care to talk of his experiences, he said.For a time, of course, his return was made much of.Fake interviews and
rumors of threatened death and disaster in impenetrable jungles made
frequent appearance; but in an incredibly short time the flame of
interest died from want of fuel to feed upon; and, as Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton himself had once predicted, the matter was soon dismissed as
merely another of the multi-millionaire's well-known eccentricities.All of this the Blaisdells heard from Miss Maggie in addition to seeing
it in the newspapers.But very soon, from Miss Maggie, they began to
learn more.Before a fortnight had passed, Miss Flora received another
letter from Chicago that sent her flying as before to her sister-in-law."Jane, Jane, Maggie's MET HIM!"she cried, breathlessly bursting into
the kitchen where Jane was paring the apples that she would not trust
to the maid's more wasteful knife.With a hasty twirl of a now reckless knife, Jane finished the
last apple, set the pan on the table before the maid, and hurried her
visitor into the living-room."Now, tell me quick--what did she say?"Yes--yes--everything," nodded Miss Flora, sinking into a chair."She
liked him real well, she said and he knows all about that she belongs
to us.Oh, I hope she didn't
tell him about--Fred!""And that awful gold-mine stock," moaned Jane."But she wouldn't--I
know she wouldn't!""Of course she wouldn't," cried Miss Flora."'Tisn't like Maggie one
bit!She'd only tell the nice things, I'm sure.And, of course, she'd
tell him how pleased we were with the money!"And to think she's met him--really met
him!"She turned an excited face to her
daughter, who had just entered the room.Aunt
Flora's just had a letter from Aunt Maggie, and she's met Mr.Fulton--actually TALKED with him!"Yes, he's real nice, your Aunt
Maggie says, and she likes him very much."Tyndall brought him home
one night and introduced him to his wife and Maggie; and since then
he's been very nice to them.He's taken them out in his automobile, and
taken them to the theater twice.""That's because she belongs to us, of course," nodded Jane wisely."Yes, I suppose so," agreed Flora."And I think it's very kind of him.""_I_ think he does it because he
WANTS to.I'll warrant she's
nicer and sweeter and--and, yes, PRETTIER than lots of those old
Chicago women.Aunt Maggie looked positively HANDSOME that day she left
here last July.Probably he LIKES
to take her to places.Anyhow, I'm glad she's having one good time
before she dies.""Yes, so am I, my dear."I only wish he'd marry her and--and give her a good time all her
life," avowed Mellicent, lifting her chin.She's good enough for him," bridled Mellicent."Aunt
Maggie's good enough for anybody!""Maggie's a saint--if
ever there was one.""Yes, but I shouldn't call her a MARRYING saint," smiled Jane."Well, I don't know about that," frowned Miss Flora thoughtfully."Hattie always declared there'd be a match between her and Mr."Well, then, I
shall stick to my original statement that Maggie Duff is a saint, all
right, but not a marrying one--unless some one marries her now for her
money, of course.""As if Aunt Maggie'd stand for that!""Besides, she
wouldn't have to!Aunt Maggie's good enough to be married for herself.""There, there, child, just because you are a love-sick little piece of
romance just now, you needn't think everybody else is," her mother
reproved her a little sharply.But Mellicent only laughed merrily as she disappeared into her own room.Smith, I wonder where he is, and if he'll ever come
back here," mused Miss Flora, aloud.He was a very
nice man, and I liked him.""Goodness, Flora, YOU aren't, getting romantic, too, are you?"teased
her sister-in-law.ejaculated Miss Flora sharply, buttoning up her coat."I'm no more romantic than--than poor Maggie herself is!"Two weeks later, to a day, came Miss Maggie's letter announcing her
engagement to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, and saying that she was to be
married in Chicago before Christmas.CHAPTER XXVI

REENTER MR.STANLEY G. FULTON


In the library of Mrs.Stanley G.
Fulton was impatiently awaiting the appearance of Miss Maggie Duff.In
a minute she came in, looking charmingly youthful in her new,
well-fitting frock.The man, quickly on his feet at her entrance, gave her a lover's ardent
kiss; but almost instantly he held her off at arms' length."Why, dearest, what's the matter?""You look as if--if something had happened--not exactly a bad
something, but--What is it?""That's one of the very nicest things about you, Mr.Stanley-G.-Fulton-John-Smith," she sighed, nestling comfortably into
the curve of his arm, as they sat down on the divan;--"that you NOTICE
things so.And it seems so good to me to have somebody--NOTICE."And to think of all these years I've wasted!""Oh, but I shan't be lonely any more now.And, listen--I'll tell you
what made me look so funny.You know I
wrote them--about my coming marriage.""I believe--I'll let you read the letter for yourself, Stanley.It
tells some things, toward the end that I think you'll like to know,"
she said, a little hesitatingly, as she held out the letter she had
brought into the room with her.I'd like to read it," cried Fulton, whisking the closely written
sheets from the envelope.MY DEAR MAGGIE (Flora had written): Well, mercy me, you have given us a
surprise this time, and no mistake!Yet we're all real glad, Maggie,
and we hope you'll be awfully happy.You've had such an awfully hard time all your life!Well, when your letter came, we were just going out to Jim's for an
old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner, so I took it along with me and read
it to them all.I kept it till we were all together, too, though I most
bursted with the news all the way out.Well, you ought to have heard their tongues wag!They were all struck
dumb first, for a minute, all except Mellicent.She spoke up the very
first thing, and clapped her hands.I knew Aunt Maggie was good
enough for anybody!"To explain that I'll have to go back a little.We were talking one day
about you--Jane and Mellicent and me--and we said you were a saint,
only not a marrying saint.But Mellicent thought you were, and it seems
she was right.Oh, of course, we'd all thought once Mr.Smith might
take a fancy to you, but we never dreamed of such a thing as this--Mr.Sakes alive--I can hardly sense it yet!Jane, for a minute, forgot how rich he was, and spoke right up real
quick--"It's for her money, of course.I KNEW some one would marry her
for that fifty thousand dollars!"But she laughed then, right off, with
the rest of us, at the idea of a man worth twenty millions marrying
ANYBODY for fifty thousand dollars.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END

THE SELECTION OF SIRES


The question of mating is one of great importance in the breeding of
any class of live stock, hence the necessity of rejecting a commonplace
sire whether he is to be purchased or only patronized for nominations.The cheap sire is common enough even in these days, and the fact that
his services cost little gives him a popularity altogether unmerited
and very injurious to the best interests of Shire breeding.Quite
recently I saw twenty quarters of wheat delivered by a small farmer
from whom it was purchased.In one of the carts I was surprised to find
a five-year-old stallion, light in bone, pale chestnut in colour, and
quite small--just the sort to haul guns or baggage to “the front” at
the present time, but obviously unfit to serve a mare if a weighty cart
horse was expected as the result.Yet the owner claimed to have got
a lot of mares to this horse for the past two seasons.This sort of
thing going on all over the country, naturally lowers the standard.A
farmer saves a yearling colt because he “likes the look of it.” At two
years old he uses him on his own mares and invites his neighbours to
send theirs, the terms being something like £1 each mare, or, perhaps,
“No colt, no pay,” and £1 10_s._ if the mare proves to be in foal.Such a system of breeding may help to increase the horse population,
and those bred in this haphazard fashion may find a ready market while
a great war is in progress, but it is not Shire breeding in the true
sense; therefore a farmer who possesses even a useful mare should
not object to paying a reasonable service fee, or, if he uses his
neighbour’s horse, he should at least ascertain if he is sound and of
good parentage.The work of the Shire Horse Society is to “improve the Old English
Breed of Cart Horses.” It has been carried on for thirty-six years
very successfully, notwithstanding the injurious effect wrought by
such stallions as that above mentioned, and it rests with the present
members of the Shire Horse Society to carry on the work which, as
aforesaid, was so well begun and maintained by such men as the late
Sir Walter Gilbey, to whom all lovers of Shire Horses are indebted for
his book on “The Great Horse,” which gives the history of the breed
from the time of the Roman Invasion till the year 1889 (when the first
edition of the book appeared), at which date Shire Horse breeding had
become a great national industry, that year having been the best on
record for the number of export certificates granted.A second edition
brings the work up to 1899.When wealthy stud owners place the best of stallions within the reach
of tenant farmers it is a mistake to miss the opportunity, but those
less fortunately placed are now able, if they desire to do so, to
profit by the Development Grant of the State, which enables them to get
mares to sound--if not front rank--stallions at low fees or by assisted
nominations.That a horse breeder should be content to mate his mares
with a mongrel when it is easily possible to aim higher seems difficult
to understand in these days when pedigree means so much in market
value.For the production of geldings, fashionable blood is not essential,
but it sometimes happens that a foal of outstanding merit is bred
by quite a small farmer, and if such an one is by a well-known sire
of prize-winning stock, a real good price may be obtained, if the
dam is only registered, so there is much to be said in favour of
using the highest type of Shire stallion, even by owners of one or
two mares.Fortunately farmers are able to secure special terms for
their mares from most stud owners, and there are many local societies
which hire a real good horse and charge a smaller sum to their own
members than to outsiders.Among such societies may be mentioned
Peterborough, Welshpool, and Winslow, in all of which districts many
high-class Shires have been bred.Then there are generous landlords
who hire a real good horse for the benefit of their tenants--although
not Shire breeders themselves--so that it is quite possible for the
majority of tenant farmers to obtain nominations to one of the best
of Shire stallions if he is bent on improvement and believes in being
enterprising enough to obtain it.The indifference which leads horse
breeders to use a mongrel which comes into the yard, rather than
send further afield to a better animal is inexcusable in a member of
the Shire Horse Society, neither is such an one likely to improve his
financial position by means of his heavy horses, which large numbers of
farmers have done during the depressed times.An extra five pounds for
a service fee may be, and often is, fifty when the foal is sold.CHAPTER IV

BREEDING FROM FILLIES


For many years it has been a debatable point whether two-year-old
fillies should be bred from or not.The pros and cons have been
discussed, and in the end Shire breeders have used their own discretion
on the point.Superior animals have, however, been bred from youthful
parents on both sides, a notable instance being the late Lord Wantage’s
Lady Victoria; her sire was Prince William, the London and Royal
Champion, and her dam Glow, by the London Champion Spark.She was the
first foal of a two-year-old colt, with a two-year-old filly for her
dam, yet she made a great prize-winning mare, having won first and cup
in London in 1889 and championship of the Oxfordshire Show in 1890.It may also be mentioned that Buscot Harold, the London Champion
stallion of 1898, was begotten when his sire, Markeaton Royal Harold,
was but a two-year-old colt, although his dam, Aurea, was older.At two
years old he was preferred to his sire for the Elsenham Challenge Cup.This proves that Shire breeders have been making good use of fillies
for many years, therefore the produce of a three-year-old filly
need not be rejected, neither should the nursing of a foal at that
age necessarily result in a stunted or plain mare.It is, however,
necessary to grow fillies along with the aid of supplementary food and
to “do” both them and their foals well while they are suckling.There is no doubt that the Shires of the present day do get more food
and attention than they did in bygone days, when it was unnecessary
to strive after showyard size, because shows did not exist in such
numbers, so that the farmer who exhibited cart horses was rarely met
with, and young horse stock were not fed to encourage size and growth.So long as they could be put into the team at three years old and mated
at four, that was considered early enough to work or to breed.At the present time the horse population of Great Britain and Europe,
if not of the whole world, is being reduced by the greatest of all
wars, consequently it is desirable for Shire breeders to do their share
towards making good the shortage.If fillies are well kept from birth
they will attain size and may be mated at two years old to a young
horse, but not too early in the season.The end of May is early enough
for fillies, and a big heavy old horse should not be chosen under
any circumstances.If served at the right time they are more likely
to breed than fillies a year older, and it makes a lot of difference
whether a five-year-old mare has a couple of sons and daughters or even
one to her credit, or no offspring at all, when the profit and loss
account is being made up by a farmer.It may be that a three-year-old cannot be got into a fat state for
show with a foal running by her side, but the prolonged rest at that
age does her no harm.She will come up all right at a later period,
and is more likely to make a regular breeder than if not mated till
three years old.A mare which breeds from the age of three till she
is fifteen is a great help in the way of production, even if she only
averages one foal in two years, which is, perhaps, as many as it is
safe to reckon on for rearing to maturity, although, of course, there
are plenty of mares which have produced a good foal for ten or eleven
years in succession.They will breed till they are twenty-five, to the
writer’s knowledge, but the average age at which Shire mares breed
their last foal must be put somewhere round fifteen.There is no doubt that we have learned much in horse management since
shows have become so popular, although it may be that high feeding for
show purposes has been--and is--the cause of a lower percentage of
foals among high class show animals of both sexes.To prepare fillies for mating at two years old may be compared to
feeding for early maturity in cattle and sheep, except that many of the
latter are only grown and fattened to be killed, whereas Shires are
meant to live a long and useful life.It is, therefore, necessary to
build up a frame with this idea in view.An outdoor life should be led,
while the food should be both good and sufficient, as well as being
suitable.There is no time to be wasted, and if foals are allowed to get into low
condition while being weaned, or during their first winter, they are
less fit to make robust two-year-olds fit either to work or to breed,
or what is more profitable, to accomplish both of these tasks together
during part of the year.If early maturity is aimed at with any class of stock, feeding and
management must be of the best, therefore farmers who half starve their
foals and allow their yearlings to be wintered on a bit of hay must not
expect their two-year-olds to be well grown and in the best possible
condition for parental duties.The situation at the present time is such that every horse-breeder
should do his best to utilize to the full the horse stock which he
possesses, so that a sufficient number of horses may be obtained to
carry on the agriculture and trade of the country, both of which are
likely to require horses in large numbers in the immediate future.Mares will be relatively more scarce than stallions for the reason
that the latter have not been “commandeered” for war purposes, but as
geldings have been taken in large numbers, there is, and will be, a
great demand for workers of all grades.Under such circumstances Shire breeders may serve their own interests
by mating their fillies with a good young sire at two years old and
keeping them in good condition for producing a strong vigorous foal.Very few of Robert Bakewell’s remarks are recorded, but this one is,
“The only way to be sure of good offspring is to have good cows as well
as good bulls,” and this applies with equal, if not greater, force in
the business of horse-breeding; the sire cannot effect the whole of the
improvement.CHAPTER V

TEAM WORK


Since my very youthful days I have always been accustomed to putting
cart colts into the team at two years old, a system which cannot be too
strongly advocated at the present time, when every worker in the shape
of a horse is needed.There are numbers of high-class Shires living a life of luxurious
idleness to-day, for the only reason that they were never trained to
work, yet they would be quite as well in health, and more likely to
breed, if they were helping to do ploughing or almost any kind of
farm work when not actually nursing a foal or being prepared for any
important show.When a Shire mare can be sold as “a good worker,” a buyer feels that he
is getting something for his money, even if she fails to breed, so that
there is much to be said in favour of putting fillies into the team,
and nothing against, so far as I know, unless they are over-worked,
strained, or stunted.A non-breeding mare which will not work is an impossible, or useless,
sort of animal on a farm, where mere ornaments are not required,
whereas if she is a worker in all gears she is “anybody’s mare”; on the
other hand, she is nobody’s if she refuses either to work or to breed.Geldings for haulage purposes are always in demand, but big powerful
mares are equally useful for the same purpose, and it is much better to
sell a non-breeder for the lorry than to sell her for another breeder
to meet with disappointment.It is obvious that there will be a great
scarcity of weighty working horses when the countries now involved in
war settle down to peaceful trades and occupations, and there is no
country which stands to benefit more than Great Britain, which is the
best of all breeding grounds for draught horses.To allow, what would otherwise be, a useful worker to eat the bread
of idleness because it was regarded as too well bred or valuable to
wear a collar is not a policy to pursue or to recommend, especially to
farmers, seeing that the arable land tenant can put a colt into the
team, between two steady horses at almost any time of the year, while
the occupiers of grass farms may easily start their young Shires as
workers by hitching them to a log of wood or some chain harrows, and
afterwards work them in a roll.There is no doubt, whatever, that many stallions would leave a much
higher percentage of foals if they were “broken in” during their
two-year-old days, so that they would take naturally to work when they
grew older and could therefore be relied upon to work and thus keep
down superfluous fat.This would be far better than allowing them to
spend something like nine months of the year in a box or small paddock
with nothing to do but eat.In past times more working stallions could be found, and they
were almost invariably good stock getters, but since showing has
become popular it is almost a general rule to keep well-bred, or
prize-winning, colts quite clear of the collar lest they should work
themselves down in condition and so fail to please possible buyers on
the look-out for show candidates.A little more than twenty years ago there was an outcry against show
condition in Shires, and this is what a very eminent breeder of those
days said on the subject of fat--

    “It is a matter of no consequence to any one, save their
    owners, when second or third-class horses are laden with
    blubber; but it is a national calamity when the best
    animals--those that ought to be the proud sires and dams of
    an ever-improving race--are stuffed with treacle and drugged
    with poisons in order to compete successfully with their
    inferiors.Hence come fever in the feet, diseased livers, fatty
    degeneration of the heart, and a host of ailments that often
    shorten the lives of their victims and always injure their
    constitutions.”

This bears out my contention that Shires of both sexes would pay for a
course of training in actual collar work, no matter how blue-blooded as
regards ancestry or how promising for the show ring.The fact that a
colt by a London champion had been seen in the plough team, or between
a pair of shafts, would not detract from his value in the eyes of a
judge, or prevent him from becoming a weighty and muscular horse; in
fact, it would tend to the development of the arms and thighs which
one expects to find in a Shire stallion, and if from any cause a stud
or show career is closed, a useful one at honest work may still be
carried on.Wealthy stud owners can afford to pay grooms to exercise their horses,
but farmers find--and are more than ever likely to find--that it is
necessary to make the best possible use of their men; therefore,
if their colts and fillies are put to work and rendered perfectly
tractable, they will grow up as stallions which may be worked instead
of being aimlessly exercised, while the mares can spend at least half
of their lives in helping to carry on the ordinary work of the farm.It is certainly worth while to take pains to train a young Shire,
which is worth rearing at all, to lead from its foalhood days so that
it is always approachable if required for show or sale, and these
early lessons prepare it for the time when it is old enough to put its
shoulders into the collar, this being done with far less risk than it
is in the case of youngsters which have been turned away and neglected
till they are three years old.The breaking in of this class of colt
takes time and strength, while the task of getting a halter on is no
light one, and the whole business of lungeing, handling, and harnessing
requires more brute force and courage than the docile animal trained in
infancy calls for.The secret of training any horse is to keep it from knowing its own
strength; therefore, if it is taught to lead before it is strong enough
to break away, and to be tied up before it can break the headcollar
by hanging back it is obvious that less force is required.The horse
which finds he can break his halter by hanging back is likely to become
a troublesome animal to stand tied up, while the one which throws its
rider two or three times does not forget that it is possible to get a
man off its back; therefore it is better and safer if they never gain
such knowledge of their own powers.The Shire breeding farmer ought to be able to go into his field and put
a halter on any animal required, from a foal to an old horse, and he
can do this if they have been treated with kindness and handled from
their early days.This is a matter to which many farmers should give more attention than
they do, seeing that an ill-trained show animal may lose a prize for no
other reason than that its show manners are faulty, whereas those of
the nearest rival are perfect.The writer was taught this while showing at a County Show very early in
his career.The animal he was leading was--like himself--rather badly
educated, and this was noticed by one of the oldest and best judges of
that day, and this is what he whispered in his ear, “My lad, if you
would only spend your time training your horses instead of going to
cricket they would do you more credit and win more prizes.” This advice
I have never forgotten, and I pass it on for the benefit of those who
have yet to learn “the ropes.”




CHAPTER VI

REARING AND FEEDING


During the past few years we have heard much about early maturity with
all kinds of stock.Four-year-old bullocks are rarely seen in these
days, while wether sheep are being superseded by tegs.With Shire
Horses there has been a considerable amount of attention paid to size
in yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which, as before stated, is
equivalent to early maturity in the case of cattle and sheep.For the
purpose of getting size an animal must be well fed from birth, and this
applies to foals.Of course, the date of birth counts for a good deal
when foals are shown with their dams, as it does to a less extent with
yearlings, but after that age it makes very little difference whether a
foal is born in February or in May.From a farmer’s point of view I do not believe in getting Shire foals
too early.They have to be housed for a lengthened period, and the
dams fed on food which may be expensive.At the present time good oats
are worth 30_s._ per quarter, and hay, fit for horses, at least 90_s._
per ton, so that two or three months of winter feeding means a little
sum added to the cost of raising a foal.The middle of April is early enough for the average foal to arrive,
and he can then make quite a good size by September if his dam is an
ordinarily good suckler and he contracts no ailments, such as chills
or scour, to check his progress.When colts are a month old they will
begin to pick up crushed oats and bran while the dam is feeding,
therefore it is no trouble to teach them to eat from a manger.A word of caution is necessary to the inexperienced in the matter of
feeding the dam until the foal is a few days old and strong enough to
take all her milk.This is to feed the mare sparingly so as not to
flush her milk while the youngster is unable to take it fast enough.Of
course, the surplus can be milked away, as it should be if the bag is
tight, but this may be neglected and then scour is often set up, which
a very young foal often succumbs to.It is better that the mare should
have too little than too much milk while the youngster gets fairly on
his legs.Cows always have most of their milk taken away, but young lambs as well
as foals often suffer through taking too much of the dam’s milk during
the first day or two of their existence.If a foal is born during the grazing season the flow of milk can be
regulated by keeping the mare in a bare pasture, or shutting her up for
part of the day.Supposing that the foal survives the ills incidental to its early life,
and gains in strength with the lengthening days, its first dry food
will be taken when the mare is fed, which she should be, especially
if she is either a young or an old mare, while show candidates will
naturally need something more than grass.The object is to promote
steady growth and maintain good health, and it should not be forgotten
that oats are the best of all corn for horses; therefore no other kind
should be given to a foal, but on good grazing land a mare will usually
maintain herself and her foal in good condition for a good part of the
summer without manger food.It is towards weaning time that a manger is needed, into which should
be put crushed (not whole) oats, together with an equal quantity of
bran and a bit of good chaff.At the outset the mare will eat most of
it, but the foal will benefit by getting richer milk and more of it,
which he can now take without any ill effects.In time he acquires the
habit of standing up to the manger and taking his share.It is very
necessary to see that all foals eat well before they are weaned.The cost of feeding a foal during its first winter may be roughly
reckoned at ten shillings per week, which is made up as follows--

                             _s._ _d._

    80 lbs.of oats           6    0
    56    ”    hay            2    0
    28    ”    bran           1    6
    28    ”    oat straw      0    9
    28    ”    carrots        0    3

The bulk of the hay and all the oat straw should be fed in the form of
chaff with the oats, bran and carrots (well cleaned and pulped), then
a very good everyday diet can be formed by mixing the whole together,
and one which few horses will refuse.Of course the items are not
reckoned at the extreme prices prevailing in the winter of 1914-1915,
but they could often be bought for less, so that it is a fair average.It will be seen that oats form the biggest part, for the reason
aforesaid, that they are better than other kinds of corn.A little long hay should be given at night--more when there is snow on
the ground--the other mixture divided into two feeds per day, morning
and evening, unless showing is contemplated in the early Spring, when,
of course, an extra feed will be given at mid-day.The fashion has changed during the past few years as regards hay for
horses.Meadow hay is regarded, and rightly so, as too soft, so hard
seeds are invariably chosen by grooms or owners who want value for
money.It is quite easy to ascertain which a horse likes best by putting some
good hard mixture and equally well-gotten meadow hay side by side in
front of him.He will certainly eat that first which he likes best, and
it will be found to be the harder mixture.The quantities mentioned
are for foals which lie out or run on pasture.The best place for wintering them is in a paddock or field, with a
roomy shed open to the south.A yard, walled or slabbed on three sides,
the south again being open to the field, with doors wide enough to
admit a cart, is a very useful addition to the shed, as it is then
possible to shut the youngsters in when necessary.Both yard and shed should be kept littered, if straw is plentiful, but
if not the shed should contain a good bedding of peat-moss litter.No
overhead racks should be used, but one on the same level as the manger,
so that no seeds drop out of the rack into the colt’s eyes.It will be found that foals reared in this way are healthy and ready
for their feed, and they will often prefer to lie full length in
the open than to rest in the shed.To see them lying quite flat and
fast asleep, looking as if dead, is a pretty sure sign that they are
thriving.They will often snore quite loudly, so that a novice may
consider that they are ill.Rock salt should be within reach for them to lick, together with good
clean water.If a trough is used for the latter it should be cleaned
out at intervals, and if a pond or ditch is the drinking place, there
should be a stone mouth so as to avoid stalking in the mud.A healthy
horse is a hungry horse, therefore the feed should be cleaned up before
the next is put in.This must be noted in the case of foals just
weaned.Any left over should be taken away and given to older horses,
so that the little ones receive a sweet and palatable meal.Condition and bloom may be obtained by adding a small quantity of
boiled barley or a handful of linseed meal to the food above mentioned,
while horses lying in should have a boiled linseed and bran mash about
once a week.It should be remembered, as before stated, that horses are not like
cattle, sheep, or pigs, being fattened to be killed.They have a
comparatively long life in front of them, so that it is necessary to
build up a good constitution.Then they may change hands many times,
and if they pass from where cooked foods and condiments are largely
used to where plain food is given they are apt to refuse it and lose
flesh in consequence, thus leading the new owner to suppose that he
has got a bad bargain.Reference has already been made to the pernicious system of stuffing
show-animals, and it is not often that farmers err in this direction.They are usually satisfied with feeding their horses on sound and
wholesome home-grown food without purchasing costly extras to make
their horses into choice feeders.It is always better for the breeder of any class of stock if the
animals he sells give satisfaction to the purchasers, and this is
particularly true of Shire horses.A doubtful breeder or one which is
not all that it should be may be fattened up and sold at more than its
market value, but the buyer would not be likely to go to the same man
if he wanted another horse, therefore it is better to gain a reputation
for honest dealing and to make every effort to keep it.It might be here mentioned that it is not at all satisfactory to rear
a Shire foal by itself, even if it will stay in its paddock.It never
thrives as well as when with company, and often stands with its head
down looking very mopish and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is
not a suitable undertaking for a small holder, although he may keep
a good brood-mare to do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning
time.In the absence of a second foal a donkey is sometimes used as a
companion to a single one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory
playfellow, therefore the farmer with only one had far better sell it
straight from the teat, or if he has suitable accommodation he should
buy another to lie with it and rear the two together.Of course, two
will need more food than one, but no more journeys will be required to
carry it to the manger.Care should be taken, however, to buy one quite
as good, and if possible better, than the home-bred one.If they are to make geldings the colour should match, but if for
breeding purposes the colour need not necessarily be the same.Except
for making a working gelding, however, chestnuts should be avoided.It
is not a desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed enough of that
shade without buying one.A remark which may be also made with regard
to unsound ones, viz.that most horse-breeders get enough of them
without buying.During their second summer--that is as yearlings--Shires not wanted for
show purposes should be able to do themselves well at grass, supposing
the land is of average quality and not overstocked, but if the soil
is very poor it may be necessary to give a small feed once a day, of
which pulped mangolds may form a part if they are plentiful.This extra
feeding is better than stunting the growth, and the aim is to get a big
romping two-year-old colt, filly, or gelding as the case may be.Colts not up to the desired standard should be operated on during their
yearling days, preferably in May or June, and, as before indicated,
merit should be conspicuous in those left for stud purposes, while the
back breeding on both sides counts for much in a stallion.That is why
Lockinge Forest King, Childwick Champion, and a few others which could
be named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.After June or July colts should be separated from fillies unless the
colts have been castrated, and they must be put inside good fences,
this being something of a puzzle to a farmer with a few paddocks and
poor fences.Consequently, a second or third-rate young stallion often
causes a good deal of trouble, in fact, more than he leaves a return
for.For the second winter the young Shires still need a bit of help.If
they are to make, or are likely to make, anything out of the common
they should be fed liberally, otherwise a feed of chaff and corn once a
day will do, with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it must be good
wholesome forage.During their second spring, or when two years old, they should be put
to work as described in a former chapter, after which they are able at
least to earn their keep; the cost of rearing on the lines indicated up
to this age will be found to be considerable, so that a good saleable
animal is needed to make the business a profitable one; but I have kept
the rearing of good sound Shires in view, not crocks or mongrels.The effect of the war on the cost of feeding horses has led the Board
of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse owners
of substitutes for oats.When it was written beans were relatively
cheaper, so was maize, while rice-meal was recommended to form part of
the mixture, owing to its lower cost.Those who have fed horses are aware that they do not like any food
which is of a dusty nature.It sticks in their nostrils, causing them
annoyance, if not discomfort, which a horse indicates by blowing its
nose frequently.Any kind of light meal should therefore be fed either with damp chaff
or with pulped roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner described
elsewhere.If mangolds have to be purchased at £1 per ton, they help to
make the meals more palatable.The farmer who grows a variety of corn
and roots is usually able to prepare and blend his own foods so as to
make a diet on which horses will thrive although oats are scarce.In Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are largely used for farm horses,
but coal and labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.CHAPTER VII

CARE OF THE FEET


There is no part of a Shire to which more attention should be paid
than the feet, and it is safe to say that the foot of the present-day
cart-horse is infinitely better than were those of his ancestors of
forty, or even twenty, years ago.The shape as well as the size has
been improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is rarely met with, at least
in show animals of this breed.It is always advisable to keep the feet of foals, yearlings, and
two-year-olds attended to whether they are required for show or not,
and if they have their feet quietly picked up and the edges rasped, the
heels being lowered a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented from
breaking, and a better and more durable hoof well repays the trouble,
moreover the task of fixing the first set of shoes--which used to be
quite a tough job for the smith when the colts were neglected till
they were three years old--is rendered quite easy.Except for travelling on the road, or when required for show, there is
no advantage in keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they should be
taken off when lying idle, or if worked only on soft ground shoes are
not actually necessary.Where several are lying together, or even two, those with shoes on may
cause ugly wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with the naked hoof
is not often serious.There is also a possibility that colts turned
away to grass with their shoes on will have the removing neglected, and
thus get corns, so that the shoeless hoof is always better for young
Shires so long as it is sound and normal.If not, of course, it should
be treated accordingly.In a dry summer, when the ground is very hard, it may be advisable
to use tips so that the foot may be preserved, this being especially
necessary in the case of thin and brittle hoofs.For growing and preserving good strong feet in Shire horses clay land
seems to answer best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land farms
almost invariably possess tough horn on which a shoe can be affixed to
last till it wears out.For the purpose of improving weak feet in young Shires turning them out
in cool clay land may be recommended, taking care to assist the growth
by keeping the heels open so that the frog comes into contact with the
ground.Weakness in the feet has been regarded, and rightly so, as a bad fault
in a Shire stallion, therefore good judges have always been particular
to put bottoms first when judging.Horses of all kinds have to travel,
which they cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time if their
feet are ill-formed or diseased, and it should be borne in mind that
a good or a bad foot can be inherited.“No foot, no horse,” is an old
and true belief.During the past few years farmers have certainly paid
more attention to the feet of their young stock because more of them
are shown, the remarks of judges and critics having taught them that
a good top cannot atone for poor bottoms, seeing that Shires are not
like stationary engines, made to do their work standing.They have to
spend a good part of their lives on hard roads or paved streets, where
contracted or tender feet quickly come to grief, therefore those who
want to produce saleable Shires should select parents with the approved
type of pedals, and see that those of the offspring do not go wrong
through neglect or mismanagement.There is no doubt that a set of good feet often places an otherwise
moderate Shire above one which has other good points but lacks this
essential; therefore all breeders of Shires should devote time and
attention to the production of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering
the oft-quoted line, “The top may come, the bottom never.” In diseases
of the feet it is those in front which are the most certain to go
wrong, and it is these which judges and buyers notice more particularly.If fever manifests itself it is generally in the fore feet; while
side-bone, ring-bone, and the like are incidental to the front coronets.Clay land has been spoken of for rearing Shires, but there are various
kinds of soil in England, all of which can be utilized as a breeding
ground for the Old English type of cart-horses.In Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working red land, in Herts a
chalky soil prevails, yet champions abound there; while very light
sandy farms are capable of producing high-class Shires if the farmer
thereof sets his mind on getting them, and makes up for the poorness or
unsuitability of the soil by judicious feeding and careful management.It may be here stated that an arable farm can be made to produce a
good deal more horse forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,
therefore more horses can be kept on the former.Heavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne, etc., can be grown and mown
twice in the season, whereas grass can only be cut once.Oats and
oat straw are necessary, or at least desirable, for the rearing of
horses, so are carrots, golden tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an
arable-land farmer may certainly be a Shire horse breeder.This is getting away from the subject of feet, however, and it may be
returned to by saying that stable management counts for a good deal in
the growth and maintenance of a sound and healthy hoof.Good floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet in which roots appear,
moving shoes at regular intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not
rasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow shoe, may be mentioned as
aids in retaining good feet.As stated, the improvement in this particular has been very noticeable
since the writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but perfection
has not yet been reached, therefore it remains for the breeders of the
present and the future to strive after it.There was a time when exhibitors of “Agricultural” horses stopped the
cracks and crevices in their horses’ feet with something in the nature
of putty, which is proved by reading a report of the Leeds Royal of
1861, where “the judges discovered the feet of one of the heavy horses
to be stopped with gutta-percha and pitch.”




CHAPTER VIII

HOW TO SHOW A SHIRE


A few remarks on the above subject will not come amiss, at least to
the uninitiated, for it is tolerably certain that, other things being
equal, the candidate for honours which makes the best show when it is
actually before the judges stands the first chance of securing the
honours.It must not be expected that a colt can be fetched out of a grass field
one day and trained well enough to show himself off creditably in the
ring the next; and a rough raw colt makes both itself and its groom
look small.Training properly takes time and patience, and it is best
to begin early with the process, from birth for choice.The lessons
need not, and certainly should not, be either long or severe at the
outset, but just enough to teach the youngster what is required of him.When teaching horses to stand at “attention” they should not be made to
stretch themselves out as if they were wanted to reach from one side
of the ring to the other, neither should they be allowed to stand like
an elephant on a tub.They should be taught to stand squarely on all
fours in a becoming and businesslike way.The best place for the groom
when a horse is wanted to stand still is exactly in front and facing
the animal.The rein is usually gripped about a foot from the head.Mares can often be allowed a little more “head,” but with stallions
it may be better to take hold close to the bit, always remembering to
have the loop end of the rein in the palm, in case he suddenly rears
or plunges.The leader should “go with his horse,” or keep step with
him, but need not “pick up” in such a manner as to make it appear to
bystanders that he is trying to make up for the shortcomings of his
horse.Both horse and man want to practise the performance in the home paddock
a good many times before perfection can be reached, and certainly
a little time thus spent is better than making a bad show when the
critical moment arrives that they are both called out to exhibit
themselves before a crowd of critics.If well trained the horse will respond to the call of the judges with
only a word, and no whip or stick need be used to get it through the
required walks and trots, or back to its place in the rank.There is a class of men who would profit by giving a little time to
training young horse stock, and that is the farmers who breed but do
not show.Of course, “professional show-men” (as they are sometimes
called) prefer to “buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the polish
themselves, and then take the profits for so doing.But why should not
the breeder make his animals show to their very best, and so get a
better price into his own pocket?Finally, I would respectfully suggest that if some of the horse show
societies were to have a horse-showing competition, _i.e._ give prizes
to the men who showed out a horse in the best manner, it would be both
interesting and instructive to horse lovers.CHAPTER IX

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SHIRE


It is evident that a breed of comparatively heavy horses existed in
Britain at the time of the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s
warriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were on foot) in war chariots
drawn by active but powerful horses, remarkable--as Sir Walter Gilbey’s
book on “The Great Horse” says--for “strength, substance, courage and
docility.”

These characteristics have been retained and improved upon all down the
ages since.The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow down the
enemy was superseded by regiments of cavalry, the animals ridden being
the Old English type of War Horse.In those days it was the lighter or
second-rate animals, what we may call “the culls,” which were left for
agricultural purposes.The English knight, when clad in armour, weighed
something like 4 cwt., therefore a weedy animal would have sunk under
such a burden.This evidently forced the early breeders to avoid long backs by
breeding from strong-loined, deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,
seeing that slackness meant weakness and, therefore, worthlessness for
war purposes.It is easy to understand that a long-backed, light-middled mount with
a weight of 4 cwt.on his back would simply double up when stopped
suddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe at the head of his
antagonist, so we find from pictures and plates that the War Horse of
those far-off days was wide and muscular in his build, very full in his
thighs, while the saddle in use reached almost from the withers to the
hips, thus proving that the back was short.There came a time, however, when speed and mobility were preferred to
mere weight.The knight cast away his armour and selected a lighter and
fleeter mount than the War Horse of the ancient Britons.The change was, perhaps, began at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314.It is recorded that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that battle, on
which he dodged the charges of the ponderous English knights, and
he took a very heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of their
massive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable to suppose that some
of the latter were used for breeding purposes, and thus helped to build
up the Scottish, or Clydesdale, breed of heavy horses; but what was
England’s loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale breed had
a class devoted to it at the Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas
his English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive recognition by the
Royal Agricultural Society of England till 1883, sixty years later.As
a War Horse the British breed known as “The Great Horse” seems to have
been at its best between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the date of
Bannockburn above-mentioned, owing to the fact that the Norman nobles,
who came over with William the Conqueror, fought on horseback, whereas
the Britons of old used to dismount out of their chariots, and fight on
foot.The Battle of Hastings was waged between Harold’s English Army of
infantry-men and William the Conqueror’s Army of horsemen, ending in a
victory for the latter.The Flemish horses thus became known to English horse breeders, and
they were certainly used to help lay the foundation of the Old English
breed of cart horses.It is clear that horses with substance were used for drawing chariots
at the Roman invasion in the year 55 B.C., but no great development
in horse-breeding took place in England till the Normans proved that
warriors could fight more effectively on horseback than on foot.After
this the noblemen of England appear to have set store by their horses,
consequently the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be regarded
as the age in which Britain’s breed of heavy horses became firmly
established.In Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation showing that “Cart Horses
fit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot” were on sale at
Smithfield (London) every Friday, the extract being made from a book
written about 1154, and from the same source we learn that during the
reign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred stallions “of large stature”
were imported from the low countries--Flanders and Holland.Passing from this large importation to the time of the famous Robert
Bakewell of Dishley (1726-1795), we find that he too went to Flanders
for stock to improve his cart horses, but instead of returning
with stallions he bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,
these being of the old black breed peculiar--in those days--to
Leicestershire.There is no doubt that the interest taken by this great
breed improver in the Old English type of cart horse had an effect far
more important than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed of cattle,
seeing that this has long lost its popularity, whereas that of the
Shire horse has been growing and widening from that day to this.Bakewell was the first English stockbreeder to let his stud animals for
the season, and although his greatest success was achieved with the
Dishley or “New Leicester” sheep, he also carried on the system with
Longhorn bulls and his cart horses, which were described as “Bakewell’s
Blacks.”

That his horses had a reputation is proved by the fact that in 1785
he had the honour of exhibiting a black horse before King George III.James’s Palace, but another horse named “K,” said by Marshall
to have died in that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen years,
was described by the writer just quoted as a better animal than that
inspected by His Majesty the King.From the description given he
appears to have had a commanding forehand and to have carried his head
so high that his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore feet, as
Bakewell held that the head of a cart horse should.It can hardly be
questioned that he was a believer in weight, seeing that his horses
were “thick and short in body, on very short legs.”

The highest price he is credited with getting for the hire of a
stallion for a season is 150 guineas, while the service fee at home is
said to have been five guineas, which looks a small amount compared
with the 800 guineas obtained for the use of his ram “Two Pounder” for
a season.What is of more importance to Shire horse breeders, however, is the
fact that Robert Bakewell not only improved and popularized the Shire
horse of his day, but he instituted the system of letting out sires
for the season, which has been the means of placing good sires before
farmers, thus enabling them to assist in the improvement which has made
such strides since the formation of the Shire Horse Society in 1878.It is worth while to note that Bakewell’s horses were said to be
“perfectly gentle, willing workers, and of great power.” He held that
bad pullers were made so by bad management.He used two in front of
a Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being “four acres a day.”
Surely a splendid advertisement for the Shire as a plough horse.FLEMISH BLOOD

In view of the fact that Flanders has been very much in the public eye
for the past few months owing to its having been converted into a vast
battlefield, it is interesting to remember that we English farmers of
to-day owe at least something of the size, substance and soundness of
our Shire horses to the Flemish horse breeders of bygone days.Bakewell
is known to have obtained marvellous results among his cattle and sheep
by means of in-breeding, therefore we may assume that he would not have
gone to the Continent for an outcross for his horses unless he regarded
such a step beneficial to the breed.It is recorded by George Culley that a certain Earl of Huntingdon had
returned from the Low Countries--where he had been Ambassador--with a
set of black coach horses, mostly stallions.These were used by the
Trentside farmers, and without a doubt so impressed Bakewell as to
induce him to pay a visit to the country whence they came.If we turn from the history of the Shire to that of the Clydesdale it
will be found that the imported Flemish stallions are credited by the
most eminent authorities, with adding size to the North British breed
of draught horses.The Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous for their interest in horse
breeding.One was said to have imported six black Flemish stallions--to
cross with the native mares--towards the close of the seventeenth
century, while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported one, which he
named “Clyde.”

This is notable, because it proves that both the English and Scotch
breeds have obtained size from the very country now devastated by war.It may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders
of heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke
of Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the
Shire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which
have done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr.Robert Bakewell,
had the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)
before Royalty.Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland
Counties of England.So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a
winner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the
next station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the
likely animal.On at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,
so the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough
from the carriage window on the railway.Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr.Drew in
England was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.This horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he
also begot Lincolnshire Lad II.1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion
of the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion
in London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),
Markeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the
Shires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other
celebrities.Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,
by Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and
the dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all
of which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.There is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than
Flanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the
Flemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour
where it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read
of deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses
in Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing
feature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.CHAPTER X

FACTS AND FIGURES


The London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.The entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.This led to the
adoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two
entries in one class.The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the
number of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the
total being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in
the latter year than in the former.Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in
London was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of
charging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.Another innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered
for show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form
of certificate drawn up:--

    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr.________ for
    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,
    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the
    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),
    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,
    Sidebone, Shivering.”

These alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at
which the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited
by a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who
served on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).But to hark back to
the 1890 Show.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s
(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the
Sort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the
second-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.The Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr.R. N.
Sutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,
for 925 guineas to Mr.Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the
Shire Horse world for several years.Starlight rewarded him by winning
Champion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories
being a record in championships for females at the London Show.Others
have won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.In 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the
amount given in prizes being just over £700.A curious thing about that
1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of
£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their
thousands as they do now.The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and
the entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time
this is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of
1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her
Allies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been
carried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the
country cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression
that “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any
method of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally
to the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly
that which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among
members of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in
existence.At the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to
the prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two
geldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most
notable feature being that Mr.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won
the Challenge Cup for mares and died later.Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the
eldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,
the yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.But for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the
yearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age.At
this show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of
winning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other
two, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,
and son, viz.Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this
made the victory particularly noteworthy.The last named also succeeded
in winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.The cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours
the previous year for Mr.W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful
if a better gelding has been exhibited since.He was also cup winner
again in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the
London Show.It should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes
was introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced
from £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those
for mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each
breeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare
£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.This was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire
Horse Society and its London Show a lift up in the eyes of farmers
who had bred Shires but had not exhibited.Since then they have never
lost their claim on any good animal they have bred, that is why they
flock to the Show in February from all parts of England, and follow the
judging with such keen interest; there is money in it.This Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of the most important ever held.It marked the beginning of a more democratic era in the history of the
Great Horse.The sum of £1142 was well spent.By the year 1900 the prize money had reached a total of £1322, the
classes remaining as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for
mares, and two for geldings.The next year, 1901, another class, for
mares 16 hands 2 inches and over, was added, and also another class
for geldings, resulting in a further rise to £1537 in prize money.The sensation of this Show was the winning of the Championship by new
tenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs.J. and M. Walwyn, with an unknown
two-year-old colt, Bearwardcote Blaze.This was a bigger surprise than
the success of Rokeby Harold as a yearling in 1893, as he had won
prizes for his breeder, Mr.A. C. Rogers, and for Mr.John Parnell
(at Ashbourne) before getting into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore
great things were expected of him, whereas the colt Bearwardcote Blaze
was a veritable “dark horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one of
the judges, and subsequently purchased him for Lord Ellesmere.The winning of the Championship by a yearling colt was much commented
on at the time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary colt.The
critics of that day regarded him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.Said one, “We breed Shire horses every day, but a colt like this comes
only once in a lifetime.” Fortunately I saw him both in London and at
the Chester Royal, where he was also Champion, my interest being all
the greater because he was bred in Bucks, close to where I “sung my
first song.”

Of two-year-old champions there have been at least four, viz.Prince
William, in 1885; Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze, 1901; and
Champion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.Three-year-olds have also won supreme honours fairly often.Those
within the writer’s recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,
after being first in his class for the two previous years, and reserve
champion in 1891; Rokeby Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,
and cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in 1899, thus repeating his
two-year-old performance; Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the Royal
Champion as a two-year-old.The 1909 Show was remarkable for the successes of Lord Rothschild, who
after winning one of the championships for the previous six years, now
took both of the Challenge Cups, the reserve championship, and the Cup
for the best old stallion.The next and last three-year-old to win was, or is, the renowned
Champion’s Goalkeeper, who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the
second time.When comparing the ages of the male and female champions of the London
Show, it is seen that while the former often reach the pinnacle of
fame in their youth, the latter rarely do till they have had time to
develop.CHAPTER XI

HIGH PRICES


It is not possible to give particulars of sums paid for many animals
sold privately, as the amount is often kept secret, but a few may be
mentioned.The first purchase to attract great attention was that of
Prince William, by the late Lord Wantage from Mr.John Rowell in 1885
for £1500, or guineas, although Sir Walter Gilbey had before that given
a real good price to Mr.W. R. Rowland for the Bucks-bred Spark.The
next sensational private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the Royal
Champion of 1891, to Mr.Joseph Wainwright, the seller again being
Mr.John Rowell and the price 2500 guineas.In that same year, 1891,
Chancellor, one of Premier’s noted sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale at Calwich, when eighteen of Premier’s sons and
daughters were paraded with their sire, and made an average, including
foals, of £273 each.In 1892 a record in letting was set up by the Welshpool Shire Horse
Society, who gave Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan (the
champion of the 1891 London Show) to serve 100 mares.This society
was said to be composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected a good
return for their money.” Since then a thousand pounds for a first-class
sire has been paid many times, and it is in districts where they have
been used that those in search of the best go for their foals.Two
notable instances can be mentioned, viz.Champion’s Goalkeeper and
Lorna Doone, the male and female champions of the London Show of 1914,
which were both bred in the Welshpool district.Other high-priced
stallions to be sold by auction in the nineties were Marmion to Mr.Arkwright in 1892 for 1400 guineas, Waresley
Premier Duke to Mr.Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of Devonshire) for
1100 guineas at Mr.W. H. O. Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum
by the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s Hendre Crown Prince in the
same year.For the next really high-priced stallion we must come to the dispersion
of the late Lord Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley purchased the five-year-old Tatton Dray King (London Champion
in 1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated Devonshire stud.At this sale Tatton Herald, a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to
Messrs.Ainscough, who won the championship with him at the Liverpool
Royal in 1910, but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured, and won, as a
gelding.As a general rule, however, these costly sires have proved well worth
their money.As mentioned previously, the year 1913 will be remembered by the
fact that 4100 guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale for the
two-year-old Shire colt Champion’s Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion,
who, like Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to prove a good
investment at his cost.Twice since then he has championed the London
Show, and by the time these lines are read he may have accomplished
that great feat for the third time, his age being four years old in
1915.Of mares, Starlight, previously mentioned, was the first to approach a
thousand pounds in an auction sale.At the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late Mr.Philo Mills exhibited
Moonlight, a mare which he had purchased privately for £1000, but she
only succeeded in getting a commended card, so good was the company in
which she found herself.The first Shire mare to make over a thousand
guineas at a stud sale was Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold.This was at
the second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894, the price being 1010 guineas,
and the purchaser Mr.W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen, from whom
she was repurchased by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again
included in the Dunsmore catalogue of January 27, 1898, when she
realized 780 guineas, Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,
the word being used because she won the challenge cup in London, both
in 1899 and 1900.Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by Harold (London
Champion), dam by Staunton Hero (London Champion), she was sold at
King Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200 guineas.As a three- and
a four-year-old she was second in London, and she also won second
prize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A. Muntz, finally winning supreme
honours at nine and ten years of age, a very successful finish to a
distinguished career.On February 11th, 1898, another record was set by
His Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old filly Sea Breeze, by
the same sire as Bearwardcote Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J. Blundell
Maple again being the buyer.The next mare to make four figures at a
stud sale was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge sale of February
14, 1900, the successful bidder being Mr.H. H. Smith-Carington,
Ashby Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought and bred many good
Shires.This date, February 14, seems to
be a particularly lucky one for Shire sales, for besides the one just
mentioned Lord Rothschild has held at least two sales on February 14.In 1908 the yearling colt King Cole VII.was bought by the late Lord
Winterstoke for 900 guineas, the highest price realized by the stud
sales of that year.Then there is the record sale at Tring Park on
February 14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions Goalkeeper, made 4100
guineas, and another, Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.The honour for being the highest priced Shire mare sold at a stud sale
belongs to the great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir Arthur
Nicholson gave 1200 guineas at the dispersion sale of Mr.Max Michaelis
at Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911.It will be remembered by
Shire breeders that she made a successful appearance in London each
year from one to eight years old, her list being: First, as a yearling;
sixth, as a two-year-old; second, as a three-year-old; first and
reserve champion at four years old, five and seven; first in her class
at six.She was not to be denied the absolute championship, however,
and it fell to her in 1911.No Shire in history has achieved greater
distinction than this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won first prize
at the Royal Show six years in succession, as the competition in those
far-off days was much less keen than that which Pailton Sorais had to
face, and it should be mentioned that she was also a good breeder,
the foal by her side when she was sold made 310 guineas and another
daughter 400 guineas.Such are the kind of Shire mares that farmers want.Those that will
work, win, and breed.As we have seen in this incomplete review, Aurea
won the championship of the London show, together with her son.Belle
Cole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt which realized 900 guineas
as a yearling a few days before she herself gained her victory, a clear
proof that showing and breeding are not incompatible.CHAPTER XII

A FEW RECORDS


The highest priced Shires sold by auction have already been given.So a
few of the most notable sales may be mentioned, together with the dates
they were held--

    Dunsmore (dispersion), February 11, 1909:

                               84 Shires averaged   188  17    6

These ten are worthy of special mention, although there are several
which come close up to the £200 average.That given first is the most
noteworthy for the reason that Lord Rothschild only sold a portion of
his stud, whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton of Tatton
sold their whole lot of twenty-one head, hence the higher average.Two clear records were, however, set up at the historical Tring Park
sale in 1913, viz.the highest individual price for a stallion and the
highest average price for animals by one sire, seven sons and daughters
of Childwick Champion, making no less than £927 each, including two
yearling colts.The best average of the nineteenth century was that made at its close
by the late Lord Llangattock, who had given a very high price privately
for Prince Harold, by Harold, which, like his sire, was a very
successful stock horse, his progeny making a splendid average at this
celebrated sale.A spirited bidder at all of the important sales and a
very successful exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed in winning
either of the London Championships.One private sale during 1900 is worth mentioning, which was that of Mr.James Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon Extraordinary and Barrow
Farmer for 225 guineas each, a price which has only been equalled once
to the writer’s knowledge.This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.Truman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at Messrs.Manley’s Repository,
Crewe, this specimen of the English lorry horse being bought for export
to the United States.In 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a sale which possessed unique
features in that fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the dual
London Champion and Windsor Royal (Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner,
Prince William, to whom reference has already been made.As a great supporter of the old English breed, Lord
Wantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran, deserves to be bracketed with the
recently deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that in 1890 he gave
the Lockinge Cup for the best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,
which Starlight succeeded in winning outright for Mr.Sir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup for the best stallion, value
100 guineas, in 1884, which, however, was not won permanently till the
late Earl of Ellesmere gained his second championship with Vulcan in
1891.Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has continued to give
the Challenge Cups both for the best stallion and mare.The sales hitherto mentioned have been those of landowners, but it must
not be supposed that tenant farmers have been unable to get Shires
enough to call a home sale.A. H. Clark sold
fifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate, the average being £127 5_s._, the
striking feature of this sale being the number of grey (Thumper) mares.F. W. Griffin, another very
successful farmer breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,
the former’s average being £100 6_s._ 9_d._, and the latter’s £123
9_s._ 8_d._, each selling twenty-five animals.The last home sale held by a farmer was that of Mr.Matthew Hubbard
at Eaton, Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an average of £73 was
obtained for fifty-seven lots.Reference has already been made to Harold, Premier, and Prince William,
as sires, but there have been others equally famous since the Shire
Horse Society has been in existence.Among them may be mentioned Bar
None, who won at the 1882 London Show for the late Mr.James Forshaw,
stood for service at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a dozen
seasons, and is credited with having sired over a thousand foals.They
were conspicuous for flat bone and silky feather, when round cannon
bones and curly hair were much more common than they are to-day,
therefore both males and females by Bar None were highly prized; £2000
was refused for at least one of his sons, while a two-year-old daughter
made 800 guineas in 1891.For several years the two sires of Mr.A. C.
Duncombe, at Calwich, Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and in
those days the Ashbourne Foal Show was worth a journey to see.In 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first prize in London with a
big-limbed yearling, Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the sire
of strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which carried all
before them in the show ring for several years, and a three-year-old
son made the highest price ever realized at any of the Dunsmore Sales,
when the stud was dispersed in 1909.This was 1025 guineas given by
Lord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II.For four years in succession,
1903 to 1906, Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number of winners, not
only in London, but at all the principal shows.His service fee was
fifteen guineas to “approved mares only,” a high figure for a horse
which had only won at the Shire Horse Show as a yearling.Among others
he sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion
mare at the London Shows of 1912 and 1913.Jameson contained the blood
of Lincolnshire Lad on both sides of his pedigree.By the 1907 show
another sire had come to the front, and his success was phenomenal;
this was Lockinge Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage in 1889,
purchased by the late Mr.J. P. Cross, of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who
won first prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him in London as
a three-year-old, also first and champion at the (Carlisle) Royal
Show the same year, 1902.It is worth while to study the breeding of
Lockinge Forest King._Sire_--Lockinge Manners._Great grand sire_--Harold._Great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad II._Great great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).The dam of Lockinge Forest King was The Forest Queen (by Royal Albert,
1885, a great sire in his day); she was first prize winner at the Royal
Show, Nottingham, 1888, first and champion, Peterborough, 1888, first
Bath and West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other prizes.Her dam traced
back to (Dack’s) Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an authority
than the late Mr.James Forshaw described as “the sire of all time.”

This accounts for the marvellous success of Lockinge Forest King as a
stud horse, although his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late in
his life of ten years.We have already seen that he
has sired the highest priced Shire mare publicly sold.At the Newcastle
Royal of 1908, both of the gold medal winners were by him, so were
the two champions at the 1909 Shire Horse Show.His most illustrious
family was bred by a tenant farmer, Mr.John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,
Leicester.The eldest member is Halstead Royal Duke, the London
Champion of 1909, Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910, both owned
by Lord Rothschild, and Halstead Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup
in London for her breeder in 1912.The dam of the trio is Halstead
Duchess III by Menestrel, by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion, 1890).Two other matrons deserve to be mentioned, as they will always shine in
the history of the Shire breed.One is Lockington Beauty by Champion
457, who died at a good old age at Batsford Park, having produced
Prince William, the champion referred to more than once in these pages,
his sire being William the Conqueror.Then Marmion II (by Harold),
who was first in London in 1891, and realized 1400 guineas at Mr.Also a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at London Show
of 1889 for Mr.R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but, unfortunately, died from
foaling in that year.Another famous son was Mars Victor, a horse of
great size, and also a London winner, on more than one occasion.Freeman-Mitford (Lord
Redesdale) in the year of his sire’s--Hitchin Conqueror’s--championship
in 1890, for the sum of £1500.Blue Ruin was own sister to Prince William, but the other three were by
different sires.To look at--I saw her in 1890--Lockington Beauty was quite a common
mare with obviously small knees, and none too much weight and width,
her distinguishing feature being a mane of extraordinary length.The remaining dam to be mentioned as a great breeder is Nellie
Blacklegs by Bestwick’s Prince, famous for having bred five sons--which
were all serving mares in the year 1891--and a daughter, all by
Premier.The first was Northwood, a horse used long and successfully by
Lord Middleton and the sire of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall
Menestrel, London champion of 1904.The second, Hydrometer, first
in London in 1889, then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough, and
purchased when his stud was dispersed in 1893 by the Warwick Shire
Horse Society for 600 guineas.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for 1100 guineas, a record in those days,
to Mr.F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough Society in 1892 for
£500.Calwich Topsman, another son, realized 500 guineas when sold, and
Senator made 350.The daughter, rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr.John
Smith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal by Harold in 1893, which
turned out to be Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion stallion of 1897.This chapter was headed “A few records,” and surely this set up by
Premier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.The record show of the Shire Horse Society, as regards the number of
entries, was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the next for size was
the 1902 meeting when 860 were catalogued.Of course the smallest
show was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions and 34 mares made
a total of 110 entries.The highest figure yet made in the public
auction sales held at the London Show is 1175 guineas given by Mr.R. Heath, Biddulph Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming
King, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord Winterstoke, and sold by
his executors, after having won fourth in his class, although first
and reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old.He was sired by
Ravenspur, with which King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,
his price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke at the Wolferton Sale
of February 8, 1907, being the highest at any sale of that year.The
lesson to be learned is that if you want to create a record with Shires
you must begin and continue with well-bred ones, or you will never
reach the desired end.CHAPTER XIII

C., Newton Solney, Burton-on-Trent.Green, Edward, The Moors, Welshpool.Mackereth, Henry Whittington, Kirkby Lonsdale, Lancs.This list is interesting for the reason that those who have awarded
the prizes at the Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent, fixed the
type to find favour at other important shows.Very often the same
judges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the
same season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning
Shires.On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its
Council from as many counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection.For instance, Warwickshire--a great
county for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them--Mr.Potter--had recently come from Lockington
Grounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William.For many
years Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has
hailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number
of breeders of Shire horses.No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out.It is no light task, and nobody
but an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,
and Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,
whereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book
is 4200.The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their
old title of “War Horses.”




CHAPTER XIV

THE EXPORT TRADE


Among the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of
the Shire were the Americans.Very few London shows had been held
before they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take
across the Atlantic.Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse
Society granted 1264 export certificates.A society to safeguard the
interests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks
of Mr.A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in
his introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have
first-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour
to secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of
enhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England
and America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by
exercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to
pedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only
reap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to
this country.”

From the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June
3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of
Canada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the
merits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many
good Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was
118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United
States and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire
Classes.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done
is Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to
fifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be
extended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about
the stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore
they have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their
breeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to
extinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for
building up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred
re-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910
the number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if
the export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,
English breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British
Empire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial
prizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire
Horse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign
and Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES

The following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”
for 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--

    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is
    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal
    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,
    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,
    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in
    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire
    horses became known, and the more they came into competition
    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught
    purposes were appreciated.’

    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have
    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of
    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,
    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire
    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries
    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade
    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further
    development.The number of export certificates granted by the
    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal
    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire
    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,
    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,
    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and
    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a
    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,
    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,
    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more
    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present
    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings
    continue to be scarce and dear.”


THE NUMBER EXPORTED

“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year
or two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those
that go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is
worked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the
admiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,
except in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers
is to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than
on the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put
are also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very
high prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same
spirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal
could be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire
it is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is
unquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most
important horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the
breed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial
farmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a
similar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large
railway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a
binder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West
Territory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in
the stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are
keeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough
for their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only
kind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which
is certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the
native draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING

“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,
which is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire
horse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows
like Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at
the best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an
increase in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of
a thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;
but the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be
over, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have
declined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the
record average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general
average for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the
highest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being
1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre
Champion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and
Chancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,
1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases
of Mr.These figures show that the
worth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and
it is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is
by no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there
is ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in
view and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions
it behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American
word, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they
come to ‘the stud farm of the world.’

“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock
which has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly
emphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British
market being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of
males, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which
breeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood
famous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as
showing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after
year if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of
merit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply
of mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring
societies, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade
sires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,
and the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS

“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for
Shires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,
but from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either
forming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not
been responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable
that with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western
Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to
help the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be
useful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well
known, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an
average of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British
breeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest
fairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus
further the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the
export trade.”

It may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and
Lord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of
America for exhibition.CHAPTER XV

PROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS


Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge
cups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name
is mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show
of 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased
the second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.)He is
remembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short
legs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been
found at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan
and Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the
Filly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a
very high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,
which won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him
750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord
Rothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in
1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as
models of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in
1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win
highest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through
Lord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as
a two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,
so we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central
figure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Woldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the
Tring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire
Horse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased
Windley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the
Tandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the
Lockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir
Walpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King
blood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at
the Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a
brilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.
Ewart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at
Peterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt
deserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD

At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased
Dunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,
for 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won
second and third for him in London the same month, this being the first
show at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by
Messrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas
created quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so
for nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is
Mollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is
Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased
privately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines
is Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,
won first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards
selling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With
such animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,
although they do not come from the district known to the law makers of
old as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”


THE PENDLEY FEMALES

One of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at
the shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.J. G. Williams, Pendley
Manor, Tring.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under
notice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord
Egerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having
been first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest
Princess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup
winner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the
Tring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by
a female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest
King.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the
later acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and
reserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the
Royal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.Williams joined the
Shire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London
Championship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD

After Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that
the disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the
Edgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission
to the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,
1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and
half brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown
in London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry
in 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries
were made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize
yearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,
the own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold
Blue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize
yearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill
Forest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,
Ltd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.In future Edgcote
promises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its
Shorthorns.DUCAL STUDS

A very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace
the Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton
Nunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the
stud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke
of Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class
stud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker
Mars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the
Norwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912
for his popular owner.OTHER STUDS

Among those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old
English type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves
a foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of
stud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for
massive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree
which traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the
year 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire
weighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where
several sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave
860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he
sold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of
years, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by
Lord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen
to found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the
Shire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two
entries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which
reference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in
London, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall
Menestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild
as a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve
Champion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at
Shire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of
the Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion
honours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.A. Grandage, has
now been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,
his first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in
1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of
Lincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825
guineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,
seeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two
following years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are
likely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,
Highfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with
Rokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he
has taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and
has the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced
mare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second
highest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old
stallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London
ten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the
Winslow Shire Horse Society, and died.Another bad loss to Sir Arthur
and to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,
seeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest
King, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be
mentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,
first as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by
Redlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future
before the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame
achieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,
of Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore
Baronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for
the best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,
Danesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on
both occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of
admirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his
parade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but
Mr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove
otherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered
quite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of
high-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,
and a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge
(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.Salomons at the Tandridge
dispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of
1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury
Coronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his
class, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,
by the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both
being three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,
no matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who
has been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased
Danesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes
before re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes
Marathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and
fillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and
other meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,
Garstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,
King’s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won
first with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough
took first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and
mares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick
Champion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these
Lancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late
Mr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities
and keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged
in London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.This being a
record in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great
Show of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished
London winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom
(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the
Challenge Cup winning mare of 1907.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous
to mention in detail.Another very
impressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe’s
Premier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of
celebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a
great sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate
for thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw’s opinion
of him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton
sires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray
King, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when
sold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud
through several decades of last century, and that a large number have
been travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has
been done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the
influence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book
like this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that
they are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,
therefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz.Thomas
Ewart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud
of the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was
dispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of
which is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires
of Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at
Danesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking
over the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire
breeding quite successfully on his own account.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over
the Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let
the Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last
and worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate
means faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither
landowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be
mentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon
Menestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at
the 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,
who won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards
selling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree
with him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the
exhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable
horse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth
prize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter’s King’s Choice
above mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and
space permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his
best colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement
for the breed from a farmer’s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter
Gilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first
Shire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the
late Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by
Spark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby
sale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse
Society; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by
presenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering
1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)
at the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI

THE FUTURE OUTLOOK


This book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the
absorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is
the good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of
agriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a
certain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more
particularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three
seasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses
coming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together
with a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including
the weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no
provision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the
guns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and
most others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals
who have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered
mountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable
for mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or
drawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,
horse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,
particularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal
merchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry
users have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy
horses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they
have ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they
do, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the
necessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got
plenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,
“grow more wheat.”

If this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at
least to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,
that more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land
has to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home
and delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam
waggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or
standing idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare
does not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value
from the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years
old, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make
room for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and
most satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field
implements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of
the Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by
the Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--

“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live
stock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord
that Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the
rent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”

Most landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,
therefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have
done during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember
the Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth
seedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen.As long as there is
sowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.“Far back in the ages
      The plough with wreaths was crowned;
    The hands of kings and sages
      Entwined the chaplet round;
    Till men of spoil disdained the toil
      By which the world was nourished,
    And dews of blood enriched the soil
      Where green their laurels flourished:
    Now the world her fault repairs--
      The guilt that stains her story;
    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares
      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,
      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth
      Through endless generations,
    The art that calls her harvests forth
      And feeds the expectant nations.”

VINTON & COMPANY, LTD., 8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON, E.C.The French vine-growers seem at
last to have found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they
do half starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water
carefully to restore their vines to health.J. S. S., SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--I am not a stock man nor a farmer; but I have
some pecuniary interests, in common with others, my friends, in a Kansas
cattle ranch.I am therefore a good deal exercised about this
foot-and-mouth disease.Is it the terrible scourge reported by one cattle
doctor, who, according to the papers, says, "the only remedies are fire or
death."ANSWER.--The disease is a bad one, very contagious, but easily yields to
remedies in the first stages.THOMAS V. JOHNSON, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a report here that your draft
horses of all breeds are not crossing with satisfaction on your common
steeds in Illinois, and that not more twenty five in one hundred of the
mares for the last three years have thrown foal, nor will they the present
season.ANSWER.--Our correspondent has certainly been misinformed, or is an
unconscious victim of local jealousy, as he may easily convince himself by
visiting interior towns, every one of which is a horse market.BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.A neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and
sheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought
about his doing so.I asked him if he had read what THE PRAIRIE
FARMER and other papers had contained of late regarding foot-and-mouth
disease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa.He had not; did not take the
papers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.Then I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious
character, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your
brief history of the ailment in Great Britain.Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question
about buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards?Just this, I replied:
every day there are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of
cattle from these infected States.Perhaps some of them come from the very
counties where this disease is known to exist.The disease may break out
any day in scores of places in all these States.It may appear--indeed is
quite likely to do so at the stock yards.For aught I know it may be there
now.The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an
unwelcome fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to.In fact, from
what they have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent
enactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to
conceal cases that may really exist.Now you go there to pick up cattle to
consume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run
the risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost
you and your neighbors many thousands of dollars?If I were you I would
pick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though
not exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a
great deal more time and trouble.You see to a Man of the Prairie things
look a little squally in this cattle business.We have all got to be
careful about this thing.We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and
pasture gates, and we must guard them well.I am not an alarmist, but I
would run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always
tried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen.I am
in favor of _in_-trenchment.Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not
sound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it
till I hear more from the infected districts.To show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States this
way and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that it
knows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken
between the middle of November and the first of March.Still, these
Eastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live
in.Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do
their plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the
ground a bit.In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of
acclimated, as it were.We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,
good schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as
well as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in
December and January.We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or
Washington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest
where a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in
the year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have
the excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.I like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and Florida--for
other people who like to make their homes there, but my home is here and I
like it."I don't _have_ to" plow in winter, and I don't need to.I am
going to try to do my duty and be happy where I am, believing Heaven to be
just as near Illinois as any other State or any Territory.I read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near Omaha
burned the other night.With the barns were consumed twenty-six cows,
eighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and oats.In
all the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no insurance.From
all over the country and at all times of the year I read almost daily of
similar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands, and the closing
sentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements is "no
insurance."Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod
peddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and
these are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their
contents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in
sufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.True, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these
luxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has
brought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property
is swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my
family, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to
furnish them a shelter.I don't take _cheap_ insurance either, but invest
my money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant capital
and is cautiously managed.A wealthy man can take his fire risks in his
own hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means it seems
to me the height of folly to do so.I would rather go without tobacco or
"biled shirts" than insurance and lightning rods.I don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout.Certainly I never
heard of such a case.If one does get the ailment, however, if he keeps
bees he always has a sure remedy at hand.A German has discovered that if
a bee is allowed to sting the affected part, a cure is instantaneous.Why
don't Bismarck try this home remedy for his complication of gout and
trichinae?REMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the

[Illustration: Poultry Notes.]One of my correspondents writes: "My hens don't eat well--they just pick
over the food as if it were not good enough for them--and they don't lay
well; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope about--not as
if sick, but as if lazy."Probably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,
and the hens are getting tired of it.Hens are like other people--they
like a change of provender once in awhile--especially when confined
indoors.Sometimes over-feeding will cause indigestion, and then the
biddies will exhibit the symptoms you describe.In either case, let the
fowls fast for a whole day, and then for a few days feed lightly with food
that is different from what they have been living on.Give plenty of green
food, also Douglas' mixture in the drinking water twice a week.Another correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked food
to fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.I advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much
better for poultry than the raw articles would be.Because raw bugs and
worms constitute the "natural diet" of fowls in their wild state, it does
not follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most
economical food for our domestic fowls.Other things being equal, chicks
that are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and
thrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked rations.If you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the hens
do double duty.Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks come
out, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again.To do
this successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as dry
and given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves the
nest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go
back.Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and
the hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.A lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me
that she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for
information about advertising, packing eggs, etc.The advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy of
your "ad.," send it to THE PRAIRIE FARMER and other papers that circulate
among farmers, pay the bills, and answer the postals and letters as they
come.But if I were in your shoes, I would "put my foot down" on the
postals to begin with; they don't amount to anything anyway; the people
who ask a long string of questions on a postal card are not, as a rule,
the ones who become customers.Before we went into the poultry business an
old poultry-breeder said: "Don't have anything to do with postals, it
don't pay."We thought differently, but to satisfy ourselves, we kept
track of the postals, and to-day I have the addresses of over 300 people
who wrote us on postal cards.Just one, and he was an Ohio man.When I go into that branch of the
poultry business again, my advertisements will contain a postscript which
will read thusly: "No postals answered."And you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people who
have not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your prices,
etc., and you must answer them all alike.Here is where circulars save
lots of work and postage.I have sent you by mail what I call a model
circular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case.Pack
your eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg
separately in paper.The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.Put plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine
sew on a cover of stout cotton cloth.For the address use shipping tags,
or else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter
way.A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your
customer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.Concerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to
hatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: "I guarantee to furnish fresh
eggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely
any distance.In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly
cared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be
duplicated free of charge."I furnished just what I promised, and when a
total failure was reported I sent the second sitting free--though
sometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once
a man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the
first sitting hatched.But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty
well satisfied.It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a
sitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not
received the worth of his money.In such cases, if both parties are
willing to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all
will be satisfied.And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that
nothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly
as you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.If the lady who wrote from Carroll county, Illinois, concerning an
incubator, will write again and give the name of her postoffice, she will
receive a reply by mail.Although yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is
warm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands
will be upon the wing.It would be well on such days as this to see that
all entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way
of house-cleaning.This is all we think necessary for this month, provided
they have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom.Handling bees
tends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim
that this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast.Although more
young may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the
hive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the
death of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses.Sometimes,
also, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they
may fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.Bees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us that
insects during the larvae state consume more food than they do during the
remainder of their existence.Where a bee-keeper has been so improvident
as to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he should
examine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty frame,
substituting a full one in its place.Where frames of honey are not to be
had, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes, which
can be placed over the cluster.Care should be taken that no apertures are
left, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive.These cakes are
thought to excite bees less than when liquid food is given; they have
another advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them while feeding,
and do not get chilled.Bees that have been wintered in cellars, or special repositories, are
often injured by being removed too early to their summer stands.It would
be better to let them remain, and lower the temperature during warm days
with ice, until warm weather has come to stay.An aged veteran in Vermont
that we visited the season following the disastrous winter of 1880-81,
told us that his neighbors removed their bees from the cellar during a
warm spell early in spring, and they were then in splendid condition.He
let his bees remain until pollen was plentiful, and brought them out, all
being in fine order; by this time his neighbors' colonies were all dead.Good judgment and care must be exercised in removing bees from the cellar,
or disastrous results will follow.We know of an apiary of over one
hundred colonies that was badly injured, indeed nearly ruined, by all
being taken from the cellar at once on a fine, warm day.The bees all
poured out of the hives for a play spell, like children from school, and
having been confined so long together in one apartment had acquired, in
some measure, the same scent, and soon things were badly mixed.Some
colonies swarmed, others caught the fever, and piled up together in a huge
mass.This merry making may have been fun for the bees, but it was the
reverse of this for the owner, as many queens were destroyed, and hives
that were populous before were carried from the cellar and left without a
bee to care for the unhatched brood.When it is time to remove bees from the cellar the stands they are to
occupy should be prepared beforehand.They should be higher at the back,
inclining to the front; if the height of two bricks are at the back, one
will answer for the front.This inclination to the front is an important
matter; it facilitates the carrying out of dead bees and debris from the
hive, the escape of moisture, and last, and most important item, bees will
build their comb straight in the frame instead of crosswise of the hive,
and their surplus comb in boxes correspondingly.If a few hives are
removed near the close of the day and put in different parts of the
apiary, the danger from swarming out is avoided, for the bees will become
quiet before morning, and being far apart will not mix up when they have
their play spell.The success of bee-keeping depends upon the faithful
performance of infinite little items.L. L. Langstroth will be pained to learn that
he has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental work.May the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.During the last fall and winter he has been the light of many conventions,
and it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives of many
bee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming
countenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,
and taking the hand of this truly great and good man.L. HARRISON


Extracted Honey.A couple of copies of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have lately come to my desk, a
reminder of my boyhood days, when, in the old home with my father, I used
to contribute an article now and then to its columns.There is an old
scrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now, with some of those articles in
it, published nearly thirty years ago.But my object in writing now is to
add something to Mrs.Last year my
honey crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half of this was extracted, or
slung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it; but for next year I have
decided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the reason that I do not get
customers so readily for extracted honey.I have never extracted until the
honey was all, or nearly all, capped over, and then admitted air into the
vessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure of getting it "dry," and
proof against souring.This method has given me about half the amount
others obtained by extracting as soon as the combs were filled by the
bees, and ripening afterward.But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against
extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an
absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean
that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey
I have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to
candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a
permanent society, to be known as the Southern Wisconsin Bee-keepers'
Association.The following named persons were elected officers for the
ensuing year: President, C. O. Shannon; Vice-President, Levi Fatzinger;
Secretary, J. T. Pomeroy; Treasurer, W. S. Squire.The regular sessions of the association will be held on the first Tuesday
of March in each year.Special meetings will also be held, the time of
which will be determined at previous meeting.The object of the association is to promote scientific bee-culture, and
form a bond of union among bee-keepers.Any person may become a member by
signing the constitution, and paying a fee of fifty cents.The next
meeting will be held at the Pember house, Janesville, on the first Tuesday
in May at 10 o'clock A. M. All bee-keepers are cordially invited to
attend.The Secretary, of Edgerton, Rock Co., Wis., will conduct the
correspondence of the association.*     *     *     *     *

Loaned netting investors 7 per cent.In a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr.L. S.
Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: "Many thanks for your
instructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange
found in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give
employment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means
they could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that
you will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this
subject."Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:

"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette.The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between
Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per
cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,
and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea
water is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is
shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs.A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve.By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston.One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines.Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas.There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel.This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders.It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons.Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr.Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.DAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.[Illustration of a swing churn]

[Illustration: HOUSEHOLD.]For nothing lovelier can be found
  In woman than to study _household_ good.--_Milton._


How He Ventilated the Cellar.The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded to
at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb.A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas.In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family.W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:

"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr.Clapp, the president
of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any
milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar.I went and
looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter.Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.'I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.'He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered.You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day.The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar.I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar.This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy.It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that
we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but
conclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt
it to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands
will make use of Mr.As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country.As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest.The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said.At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband.She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning
fresh garments for her husband.The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;
and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous
perfumes.As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil
influences, it was disenchanted by various charms.After being thus
prepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered
unlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.The musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their
"Epithalamium."The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's
hands, symbolic of her now being mistress.A cake, too, baked by the
vestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from
the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided
among the guests.To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the
bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed
heartily a grand scramble.Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,
I think it must have been Smith, Mr.Smith said to her husband: "John, I really think we must
have the stove up in the sitting-room."Smith from behind his
newspaper answered "Well."Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr.Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr.Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help
her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some
words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the
stove down from the attic.Smith had placed the zinc in its proper
position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that
didn't matter.Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe.Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr.The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together.They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.Smith that a hammer was just the thing that
was needed, and he went for one.Brown improved the opportunity to
wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact
that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes
done in stove blacking.The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that
was needed, after all.Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of
the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became
exasperated and threw away the hammer.Brown's toe, and
that worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated.Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr.Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out.Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's.It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr.Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs.Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up.That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together.Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation.The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board.She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs.Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items.I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man.I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N.In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:

"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast
forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there.'It is
indeed an old place,' replied he.'We know it has stood there for 100 years
as the hunting home of the great St.John, but how long previous to that
we do not know.'"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands.On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded.'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he.'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much
greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air
was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,
was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and
sheep.I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the
sea-shore, how long ago this change took place?'In sooth, a strange
question!''This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.''Were there not of old,' said I,'many
great manufacturers in this city?''Never,' answered he,'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings."The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched
far into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with
many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could
not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof."Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not
perceive the slightest vestige of the city.I inquired of a very old and
saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone
upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed.'Is this a question,' said
he, 'from a man like you?Know ye not that cities are not now part of the
human economy?Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,
and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of
the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be
best for them.In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse
nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers
of any more value in growing the crops of the field.Electricity is
carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when
the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down
from the heavens by similar means.The influence of electricity has
destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and
beasts, and every living thing upon the earth.All things have changed,
and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting
place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'"Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly
way, "it's a perfect shame, Mr.G., that you never bring me home anything
to read!I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.""I think so, too," responded the unfeeling man.Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to
swallow, to stop its noise, "have magazines till they can't rest.""Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of
news in that!"and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor."I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man.Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.Mouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.The following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of

  With sky-blue ribbons to knot them together;
  A facing (at times) of bronze-brown tresses,
  Into whose splendor each furbelow presses;
  Two strings of blue to fall in a tangle,
  And chain of pink chin In decorous angle;
  The tip of the plume right artfully twining
  Where a firm neck steals under the lining;
  And the curls and braids, the plume and the laces.Circle about the shyest of faces,
  Bonnet there is not frames dimples sweeter!Bonnet there is not that shades eyes completer!Fated is he that but glances upon it,
  Sighing to dream of that face in the bonnet.--_Winnifred Wise Jenks._

  LITTLE DILLY-DALLY.I don't believe you ever
   Knew any one so silly
  As the girl I'm going to tell about--
   A little girl named Dilly,
     Dilly-dally Dilly,
      Oh, she is very slow,
     She drags her feet
     Along the street,
      And dilly-dallies so!She's always late to breakfast
   Without a bit of reason,
  For Bridget rings and rings the bell
   And wakes her up in season.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      How can you be so slow?Why don't you try
     To be more spry,
      And not dilly-dally so?'Tis just the same at evening;
   And it's really quite distressing
  To see the time that Dilly wastes
   In dreaming and undressing.Dilly-dally Dilly
      Is always in a huff;
     If you hurry her
     Or worry her
      She says, "There's time enough."Since she's neither sick nor helpless,
   It is quite a serious matter
  That she should be so lazy that
   We still keep scolding at her.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      It's very wrong you know,
     To do no work
     That you can shirk,
      And dilly-dally so.Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives.Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations.It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race.A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn.And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit.Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:

Professor--They tell me, Capt.Pennington, that you have been a good deal
in Patagonia.Uncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.Professor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and
their habits?Uncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir.Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of
'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.Professor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?Uncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest
tone of indifference--no, sir, they are not.(It was quite probable that
the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).The height of the
Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.Professor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?Uncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em.One day when the mate and I
were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate
and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet
nine inches and a half--that's their exact height.But, Captain, don't you suppose there
were giants there long ago, in the former generations?Uncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word.I'd heard that
story and I thought I'd settle it.I satisfied myself there was nothing in
it.Professor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants?Mightn't the former race have been giants?Uncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.Uncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual
moderation.The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and
went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.They all
measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in
'em--men, women, and all ages just the same.Five feet nine inches and a
half is the natural height of a Patagonian.Not a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's
Magazine_."Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper."None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger."Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with
pride.shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit."I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly."If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on.Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment."See me take
that old fellow over there!""Try it on the old woman I
was sitting with.She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.""Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?"Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose.But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard.She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive."She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly."She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and
the register of the progress of our race.The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Phoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions.The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet.The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Phoenician alphabet.For the second period, a sarcophagus found in
1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of
more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the
literature connected with it is overwhelming.An unbroken series of coins
extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew
engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,
early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor.The Aramaean alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East.Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet.The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes.Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion.The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about
half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs.The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated."Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on coming
home one evening; "will you help me keep it?""Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?"What could I do when my brother-officers
called--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?""Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?""You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch
it."Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening."Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?""No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some.Here, Willie, run to the
store, and tell them to send some bottles up."The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go."Come, Willie; why, what's the matter?He went, but came
back presently without any bottles."I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I
could not touch it.don't be angry; I told them to send it up,
but I could not touch it myself!"The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:

"Gentlemen, do you hear that?When the ale comes
you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not
another drop shall pass my lips.Willie, have you your temperance pledge?"And the boy was back with it in a moment.The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight.The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.Don't
touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.Stock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the

THE PRAIRIE FARMER is the Cheapest and Best Agricultural Paper published.He owned the farm--at least 'twas thought
   He owned, since he lived upon it,--
  And when he came there, with him brought
   The men whom he had hired to run it.He had been bred to city life
   And had acquired a little money;
  But, strange conceit, himself and wife
   Thought farming must be something funny.He did not work himself at all,
   But spent his time in recreation--
  In pitching quoits and playing ball,
   And such mild forms of dissipation.He kept his "rods" and trolling spoons,
   His guns and dogs of various habits,--
  While in the fall he hunted <DW53>s,
   And in the winter skunks and rabbits.His hired help were quick to learn
   The liberties that might be taken,
  And through the season scarce would earn
   The salt it took to save their bacon.He knew no more than child unborn,
   One-half the time, what they were doing,--
  Whether they stuck to hoeing corn,
   Or had on hand some mischief brewing.His crops, although they were but few,
   With proper food were seldom nourished,
  While cockle instead of barley grew,
   And noxious weeds and thistles flourished.His cows in spring looked more like rails
   Set up on legs, than living cattle;
  And when they switched their dried-up tails
   The very bones in them would rattle.At length the sheriff came along,
   Who soon relieved him of his labors.While he became the jest and song
   Of his more enterprising neighbors.Back to the place where life began,
   Back to the home from whence he wandered,
  A sadder, if not a wiser man,
   He went with all his money squandered.On any soil, be it loam or clay,
   Mellow and light, or rough and stony,
  Those men who best make farming pay
   Find use for brains as well as money._--Tribune and Farmer._


FRANK DOBB'S WIVES."The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that he
is a genius."And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel.It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing.Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none.He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes.He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete.Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world.You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits.He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way.Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work.So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in.If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master.The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell.He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him.He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly.So, with his pictures to
provide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived
the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically
despised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who
envied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by
most of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs.She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends.She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe.They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas.Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.He commenced the old life as if he had never been married.The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs.Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided.Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days.As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs.Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her.She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business.He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible.In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint.When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art.He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart.A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it.The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law.In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son.I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried.He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it.Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,
and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and
been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that
night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat.When he emigrated, with
his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off.They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of
the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular
in society.I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,
and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them."Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer.You remember Frank left some
things in my care when he went away?Yesterday I got a letter asking about
them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home."He did come home, and he settled in his old studio.What sort of a meeting
he had with his father this time I never heard.The old gentleman had been
paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he
kept up the payment still.But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he
ever needed help he did now.His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll.She had been an
heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated.Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe.In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to.In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future.So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy.She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist.She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain.The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling.One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him.D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper.We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics.From that day he was a changed
man.The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable.He
had lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to
the cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all.The
paternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and
they went into a boarding house.Inside of a month they were in the
papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs.Dobb's part against one of the
ladies of the house.A couple of days after he leased a little room
opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled
there for good.Such a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce.The studio had
long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over
it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs.D., like all
other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was
half-named from.Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,
littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them.Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a <DW12>.But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now.His light loves of
the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the
instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him.The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy.She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them.If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with.A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going.I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self.He was haggard
and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had
lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his
head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.The
fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which
hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too.Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was
smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.We
could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders.The disturbance
ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.We
ran to the door, in time to see Mrs.Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her
back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.We
posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of
the slippers which she had shed as she ran.The theatres were just out and
the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad
woman that she was.We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who
was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures.She seized
him by the arm and screamed out:

"I told you I would come with you."His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair.I
saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell.But he
slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and
said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and
scorn.We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world
staring at them.Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night."I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though.Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months.He
was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could
scarcely speak intelligibly."I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers.A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh."Why, because I
love her, damn me!"Is this what you came to tell me?""No," he answered, "of course not.The fact is, I want you to help me out
of a hole.That row last night has settled me with McGilp.He came to see
me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the
senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there.She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did.I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did.So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know.He's disgusted, and I don't blame him.Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy
days, one that he had picked up abroad.I was only too glad to take it and
a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,
I heard that he had levanted."Walked out this morning," said Smith, "and
sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the
city.She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the
other.She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going
to have her life, if she has to follow her around the world."She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though.There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again.Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the
Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan.She was promenading on
the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to
me as her husband.I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one.The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked.We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs.Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business.I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I
only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self.She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman.The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time.Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name.The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance."But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have loved
such a thing as he!X., that I never knew he had been
married till after he had fled?Then his father told me how he had courted
my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home.Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had
stolen you from me.The moment after I could have struck you dead at my
feet."She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger.I believed her, and
so would any one who had seen her then."I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him.Had the other woman
tired of him already?I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father
had told me, that he had fled alone?I answered the letter, and he wrote
again.Again I answered, and so it was kept up.For two years I played
with the love I now knew was worthless.He was traveling round the world,
and a dozen times wanted to come directly to me.I insisted that he should
keep his journey up--as a probation, you see.The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish.I could
see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him.I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled.She read the expression of my face, and laughed.And again she stabbed the air with her fan."But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence," I said."I had been divorced while I was writing to him.A year ago he was to be
in London, where I was to meet him.While he was sailing from the Cape of
Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all.Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself.He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened.He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked
at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.No
wonder the wretched vagabond loved her!What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him!I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot.Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as
Frank Dobb had never been.Her husband joined us and we made an evening of
it at the theatre.I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me.But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone.I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was.There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in
London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since.But some
months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has
been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7--."I have odd news for you," he wrote."You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home?Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw.He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street.He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece.I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it.I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."The following newspaper paragraph was appended:

"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr.Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here.He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name.He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States.All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step.The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr.J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."Bennerley Green, the West

Saskatchawan

FIFE WHEAT

It is the best wheat I ever raised or saw.I sowed one quart and got from
it three bushels of beautiful wheat weighing 63 pounds to the bushel,
which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol._Pub._ Like thee, my father, I adore my country,
 Yet weep with anguish o'er thy cruel chains._Reg._ Dost thou not know that _life_'s a slavery?The body is the chain that binds the soul;
 A yoke that every mortal must endure.Wouldst thou lament--lament the general fate,
 The chain that nature gives, entail'd on all,
 Not these _I_ wear?_Pub._              Forgive, forgive my sorrows:
 I know, alas!too well, those fell barbarians
 Intend thee instant death._Reg._                   So shall my life
 And servitude together have an end.----
 Publius, farewell; nay, do not follow me.--

 _Pub._ Alas!my father, if thou ever lov'dst me,
 Refuse me not the mournful consolation
 To pay the last sad offices of duty
 I e'er can show thee.----

 _Reg._                  No!--thou canst fulfil
 Thy duty to thy father in a way
 More grateful to him: I must strait embark.Be it meanwhile thy pious care to keep
 My lov'd Attilia from a sight, I fear,
 Would rend her gentle heart.--Her tears, my son,
 Would dim the glories of thy father's triumph.And should her sorrows pass the bounds of reason,
 Publius, have pity on her tender age,
 Compassionate the weakness of her sex;
 We must not hope to find in _her_ soft soul
 The strong exertion of a manly courage.----
 Support her fainting spirit, and instruct her,
 By thy example, how a Roman ought
 To bear misfortune.And be to her the father she will lose.I leave my daughter to thee--I do more----
 I leave to thee the conduct of--thyself.I perceive thy courage fails--
 I see the quivering lip, the starting tear:--
 That lip, that tear calls down my mounting soul.Resume thyself--Oh, do not blast my hope!Yes--I'm compos'd--thou wilt not mock my age--
 Thou _art_--thou art a _Roman_--and my son._Pub._ And is he gone?--now be thyself, my soul--
 Hard is the conflict, but the triumph glorious.Yes.--I must conquer these too tender feelings;
 The blood that fills these veins demands it of me;
 My father's great example too requires it.Forgive me _Rome_, and _glory_, if I yielded
 To nature's strong attack:--I must subdue it.Now, Regulus, I _feel_ I am thy _son_._Enter_ ATTILIA _and_ BARCE._At._ My brother, I'm distracted, wild with fear--
 Tell me, O tell me, what I dread to know--
 Is it then true?--I cannot speak--my father?_Barce._ May we believe the fatal news?_Pub._                                Yes, Barce,
 It is determin'd._At._ Immortal Powers!--What say'st thou?_Barce._                               Can it be?_At._                  Then you've all betray'd me._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS._Barce._                         Pity us, Hamilcar!_At._ Oh, help, Licinius, help the lost Attilia!_Lic._                     Ah!my fair mourner,
 All's lost._At._          What all, Licinius?Tell me, at least, where Regulus is gone:
 The daughter shall partake the father's chains,
 And share the woes she knew not to prevent.[_Going._

 _Pub._ What would thy wild despair?Attilia, stay,
 Thou must not follow; this excess of grief
 Would much offend him._At._                    Dost thou hope to stop me?_Pub._ I hope thou wilt resume thy better self,
 And recollect thy father will not bear----

 _At._ I only recollect I am a _daughter_,
 A poor, defenceless, helpless, wretched daughter!_Pub._                         No, my sister._At._ Detain me not--Ah!while thou hold'st me here,
 He goes, and I shall never see him more._Barce._ My friend, be comforted, he cannot go
 Whilst here Hamilcar stays._At._                          O Barce, Barce!Who will advise, who comfort, who assist me?Hamilcar, pity me.--Thou wilt not answer?_Ham._ Rage and astonishment divide my soul._At._ Licinius, wilt thou not relieve my sorrows?_Lic._ Yes, at my life's expense, my heart's best treasure,
 Wouldst thou instruct me how._At._                         My brother, too----
 Ah!_Pub._ I will at least instruct thee how to _bear_ them.My sister--yield thee to thy adverse fate;
 Think of thy father, think of Regulus;
 Has he not taught thee how to brave misfortune?'Tis but by following his illustrious steps
 Thou e'er canst merit to be call'd his daughter._At._ And is it thus thou dost advise thy sister?Are these, ye gods, the feelings of a son?Indifference here becomes impiety--
 Thy savage heart ne'er felt the dear delights
 Of filial tenderness--the thousand joys
 That flow from blessing and from being bless'd!No--didst thou love thy father as _I_ love him,
 Our kindred souls would be in unison;
 And all my sighs be echoed back by thine.Thou wouldst--alas!--I know not what I say.--
 Forgive me, Publius,--but indeed, my brother,
 I do not understand this cruel coldness._Ham._ Thou may'st not--but I understand it well.His mighty soul, full as to thee it seems
 Of Rome, and glory--is enamour'd--caught--
 Enraptur'd with the beauties of fair Barce.--
 _She_ stays behind if Regulus _departs_.Behold the cause of all the well-feign'd virtue
 Of this mock patriot--curst dissimulation!_Pub._ And canst thou entertain such vile suspicions?now I see thee as thou art,
 Thy naked soul divested of its veil,
 Its specious colouring, its dissembled virtues:
 Thou hast plotted with the Senate to prevent
 Th' exchange of captives.All thy subtle arts,
 Thy smooth inventions, have been set to work--
 The base refinements of your _polish'd_ land._Pub._ In truth the doubt is worthy of an African.[_Contemptuously._

 _Ham._ I know.----

 _Pub._ Peace, Carthaginian, peace, and hear me,
 Dost thou not know, that on the very man
 Thou hast insulted, Barce's fate depends?_Ham._ Too well I know, the cruel chance of war
 Gave her, a blooming captive, to thy mother;
 Who, dying, left the beauteous prize to thee._Pub._ Now, see the use a _Roman_ makes of power.Heav'n is my witness how I lov'd the maid!Oh, she was dearer to my soul than light!Dear as the vital stream that feeds my heart!But know my _honour_'s dearer than my love.I do not even hope _thou_ wilt believe me;
 _Thy_ brutal soul, as savage as thy clime,
 Can never taste those elegant delights,
 Those pure refinements, love and glory yield.'Tis not to thee I stoop for vindication,
 Alike to me thy friendship or thy hate;
 But to remove from others a pretence
 For branding Publius with the name of villain;
 That _they_ may see no sentiment but honour
 Informs this bosom--Barce, thou art _free_.Thou hast my leave with him to quit this shore.Now learn, barbarian, how a _Roman_ loves![_Exit._

 _Barce._ He cannot mean it!_Ham._                         Oh, exalted virtue!cruel Publius, wilt thou leave me thus?_Barce._                Didst thou hear, Hamilcar?Oh, didst thou hear the god-like youth resign me?[HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS _seem lost in thought_._Ham._ Farewell, I will return._Barce._ Hamilcar, where----

 _At._                 Alas!_Lic._ If possible, to save the life of Regulus._At._ But by what means?--Ah!_Lic._ Since the disease so desperate is become,
 We must apply a desperate remedy._Ham._ (_after a long pause._)
 Yes--I will mortify this generous foe;
 I'll be reveng'd upon this stubborn Roman;
 Not by defiance bold, or feats of arms,
 But by a means more sure to work its end;
 By emulating his exalted worth,
 And showing him a virtue like his own;
 Such a refin'd revenge as noble minds
 Alone can practise, and alone can feel._At._ If thou wilt go, Licinius, let Attilia
 At least go with thee._Lic._                 No, my gentle love,
 Too much I prize thy safety and thy peace.Let me entreat thee, stay with Barce here
 Till our return._At._              Then, ere ye go, in pity
 Explain the latent purpose of your souls._Lic._ Soon shalt thou know it all--Farewell!Let us keep Regulus in _Rome_, or _die_.[_To_ HAMILCAR _as he goes out_._Ham._ Yes.--These smooth, polish'd Romans shall confess
 The soil of _Afric_, too, produces heroes.What, though our pride, perhaps, be less than theirs,
 Our virtue may be equal: they shall own
 The path of honour's not unknown to Carthage,
 Nor, as they arrogantly think, confin'd
 To their proud Capitol:----Yes--they shall learn
 The gods look down on other climes than theirs.[_Exit._

 _At._ What gone, _both_ gone?Licinius leaves me, led by love and virtue,
 To rouse the citizens to war and tumult,
 Which may be fatal to himself and Rome,
 And yet, alas!_Barce._ Nor is thy Barce more at ease, my friend;
 I dread the fierceness of Hamilcar's courage:
 Rous'd by the grandeur of thy brother's deed,
 And stung by his reproaches, his great soul
 Will scorn to be outdone by him in glory.Yet, let us rise to courage and to life,
 Forget the weakness of our helpless sex,
 And mount above these coward woman's fears.Hope dawns upon my mind--my prospect clears,
 And every cloud now brightens into day.Thy sanguine temper,
 Flush'd with the native vigour of thy soil,
 Supports thy spirits; while the sad Attilia,
 Sinking with more than all her sex's fears,
 Sees not a beam of hope; or, if she sees it,
 'Tis not the bright, warm splendour of the sun;
 It is a sickly and uncertain glimmer
 Of instantaneous lightning passing by.It shows, but not diminishes, the danger,
 And leaves my poor benighted soul as dark
 As it had never shone._Barce._                 Come, let us go.Yes, joys unlook'd-for now shall gild thy days,
 And brighter suns reflect propitious rays.[_Exeunt._


 SCENE--_A Hall looking towards the Garden._

 _Enter_ REGULUS, _speaking to one of_ HAMILCAR'S _Attendants_.Ere this he doubtless knows the Senate's will.Go, seek him out--Tell him we must depart----
 Rome has no hope for him, or wish for me.O let me strain thee to this grateful heart,
 And thank thee for the vast, vast debt I owe thee!But for _thy_ friendship I had been a wretch----
 Had been compell'd to shameful _liberty_.To thee I owe the glory of these chains,
 My faith inviolate, my fame preserv'd,
 My honour, virtue, glory, bondage,--all!_Man._ But we shall lose thee, so it is decreed----
 Thou must depart?_Reg._                Because I must depart
 You will not lose me; I were lost, indeed,
 Did I remain in Rome._Man._                   Ah!Regulus,
 Why, why so late do I begin to love thee?why have the adverse fates decreed
 I ne'er must give thee other proofs of friendship,
 Than those so fatal and so full of woe?_Reg._ Thou hast perform'd the duties of a friend;
 Of a just, faithful, Roman, noble friend:
 Yet, generous as thou art, if thou constrain me
 To sink beneath a weight of obligation,
 I could--yes, Manlius--I could ask still more._Reg._                   I think I have fulfill'd
 The various duties of a citizen;
 Nor have I aught beside to do for Rome.Manlius, I recollect I am a father!my friend,
 They are--(forgive the weakness of a parent)
 To my fond heart dear as the drops that warm it.Next to my country they're my all of life;
 And, if a weak old man be not deceiv'd,
 They will not shame that country.Yes, my friend,
 The love of virtue blazes in their souls.As yet these tender plants are immature,
 And ask the fostering hand of cultivation:
 Heav'n, in its wisdom, would not let their _father_
 Accomplish this great work.--To thee, my friend,
 The tender parent delegates the trust:
 Do not refuse a poor man's legacy;
 I do bequeath my orphans to thy love--
 If thou wilt kindly take them to thy bosom,
 Their loss will be repaid with usury.Oh, let the father owe his glory to thee,
 The children their protection!_Man._                           Regulus,
 With grateful joy my heart accepts the trust:
 Oh, I will shield, with jealous tenderness,
 The precious blossoms from a blasting world.In me thy children shall possess a father,
 Though not as worthy, yet as fond as thee.The pride be mine to fill their youthful breasts
 With ev'ry virtue--'twill not cost me much:
 I shall have nought to teach, nor they to learn,
 But the great history of their god-like sire._Reg._ I will not hurt the grandeur of thy virtue,
 By paying thee so poor a thing as thanks.Now all is over, and I bless the gods,
 I've nothing more to do._Enter_ PUBLIUS _in haste_._Pub._                    O Regulus!_Pub._                       Rome is in a tumult--
 There's scarce a citizen but runs to arms--
 They will not let thee go._Reg._                     Is't possible?Can Rome so far forget her dignity
 As to desire this infamous exchange?_Pub._               Ah!Rome cares not for the peace, nor for th' exchange;
 She only wills that Regulus shall stay._Pub._              No: every man exclaims
 That neither faith nor honour should be kept
 With Carthaginian perfidy and fraud.Can guilt in Carthage palliate guilt in Rome,
 Or vice in one absolve it in another?who hereafter shall be criminal,
 If precedents are us'd to justify
 The blackest crimes._Pub._                 Th' infatuated people
 Have called the augurs to the sacred fane,
 There to determine this momentous point._Reg._ I have no need of _oracles_, my son;
 _Honour's_ the oracle of honest men.I gave my promise, which I will observe
 With most religious strictness.Rome, 'tis true,
 Had power to choose the peace, or change of slaves;
 But whether Regulus return, or not,
 Is _his_ concern, not the concern of _Rome_._That_ was a public, _this_ a private care.thy father is not what he was;
 _I_ am the slave of _Carthage_, nor has Rome
 Power to dispose of captives not her own.let us to the port.--Farewell, my friend._Man._ Let me entreat thee stay; for shouldst thou go
 To stem this tumult of the populace,
 They will by force detain thee: then, alas!Both Regulus and Rome must break their faith._Man._                                No, Regulus,
 I will not check thy great career of glory:
 Thou shalt depart; meanwhile, I'll try to calm
 This wild tumultuous uproar of the people._Reg._ Thy virtue is my safeguard----but----

 _Man._                                Enough----
 _I_ know _thy_ honour, and trust thou to _mine_.I am a _Roman_, and I feel some sparks
 Of Regulus's virtue in my breast.Though fate denies me thy illustrious chains,
 I will at least endeavour to _deserve_ them.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ How is my country alter'd!how, alas,
 Is the great spirit of old Rome extinct!_Restraint_ and _force_ must now be put to use
 To _make_ her virtuous.She must be _compell'd_
 To faith and honour.--Ah!And dost thou leave so tamely to my friend
 The honour to assist me?Go, my boy,
 'Twill make me _more_ in love with chains and death,
 To owe them to a _son_._Pub._                    I go, my father--
 I will, I will obey thee._Reg._                    Do not sigh----
 One sigh will check the progress of thy glory._Pub._ Yes, I will own the pangs of death itself
 Would be less cruel than these agonies:
 Yet do not frown austerely on thy son:
 His anguish is his virtue: if to conquer
 The feelings of my soul were easy to me,
 'Twould be no merit.Do not then defraud
 The sacrifice I make thee of its worth.[_Exeunt severally._


    MANLIUS, ATTILIA._At._ (_speaking as she enters._)
 Where is the Consul?--Where, oh, where is Manlius?I come to breathe the voice of mourning to him,
 I come to crave his mercy, to conjure him
 To whisper peace to my afflicted bosom,
 And heal the anguish of a wounded spirit._Man._ What would the daughter of my noble friend?_At._ (_kneeling._)
 If ever pity's sweet emotions touch'd thee,--
 If ever gentle love assail'd thy breast,--
 If ever virtuous friendship fir'd thy soul--
 By the dear names of husband and of parent--
 By all the soft, yet powerful ties of nature--
 If e'er thy lisping infants charm'd thine ear,
 And waken'd all the father in thy soul,--
 If e'er thou hop'st to have thy latter days
 Blest by their love, and sweeten'd by their duty--
 Oh, hear a kneeling, weeping, wretched daughter,
 Who begs a father's life!--nor hers alone,
 But Rome's--his country's father._Man._                                Gentle maid!Oh, spare this soft, subduing eloquence!--
 Nay, rise.I shall forget I am a Roman--
 Forget the mighty debt I owe my country--
 Forget the fame and glory of thy father.[_Turns from her._

 _At._ (_rises eagerly._)            Ah!Indulge, indulge, my Lord, the virtuous softness:
 Was ever sight so graceful, so becoming,
 As pity's tear upon the hero's cheek?_Man._ No more--I must not hear thee.[_Going._

 _At._                    How!You must--you shall--nay, nay return, my Lord--
 Oh, fly not from me!----look upon my woes,
 And imitate the mercy of the gods:
 'Tis not their thunder that excites our reverence,
 'Tis their mild mercy, and forgiving love.'Twill add a brighter lustre to thy laurels,
 When men shall say, and proudly point thee out,
 "Behold the Consul!--He who sav'd his friend."Oh, what a tide of joy will overwhelm thee!_Man._ Thy father scorns his liberty and life,
 Nor will accept of either at the expense
 Of honour, virtue, glory, faith, and Rome._At._ Think you behold the god-like Regulus
 The prey of unrelenting savage foes,
 Ingenious only in contriving ill:----
 Eager to glut their hunger of revenge,
 They'll plot such new, such dire, unheard-of tortures--
 Such dreadful, and such complicated vengeance,
 As e'en the Punic annals have not known;
 And, as they heap fresh torments on his head,
 They'll glory in their genius for destruction.Manlius--now methinks I see my father--
 My faithful fancy, full of his idea,
 Presents him to me--mangled, gash'd, and torn--
 Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony--
 The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh,
 While the dire murderers smile upon his wounds,
 His groans their music, and his pangs their sport.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!_Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--
 To keep unstain'd the glory of these chains--
 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _Reg._ Is a most painful virtue;--but Attilia
 Is Regulus's daughter, and must have it._At._ I will entreat the gods to give it me._Reg._ Is this concern a mark that thou hast lost it?I cannot, cannot spurn my weeping child.Receive this proof of my paternal fondness;--
 Thou lov'st Licinius--he too loves my daughter.I give thee to his wishes; I do more--
 I give thee to his virtues.--Yes, Attilia,
 The noble youth deserves this dearest pledge
 Thy father's friendship ever can bestow.wilt thou, canst thou leave me?_Reg._ I am, I am thy father!as a proof,
 I leave thee my example how to suffer.I have a heart within this bosom;
 That heart has passions--see in what we differ;
 Passion--which is thy tyrant--is my slave.Ah!--

 _Reg._                       Farewell![_Exit._

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,
 Thy mighty spirit struggling in this breast,
 And it shall conquer all these coward feelings,
 It shall subdue the woman in my soul;
 A Roman virgin should be something more--
 Should dare above her sex's narrow limits--
 And I will dare--and mis'ry shall assist me--
 My father!The hero shall no more disdain his child;
 Attilia shall not be the only branch
 That yields dishonour to the parent tree.is it true that Regulus,
 In spite of senate, people, augurs, friends,
 And children, will depart?_At._                       Yes, it is true._At._                                You forget--
 Barce!_Barce._ Dost thou approve a virtue which must lead
 To chains, to tortures, and to certain death?those chains, those tortures, and that death,
 Will be his triumph._Barce._                Thou art pleas'd, Attilia:
 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".THE REVERSE

The reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the
rotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to
alternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the
turning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of
alternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see
preparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the
gentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole
turn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the
turn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,
and in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,
than that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure
to reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised
until one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The
writer has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only
helpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in
obviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent
unpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]

After acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to
Mazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of
Spanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more
liquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of
Danglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is
always opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,
the weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the
weight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the
dancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be
held back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round
dances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a
unique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement
becomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,
in order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for
greater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if
there were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more
difficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of
walking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a
whole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single
hour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its
physical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance
that we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the
maximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This
tends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at
the same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The
movements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps
which is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and
support the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of
the social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which
are now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely
refining influence of the action.[Illustration]

Of the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond
the description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated
in the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete
understanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further
the proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's
part.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._


THE LONG BOSTON

The ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is
commonly known as the "Long" Boston to distinguish it from other forms
and variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and
at any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it
should be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]


THE SHORT BOSTON

The "Short" Boston differs from the "Long" Boston only in measure.It is
danced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)
occupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements
each occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between
the "Long" and the "Short" Boston the same difference as between the
Waltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the "Short" Boston, the
rising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take
the form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less
fatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON

The "Open" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first
part is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages
8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the "Long"
Boston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,
without turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to
face directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the
position shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one
Boston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz
Position for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]


THE BOSTON DIP

The "Dip" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4
measures of the "Long" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:

Standing upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the
weight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in
front of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);
lower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original
place where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across
in front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the
left heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side
of the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across
in front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down
the left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it
(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and
finish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives
the weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the
movement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly
coincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]




THE TURKEY TROT

_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._


During the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning
(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,
stretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as
shown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)
swaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and
pointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *

  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in "The Gobbler" by
  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE


The "Aeroplane Glide" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed
to represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its
name from that fact.The sole difference between the "Dip" and "Aeroplane" consists in the
six running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running
steps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before
and behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure
requires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is
noticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the "Dip".[Illustration]




THE TANGO


The Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the
peculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends
largely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the
music as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,
and the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend
themselves most readily to verbal description.1

The partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes
the lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full
extent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand
upon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration
opposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and
steps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows
forward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing
one foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same
direction.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the
whole is repeated at will.[Illustration]


TANGO No.2

This variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman
takes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two
steps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two
steps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as
the feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the
whole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE "BOSTON"

  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.They were too glad of the chance to clip and
shear me.While I was in the provost they found newspapers in my bag I
was not allowed to read--and pamphlets I was not allowed to read--that
shut the door--otherwise they would have given me only third class----

KNEIR.Newspapers you were not allowed to read?Why--simple soul--Ach!--when I look at your submissive face I
see no way to tell why--Why do men desert?--Why, ten days before this
happened to me, did Peter the stoker cut off his two fingers?--Just
for a joke?I can't blame you people--you knew no
better--and I admired the uniform--But now that I've got some brains
I would like to warn every boy that binds himself for fourteen years
to murder.Boy, don't say such dreadful things--you are
excited----

GEERT.No--not at all--worn out, in fact--in Atjeh I fought
with the rest--stuck my bayonet into the body of a poor devil till the
blood spurted into my eyes--For that they gave me the Atjeh medal.[Jo picks up the bundle;
Barend looks on.][Jerks the medal from his
jacket, throws it out of the window.]you have dangled on my
breast long enough!I no longer know
you----

GEERT.Who--who took an innocent boy, that couldn't count ten, and
kidnaped him for fourteen years?Who drilled and trained him for a
dog's life?Who put him in irons when he defended his girl?Irons--you
should have seen me walking in them, groaning like an animal.Near me
walked another animal with irons on his leg, because of an insolent
word to an officer of the watch.Six days with the damned irons on
your claws and no power to break them.Don't talk about it any more, you are still so tired----

GEERT.[Wrapped in the grimness of his story.]Then the provost,
that stinking, dark cage; your pig stye is a palace to it.A cage
with no windows--no air--a cage where you can't stand or lie down.A
cage where your bread and water is flung to you with a "there, dog,
eat!"There was a big storm in those days,--two sloops were battered to
pieces;--when you expected to go to the bottom any moment.Never again
to see anyone belongin' to me--neither you--nor you--nor you.To go
down in that dark, stinking hole with no one to talk to--no comrade's
hand!--No, no, let me talk--it lightens my chest!A fellow has lots to
bring in there.Gold
epaulettes sitting in judgment on the trash God has kicked into the
world to serve, to salute, to----

KNEIR.Six months--six months in a cell for reformation.To be reformed
by eating food you could not swallow;--rye bread, barley, pea soup,
rats!Three months I pasted paper bags, and when I saw the chance I
ate the sour paste from hunger.Three months I sorted peas; you'll
not believe it, but may I never look on the sea again if I lie.At
night, over my gas light, I would cook the peas I could nip in my
slop pail.When the handle became too hot to hold any longer, I ate
them half boiled--to fill my stomach.That's to reform you--reform
you--for losing your temper and licking a blackguard that called your
girl a vile name, and reading newspapers you were not allowed to read.Fresh from the sea--in a cell--no
wind and no water, and no air--one small high window with grating like
a partridge cage.The foul smell and the nights--the damned nights,
when you couldn't sleep.When you sprang up and walked, like an insane
man, back and forth--back and forth--four measured paces.The nights
when you sat and prayed not to go insane--and cursed everything,
everything, everything![After a long pause goes to him and throws her arms about his
neck.Kneirtje weeps, Barend stands dazed.]Don't let us--[Forcibly controlling his tears.][Goes to the window--says to Barend.]Lay
out the good things--[Draws up the curtain.]if the
rooster isn't sitting on the roof again, ha, ha, ha!I would like to sail at once--two days on the Sea!the
Sea!--and I'm my old self again.What?--Why is Truus crying as she
walks by?Ssst!--Don't call after her.The Anna has just come in without
her husband.[A few sad-looking, low-speaking women walk past the
window.][Drops the window
curtain, stands in somber thought.]That is to say----

MARIETJE.Yes--I won't go far--I must----

MARIETJE.Well, Salamander, am I a child?I must--I must----[Abruptly
off.]You should have seen him day before yesterday--half the
village at his heels.When Mother was living he didn't
dare.She used to slap his face for him when he smelled of gin--just
let me try it.You say that as though--ha ha ha!I never have seen Mees drinking--and father very seldom
formerly.Ah well--I can't put a cork in his mouth, nor lead him
around by a rope.Gone, of course--to
the Rooie.Young for her years, isn't she, eh?Sit down and tell me
[Merrily.]You know we would
like to marry at once [Smiles, hesitates.]because--because----Well,
you understand.But Mees had to send for his papers first--that takes
two weeks--by that time he is far out at sea; now five weeks--five
little weeks will pass quickly enough.That's about the same----Are you two!----Now?----I told
you everything----

[Jo shrugs her shoulders and laughs.]May you live to be a hundred----

KNEIR.You may try one--you, too--gingerbread nuts--no,
not two, you, with the grab-all fingers!For each of the boys a
half pound gingerbread nuts--and a half pound chewing tobacco--and
a package of cigars.Do you know what I'm going to give Barend since
he has become so brave--look----

JO.Now--you should give those to Geert----

KNEIR.No, I'm so pleased with the lad that he has made up his mind
I want to reward him.These are ever so old, they are earrings.My
husband wore them Sundays, when he was at home.There are little ships on them--masts--and sails--I wish
I had them for a brooch.You had a time getting him to sign--Eh!But he was willing to go with his brother--and
now take it home to yourself--a boy that is not strong--not very
strong--rejected for the army, and a boy who heard a lot about his
father and Josef.First you curse and scold at him, and
now nothing is too good.In an hour he will be gone,
and you must never part in anger.We
have fresh wafers and ginger cakes all laid in for my birthday--set it
all ready, Jo.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.The report of that wonderful cure caused many intelligent laymen (and even
Dr.Pratt) to indulge a hope that insanity might be only a disturbance of
the blood supply to the brain caused by pressure from distorted "neck
bones," or other lesions, and that Osteopaths were to empty our
overcrowded madhouses.I
was told by an intimate friend of this great Osteopath that all these
startling reports we had supposed were published as news the papers were
glad to get because of their important truths, were but shrewd
advertising.I afterward talked with the man, and his friends who were at
the bedside when the miracle was performed, and while they believed that
there had been good done by the treatment, it was all so tame and
commonplace at home compared with its fame abroad that I have wondered
ever since if anything much was really done after all.Honesty--Plain Dealing--Education.I could multiply incidents, but it would grow
monotonous.I believe I have told enough that is disgusting to the
intelligent laity and medical men, and enough that is humiliating to the
capable, honest Osteopath, who practices his "new science" as standing for
all that is good in physio-therapy.I hope I have told, or recalled, something that will help physicians to
see that the way to clear up the turbidity existing in therapeutics to-day
is by open, honest dealing with the laity, and by a campaign of education
that shall impart to them enough of the scientific principles of medicine
so that they may know when they are being imposed upon by quacks and
grafters.I am encouraged to believe I am on the right track.After I had
written this booklet I read, in a report of the convention of the American
Medical Association held in Chicago, that one of the leaders of the
Association told his brethren that the most important work before them as
physicians was to conduct a campaign of education for the masses.It must
be done not only to protect the people, but as well to protect the honest
physician.There is another fact that faces the medical profession, and I believe I
have called attention to conditions that prove it.That is, that the hope
of the profession of "doctoring" being placed on an honest rational basis
lies in a broader and more thorough education of the physician.A broad,
liberal general education to begin with, then all that can be known about
medicine and surgery.Then all that there is in
physio-therapy, under whatsoever name, that promises to aid in curing or
preventing disease.If this humble production aids but a little in any of this great work,
then my object in writing will have been achieved.Boy         14             13/4  "     35c      "

BAKER, Hamilton Place, Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:

    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.The bevelling will, if possible, be in every direction, that is
to say, upwards at the top, outwards at the sides, and downwards at the
bottom, but essentially _downwards_; the earth and the doings upon it
being the chief object in outlook windows, except of observatories; and
where the object is a distinct and special view downwards, it will be of
advantage to shelter the eye as far as possible from the rays of light
coming from above, and the head of the window may be left horizontal, or
even the whole aperture sloped outwards, as the slit in a letter-box
is inwards.The best windows for outlook are, of course, oriels and bow windows, but
these are not to be considered under the head of apertures merely; they
are either balconies roofed and glazed, and to be considered under the
head of external appliances, or they are each a story of an external
semi-tower, having true aperture windows on each side of it.These windows may, of course, be of any shape
and size whatever, according to the other necessities of the building, and
the quantity and direction of light desired, their purpose being now to
throw it in streams on particular lines or spots; now to diffuse it
everywhere; sometimes to introduce it in broad masses, tempered in
strength, as in the cathedral  window; sometimes in starry
showers of scattered brilliancy, like the apertures in the roof of an
Arabian bath; perhaps the most beautiful of all forms being the rose,
which has in it the unity of both characters, and sympathy with that of
the source of light itself.It is noticeable, however, that while both
the circle and pointed oval are beautiful window forms, it would be very
painful to cut either of them in half and connect them by vertical
lines, as in Fig.The reason is, I believe, that so treated, the
upper arch is not considered as connected with the lower, and forming an
entire figure, but as the ordinary arch roof of the aperture, and the
lower arch as an arch _floor_, equally unnecessary and unnatural.Also,
the elliptical oval is generally an unsatisfactory form, because it
gives the idea of useless trouble in building it, though it occurs
quaintly and pleasantly in the former windows of France: I believe it is
also objectionable because it has an indeterminate, slippery look, like
that of a bubble rising through a fluid.It, and all elongated forms,
are still more objectionable placed horizontally, because this is the
weakest position they can structurally have; that is to say, less light
is admitted, with greater loss of strength to the building, than by any
other form.If admissible anywhere, it is for the sake of variety at the
top of the building, as the flat parallelogram sometimes not
ungracefully in Italian Renaissance.The question of bevelling becomes a little more complicated in
the inlet than the outlook window, because the mass or quantity of light
admitted is often of more consequence than its direction, and often
_vice versa_; and the outlook window is supposed to be approachable,
which is far from being always the case with windows for light, so that
the bevelling which in the outlook window is chiefly to open range of
sight, is in the inlet a means not only of admitting the light in
greater quantity, but of directing it to the spot on which it is to
fall.But, in general, the bevelling of the one window will reverse that
of the other; for, first, no natural light will strike on the inlet
window from beneath, unless reflected light, which is (I believe)
injurious to the health and the sight; and thus, while in the outlook
window the outside bevel downwards is essential, in the inlet it would
be useless: and the sill is to be flat, if the window be on a level with
the spot it is to light; and sloped downwards within, if above it.Again, as the brightest rays of light are the steepest, the outside
bevel upwards is as essential in the roof of the inlet as it was of
small importance in that of the outlook window.On the horizontal section the aperture will expand internally,
a somewhat larger number of rays being thus reflected from the jambs; and
the aperture being thus the smallest possible outside, this is the
favorite military form of inlet window, always found in magnificent
development in the thick walls of mediaeval castles and convents.Its
effect is tranquil, but cheerless and dungeon-like in its fullest
development, owing to the limitation of the range of sight in the
outlook, which, if the window be unapproachable, reduces it to a mere
point of light.A modified condition of it, with some combination of the
outlook form, is probably the best for domestic buildings in general
(which, however, in modern architecture, are unhappily so thin walled,
that the outline of the jambs becomes a matter almost of indifference),
it being generally noticeable that the depth of recess which I have
observed to be essential to nobility of external effect has also a
certain dignity of expression, as appearing to be intended rather to
admit light to persons quietly occupied in their homes, than to
stimulate or favor the curiosity of idleness.FOOTNOTES:

  [55] And worth questioning, also, whether the triple porch has not
    been associated with Romanist views of mediatorship; the Redeemer
    being represented as presiding over the central door only, and the
    lateral entrances being under the protection of saints, while the
    Madonna almost always has one or both of the transepts.But it would
    be wrong to press this, for, in nine cases out of ten, the architect
    has been merely influenced in his placing of the statues by an
    artist's desire of variety in their forms and dress; and very
    naturally prefers putting a canonisation over one door, a martyrdom
    over another, and an assumption over a third, to repeating a
    crucifixion or a judgment above all.The architect's doctrine is
    only, therefore, to be noted with indisputable reprobation when the
    Madonna gets possession of the main door.[56] The arch heading is indeed the best where there is much
    incumbent weight, but a window frequently has very little weight
    above it, especially when placed high, and the arched form loses
    light in a low room: therefore the square-headed window is
    admissible where the square-headed door is not.[57] I do not like the sound of the word "splayed;" I always shall
    use "bevelled" instead.I. Thus far we have been concerned with the outline only of the
aperture: we were next, it will be remembered, to consider the necessary
modes of filling it with valves in the case of the door, or with glass
or tracery in that of the window.We concluded, in the previous Chapter, that doors
in buildings of any importance or size should have headings in the form
of an arch.This is, however, the most inconvenient form we could
choose, as respects the fitting of the valves of the doorway; for the
arch-shaped head of the valves not only requires considerable nicety in
fitting to the arch, but adds largely to the weight of the door,--a
double disadvantage, straining the hinges and making it cumbersome in
opening.And this inconvenience is so much perceived by the eye, that a
door valve with a pointed head is always a disagreeable object.It
becomes, therefore, a matter of true necessity so to arrange the doorway
as to admit of its being fitted with rectangular valves.Now, in determining the form of the aperture, we supposed the
jamb of the door to be of the utmost height required for entrance.The
extra height of the arch is unnecessary as an opening, the arch being
required for its strength only, not for its elevation.There is,
therefore, no reason why it should not be barred across by a horizontal
lintel, into which the valves may be fitted, and the triangular or
semicircular arched space above the lintel may then be permanently
closed, as we choose, either with bars, or glass, or stone.This is the form of all good doors, without exception, over the whole
world and in all ages, and no other can ever be invented.In the simplest doors the cross lintel is of wood only, and
glass or bars occupy the space above, a very frequent form in Venice.In more elaborate doors the cross lintel is of stone, and the filling
sometimes of brick, sometimes of stone, very often a grand single stone
being used to close the entire space: the space thus filled is called the
Tympanum.In large doors the cross lintel is too long to bear the great
incumbent weight of this stone filling without support; it is, therefore,
carried by a pier in the centre; and two valves are used, fitted to the
rectangular spaces on each side of the pier.In the most elaborate
examples of this condition, each of these secondary doorways has an arch
heading, a cross lintel, and a triangular filling or tympanum of its
own, all subordinated to the main arch above.When windows are large, and to be filled with glass, the sheet of glass,
however constructed, whether of large panes or small fragments, requires
the support of bars of some kind, either of wood, metal, or stone.Wood
is inapplicable on a large scale, owing to its destructibility; very fit
for door-valves, which can be easily refitted, and in which weight would
be an inconvenience, but very unfit for window-bars, which, if they
decayed, might let the whole window be blown in before their decay was
observed, and in which weight would be an advantage, as offering more
resistance to the wind.Iron is, however, fit for window-bars, and there seems no constructive
reason why we should not have iron traceries, as well as iron pillars,
iron churches, and iron steeples.But I have, in the "Seven Lamps,"
given reasons for not considering such structures as architecture at
all.The window-bars must, therefore, be of stone, and of stone only.V. The purpose of the window being always to let in as much light,
and command as much view, as possible, these bars of stone are to be made
as slender and as few as they can be, consistently with their due
strength.Let it be required to support the breadth of glass, _a_, _b_, Fig.The tendency of the glass sustaining any force, as of wind from without,
is to bend into an arch inwards, in the dotted line, and break in the
centre.It is to be supported, therefore, by the bar put in its centre,
_c_.But this central bar, _c_, may not be enough, and the spaces _a c_, _c
b_, may still need support.The next step will be to put two bars
instead of one, and divide the window into three spaces as at _d_.But this may still not be enough, and the window may need three bars.Now the greatest stress is always on the centre of the window.If the
three bars are equal in strength, as at _e_, the central bar is either
too slight for its work, or the lateral bars too thick for theirs.Therefore, we must slightly increase the thickness of the central bar,
and diminish that of the lateral ones, so as to obtain the arrangement
at _f h_.If the window enlarge farther, each of the spaces _f g_, _g
h_, is treated as the original space _a b_, and we have the groups of
bars _k_ and _l_.So that, whatever the shape of the window, whatever the direction and
number of the bars, there are to be central or main bars; second bars
subordinated to them; third bars subordinated to the second, and so on
to the number required.This is called the subordination of tracery, a
system delightful to the eye and mind, owing to its anatomical framing
and unity, and to its expression of the laws of good government in all
fragile and unstable things.All tracery, therefore, which is not
subordinated, is barbarous, in so far as this part of its structure is
concerned.The next question will be the direction of the bars.The reader
will understand at once, without any laborious proof, that a given area
of glass, supported by its edges, is stronger in its resistance to
violence when it is arranged in a long strip or band than in a square;
and that, therefore, glass is generally to be arranged, especially in
windows on a large scale, in oblong areas: and if the bars so dividing
it be placed horizontally, they will have less power of supporting
themselves, and will need to be thicker in consequence, than if placed
vertically.As far, therefore, as the form of the window permits, they
are to be vertical.But even when so placed, they cannot be trusted to support
themselves beyond a certain height, but will need cross bars to steady
them.Cross bars of stone are, therefore, to be introduced at necessary
intervals, not to divide the glass, but to support the upright stone
bars.The glass is always to be divided longitudinally as far as
possible, and the upright bars which divide it supported at proper
intervals.However high the window, it is almost impossible that it
should require more than two cross bars.It may sometimes happen that when tall windows are placed very
close to each other for the sake of more light, the masonry between them
may stand in need, or at least be the better of, some additional
support.The cross bars of the windows may then be thickened, in order
to bond the intermediate piers more strongly together, and if this
thickness appear ungainly, it may be modified by decoration.We have thus arrived at the idea of a vertical frame work of
subordinated bars, supported by cross bars at the necessary intervals,
and the only remaining question is the method of insertion into the
aperture.Whatever its form, if we merely let the ends of the bars into
the voussoirs of its heading, the least settlement of the masonry would
distort the arch, or push up some of its voussoirs, or break the window
bars, or push them aside.Evidently our object should be to connect the
window bars among themselves, so framing them together that they may
give the utmost possible degree of support to the whole window head in
case of any settlement.But we know how to do this already: our window
bars are nothing but small shafts.Capital them; throw small arches
across between the smaller bars, large arches over them between the
larger bars, one comprehensive arch over the whole, or else a horizontal
lintel, if the window have a flat head; and we have a complete system of
mutual support, independent of the aperture head, and yet assisting to
sustain it, if need be.But we want the spandrils of this arch system to
be themselves as light, and to let as much light through them, as
possible: and we know already how to pierce them (Chap.We pierce them with circles; and we have, if the circles are small and the
stonework strong, the traceries of Giotto and the Pisan school; if the
circles are as large as possible and the bars slender, those which I
have already figured and described as the only perfect traceries of the
Northern Gothic.[58] The varieties of their design arise partly from the
different size of window and consequent number of bars; partly from the
different heights of their pointed arches, as well as the various
positions of the window head in relation to the roof, rendering one or
another arrangement better for dividing the light, and partly from
aesthetic and expressional requirements, which, within certain limits,
may be allowed a very important influence: for the strength of the bars
is ordinarily so much greater than is absolutely necessary, that some
portion of it may be gracefully sacrificed to the attainment of variety
in the plans of tracery--a variety which, even within its severest
limits, is perfectly endless; more especially in the pointed arch, the
proportion of the tracery being in the round arch necessarily more
fixed.X. The circular window furnishes an exception to the common law, that
the bars shall be vertical through the greater part of their length: for
if they were so, they could neither have secure perpendicular footing,
nor secure heading, their thrust being perpendicular to the curve of the
voussoirs only in the centre of the window; therefore, a small circle,
like the axle of a wheel, is put into the centre of the window, large
enough to give footing to the necessary number of radiating bars; and
the bars are arranged as spokes, being all of course properly capitaled
and arch-headed.This is the best form of tracery for circular windows,
naturally enough called wheel windows when so filled.Now, I wish the reader especially to observe that we have arrived
at these forms of perfect Gothic tracery without the smallest reference
to any practice of any school, or to any law of authority whatever.They
are forms having essentially nothing whatever to do either with Goths or
Greeks.They are eternal forms, based on laws of gravity and cohesion;
and no better, nor any others so good, will ever be invented, so long as
the present laws of gravity and cohesion subsist.It does not at all follow that this group of forms owes its
origin to any such course of reasoning as that which has now led us to
it.On the contrary, there is not the smallest doubt that tracery began,
partly, in the grouping of windows together (subsequently enclosed
within a large arch[59]), and partly in the fantastic penetrations of a
single slab of stones under the arch, as the circle in Plate V. above.The perfect form seems to have been accidentally struck in passing from
experiment on the one side, to affectation on the other; and it was so
far from ever becoming systematised, that I am aware of no type of
tracery for which a _less_ decided preference is shown in the buildings
in which it exists.The early pierced traceries are multitudinous and
perfect in their kind,--the late Flamboyant, luxuriant in detail, and
lavish in quantity,--but the perfect forms exist in comparatively few
churches, generally in portions of the church only, and are always
connected, and that closely, either with the massy forms out of which
they have emerged, or with the enervated types into which they are
instantly to degenerate.Nor indeed are we to look upon them as in all points superior
to the more ancient examples.We have above conducted our reasoning
entirely on the supposition that a single aperture is given, which it is
the object to fill with glass, diminishing the power of the light as
little as possible.But there are many cases, as in triforium and
cloister lights, in which glazing is not required; in which, therefore,
the bars, if there be any, must have some more important function than
that of merely holding glass, and in which their actual use is to give
steadiness and _tone_, as it were, to the arches and walls above and
beside them; or to give the idea of protection to those who pass along
the triforium, and of seclusion to those who walk in the cloister.Much
thicker shafts, and more massy arches, may be properly employed in work
of this kind; and many groups of such tracery will be found resolvable
into true colonnades, with the arches in pairs, or in triple or
quadruple groups, and with small rosettes pierced above them for light.All this is just as _right_ in its place, as the glass tracery is in its
own function, and often much more grand.But the same indulgence is not
to be shown to the affectations which succeeded the developed forms.Of
these there are three principal conditions: the Flamboyant of France,
the Stump tracery of Germany, and the Perpendicular of England.Of these the first arose, by the most delicate and natural
transitions, out of the perfect school.It was an endeavor to introduce
more grace into its lines, and more change into its combinations; and
the aesthetic results are so beautiful, that for some time after the
right road had been left, the aberration was more to be admired than
regretted.The final conditions became fantastic and effeminate, but, in
the country where they had been invented, never lost their peculiar
grace until they were replaced by the Renaissance.The copies of the
school in England and Italy have all its faults and none of its
beauties; in France, whatever it lost in method or in majesty, it gained
in fantasy: literally Flamboyant, it breathed away its strength into
the air; but there is not more difference between the commonest doggrel
that ever broke prose into unintelligibility, and the burning mystery of
Coleridge, or spirituality of Elizabeth Barrett, than there is between
the dissolute dulness of English Flamboyant, and the flaming undulations
of the wreathed lines of delicate stone, that confuse themselves with
the clouds of every morning sky that brightens above the valley of the
Seine.The second group of traceries, the intersectional or German
group, may be considered as including the entire range of the absurd forms
which were invented in order to display dexterity in stone-cutting and
ingenuity in construction.They express the peculiar character of the
German mind, which cuts the frame of every truth joint from joint, in
order to prove the edge of its instruments; and, in all cases, prefers a
new or a strange thought to a good one, and a subtle thought to a useful
one.The point and value of the German tracery consists principally in
turning the features of good traceries upside down, and cutting them in
two where they are properly continuous.To destroy at once foundation
and membership, and suspend everything in the air, keeping out of sight,
as far as possible, the evidences of a beginning and the probabilities
of an end, are the main objects of German architecture, as of modern
German divinity.This school has, however, at least the merit of ingenuity.Not
so the English Perpendicular, though a very curious school also in _its_
way.In the course of the reasoning which led us to the determination of
the perfect Gothic tracery, we were induced successively to reject
certain methods of arrangement as weak, dangerous, or disagreeable.Collect all these together, and practise them at once, and you have the
English Perpendicular.You find, in the first place (Sec.), that your tracery bars
are to be subordinated, less to greater; so you take a group of, suppose,
eight, which you make all exactly equal, giving you nine equal spaces in
the window, as at A, Fig.You found, in the second place (Sec.), that there was no occasion for more than two cross bars; so you
take at least four or five (also represented at A, Fig.), also
carefully equalised, and set at equal spaces.You found, in the third
place (Sec.), that these bars were to be strengthened, in order to
support the main piers; you will therefore cut the ends off the uppermost,
and the fourth into three pieces (as also at A).In the fourth place, you
found (Sec.that you were never to run a vertical bar into the arch
head; so you run them all into it (as at B, Fig.); and this last
arrangement will be useful in two ways, for it will not only expose both
the bars and the archivolt to an apparent probability of every species
of dislocation at any moment, but it will provide you with two pleasing
interstices at the flanks, in the shape of carving-knives, _a_, _b_,
which, by throwing across the curves _c_, _d_, you may easily multiply
into four; and these, as you can put nothing into their sharp tops, will
afford you a more than usually rational excuse for a little bit of
Germanism, in filling them with arches upside down, _e_, _f_.You will
now have left at your disposal two and forty similar interstices, which,
for the sake of variety, you will proceed to fill with two and forty
similar arches: and, as you were told that the moment a bar received an
arch heading, it was to be treated as a shaft and capitalled, you will
take care to give your bars no capitals nor bases, but to run bars,
foliations and all, well into each other after the fashion of cast-iron,
as at C. You have still two triangular spaces occurring in an important
part of your window, _g g_, which, as they are very conspicuous, and you
cannot make them uglier than they are, you will do wisely to let
alone;--and you will now have the west window of the cathedral of
Winchester, a very perfect example of English Perpendicular.Nor do I
think that you can, on the whole, better the arrangement, unless,
perhaps, by adding buttresses to some of the bars, as is done in the
cathedral at Gloucester; these buttresses having the double advantage of
darkening the window when seen from within, and suggesting, when it is
seen from without, the idea of its being divided by two stout party
walls, with a heavy thrust against the glass.Thus far we have considered the plan of the tracery only:
we have lastly to note the conditions under which the glass is to be
attached to the bars; and the sections of the bars themselves.These bars we have seen, in the perfect form, are to become shafts; but,
supposing the object to be the admission of as much light as possible,
it is clear that the thickness of the bar ought to be chiefly in the
depth of the window, and that by increasing the depth of the bar we may
diminish its breadth: clearly, therefore, we should employ the double
group of shafts, _b_, of Fig.XIV., setting it edgeways in the window:
but as the glass would then come between the two shafts, we must add a
member into which it is to be fitted, as at _a_, Fig.XLVII., and
uniting these three members together in the simplest way, with a curved
instead of a sharp recess behind the shafts, we have the section _b_,
the perfect, but simplest type of the main tracery bars in good Gothic.In triforium and cloister tracery, which has no glass to hold, the
central member is omitted, and we have either the pure double shaft,
always the most graceful, or a single and more massy shaft, which is the
simpler and more usual form.Finally: there is an intermediate arrangement between the
glazed and the open tracery, that of the domestic traceries of Venice.Peculiar conditions, hereafter to be described, require the shafts of
these traceries to become the main vertical supports of the floors and
walls.Their thickness is therefore enormous; and yet free egress is
required between them (into balconies) which is obtained by doors in
their lattice glazing.To prevent the inconvenience and ugliness of
driving the hinges and fastenings of them into the shafts, and having
the play of the doors in the intervals, the entire glazing is thrown
behind the pillars, and attached to their abaci and bases with iron.It
is thus securely sustained by their massy bulk, and leaves their
symmetry and shade undisturbed.The depth at which the glass should be placed, in windows
without traceries, will generally be fixed by the forms of their
bevelling, the glass occupying the narrowest interval; but when its
position is not thus fixed, as in many London houses, it is to be
remembered that the deeper the glass is set (the wall being of given
thickness), the more light will enter, and the clearer the prospect
will be to a person sitting quietly in the centre of the room; on the
contrary, the farther out the glass is set, the more convenient the
window will be for a person rising and looking out of it.The one,
therefore, is an arrangement for the idle and curious, who care only
about what is going on upon the earth: the other for those who are
willing to remain at rest, so that they have free admission of the light
of Heaven.This might be noted as a curious expressional reason for the
necessity (of which no man of ordinary feeling would doubt for a moment)
of a deep recess in the window, on the outside, to all good or
architectural effect: still, as there is no reason why people should be
made idle by having it in their power to look out of window, and as the
slight increase of light or clearness of view in the centre of a room is
more than balanced by the loss of space, and the greater chill of the
nearer glass and outside air, we can, I fear, allege no other structural
reason for the picturesque external recess, than the expediency of a
certain degree of protection, for the glass, from the brightest glare of
sunshine, and heaviest rush of rain.FOOTNOTES:

  [58] "Seven Lamps," p.[59] On the north side of the nave of the cathedral of Lyons, there
    is an early French window, presenting one of the usual groups of
    foliated arches and circles, left, as it were, loose, without any
    enclosing curve.This remarkable window
    is associated with others of the common form.I. We have hitherto considered the aperture as merely pierced in the
thickness of the walls; and when its masonry is simple and the fillings
of the aperture are unimportant, it may well remain so.But when the
fillings are delicate and of value, as in the case of  glass,
finely wrought tracery, or sculpture, such as we shall often find
occupying the tympanum of doorways, some protection becomes necessary
against the run of the rain down the walls, and back by the bevel of the
aperture to the joints or surface of the fillings.The first and simplest mode of obtaining this is by channelling
the jambs and arch head; and this is the chief practical service of
aperture mouldings, which are otherwise entirely decorative.But as this
very decorative character renders them unfit to be made channels for
rain water, it is well to add some external roofing to the aperture,
which may protect it from the run of all the rain, except that which
necessarily beats into its own area.This protection, in its most usual
form, is a mere dripstone moulding carried over or round the head of the
aperture.But this is, in reality, only a contracted form of a true
_roof_, projecting from the wall over the aperture; and all protections
of apertures whatsoever are to be conceived as portions of small roofs,
attached to the wall behind; and supported by it, so long as their scale
admits of their being so with safety, and afterwards in such manner as
may be most expedient.The proper forms of these, and modes of their
support, are to be the subject of our final enquiry.Respecting their proper form we need not stay long in doubt.A
deep gable is evidently the best for throwing off rain; even a low gable
being better than a high arch.Flat roofs, therefore, may only be used
when the nature of the building renders the gable unsightly; as when
there is not room for it between the stories; or when the object is
rather shade than protection from rain, as often in verandahs and
balconies.But for general service the gable is the proper and natural
form, and may be taken as representative of the rest.Then this gable
may either project unsupported from the wall, _a_, Fig.XLVIII., or be
carried by brackets or spurs, _b_, or by walls or shafts, _c_, which
shafts or walls may themselves be, in windows, carried on a sill; and
this, in its turn, supported by brackets or spurs.We shall glance at
the applications of each of these forms in order.There is not much variety in the case of the first, _a_, Fig.In the Cumberland and border cottages the door is generally
protected by two pieces of slate arranged in a gable, giving the purest
possible type of the first form.In elaborate architecture such a
projection hardly ever occurs, and in large architecture cannot with
safety occur, without brackets; but by cutting away the greater part of
the projection, we shall arrive at the idea of a plain gabled cornice,
of which a perfect example will be found in Plate VII.With this first complete form we may associate the rude, single,
projecting, penthouse roof; imperfect, because either it must be level
and the water lodge lazily upon it, or throw off the drip upon the
persons entering.This is a most beautiful and natural type,
and is found in all good architecture, from the highest to the most
humble: it is a frequent form of cottage door, more especially when
carried on spurs, being of peculiarly easy construction in wood: as
applied to large architecture, it can evidently be built, in its boldest
and simplest form, either of wood only, or on a scale which will admit of
its sides being each a single slab of stone.If so large as to require
jointed masonry, the gabled sides will evidently require support, and an
arch must be thrown across under them, as in Fig.If we cut the projection gradually down, we arrive at the common Gothic
gable dripstone carried on small brackets, carved into bosses, heads, or
some other ornamental form; the sub-arch in such case being useless, is
removed or coincides with the arch head of the aperture.Substituting walls or pillars for the
brackets, we may carry the projection as far out as we choose, and form
the perfect porch, either of the cottage or village church, or of the
cathedral.As we enlarge the structure, however, certain modifications
of form become necessary, owing to the increased boldness of the
required supporting arch.For, as the lower end of the gabled roof and
of the arch cannot coincide, we have necessarily above the shafts one of
the two forms _a_ or _b_, in Fig.L., of which the latter is clearly the
best, requiring less masonry and shorter roofing; and when the arch
becomes so large as to cause a heavy lateral thrust, it may become
necessary to provide for its farther safety by pinnacles, _c_.This last is the perfect type of aperture protection.None other can
ever be invented so good.It is that once employed by Giotto in the
cathedral of Florence, and torn down by the proveditore, Benedetto
Uguccione, to erect a Renaissance front instead; and another such has
been destroyed, not long since, in Venice, the porch of the church of
St.Apollinare, also to put up some Renaissance upholstery: for
Renaissance, as if it were not nuisance enough in the mere fact of its
own existence, appears invariably as a beast of prey, and founds itself
on the ruin of all that is best and noblest.Many such porches, however,
happily still exist in Italy, and are among its principal glories.When porches of this kind, carried by walls, are placed close
together, as in cases where there are many and large entrances to a
cathedral front, they would, in their general form, leave deep and
uncomfortable intervals, in which damp would lodge and grass grow; and
there would be a painful feeling in approaching the door in the midst of
a crowd, as if some of them might miss the real doors, and be driven
into the intervals, and embayed there.Clearly it will be a natural and
right expedient, in such cases, to open the walls of the porch wider, so
that they may correspond in <DW72>, or nearly so, with the bevel of the
doorway, and either meet each other in the intervals, or have the said
intervals closed up with an intermediate wall, so that nobody may get
embayed in them.The porches will thus be united, and form one range of
great open gulphs or caverns, ready to receive all comers, and direct
the current of the crowd into the narrower entrances.As the lateral
thrust of the arches is now met by each other, the pinnacles, if there
were any, must be removed, and waterspouts placed between each arch to
discharge the double drainage of the gables.This is the form of all the
noble northern porches, without exception, best represented by that of
Rheims.Contracted conditions of the pinnacle porch are beautifully
used in the doors of the cathedral of Florence; and the entire
arrangement, in its most perfect form, as adapted to window protection and
decoration, is applied by Giotto with inconceivable exquisiteness in the
windows of the campanile; those of the cathedral itself being all of the
same type.Various singular and delightful conditions of it are applied
in Italian domestic architecture (in the Broletto of Monza very
quaintly), being associated with balconies for speaking to the people,
and passing into pulpits.In the north we glaze the sides of such
projections, and they become bow-windows, the shape of roofing being
then nearly immaterial and very fantastic, often a conical cap.All
these conditions of window protection, being for real service, are
endlessly delightful (and I believe the beauty of the balcony, protected
by an open canopy supported by light shafts, never yet to have been
properly worked out).But the Renaissance architects destroyed all of
them, and introduced the magnificent and witty Roman invention of a
model of a Greek pediment, with its cornices of monstrous thickness,
bracketed up above the window.The horizontal cornice of the pediment is
thus useless, and of course, therefore, retained; the protection to the
head of the window being constructed on the principle of a hat with its
crown sewn up.But the deep and dark triangular cavity thus obtained
affords farther opportunity for putting ornament out of sight, of which
the Renaissance architects are not slow to avail themselves.A more rational condition is the complete pediment with a couple of
shafts, or pilasters, carried on a bracketed sill; and the windows of
this kind, which have been well designed, are perhaps the best things
which the Renaissance schools have produced: those of Whitehall are, in
their way, exceedingly beautiful; and those of the Palazzo Ricardi at
Florence, in their simplicity and sublimity, are scarcely unworthy of
their reputed designer, Michael Angelo.I. The reader has now some knowledge of every feature of all possible
architecture.Whatever the nature of the building which may be submitted
to his criticism, if it be an edifice at all, if it be anything else
than a mere heap of stones like a pyramid or breakwater, or than a large
stone hewn into shape, like an obelisk, it will be instantly and easily
resolvable into some of the parts which we have been hitherto
considering: its pinnacles will separate themselves into their small
shafts and roofs; its supporting members into shafts and arches, or
walls penetrated by apertures of various shape, and supported by various
kinds of buttresses.Respecting each of these several features I am
certain that the reader feels himself prepared, by understanding their
plain function, to form something like a reasonable and definite
judgment, whether they be good or bad; and this right judgment of parts
will, in most cases, lead him to just reverence or condemnation of the
whole.The various modes in which these parts are capable of
combination, and the merits of buildings of different form and expression,
are evidently not reducible into lists, nor to be estimated by general
laws.The nobility of each building depends on its special fitness for its
own purposes; and these purposes vary with every climate, every soil, and
every national custom: nay, there were never, probably, two edifices
erected in which some accidental difference of condition did not require
some difference of plan or of structure; so that, respecting plan and
distribution of parts, I do not hope to collect any universal law of
right; but there are a few points necessary to be noticed respecting the
means by which height is attained in buildings of various plans, and
the expediency and methods of superimposition of one story or tier of
architecture above another.For, in the preceding inquiry, I have always supposed either
that a single shaft would reach to the top of the building, or that the
farther height required might be added in plain wall above the heads of
the arches; whereas it may often be rather expedient to complete the
entire lower series of arches, or finish the lower wall, with a bold
string course or cornice, and build another series of shafts, or another
wall, on the top of it.This superimposition is seen in its simplest form in the interior
shafts of a Greek temple; and it has been largely used in nearly all
countries where buildings have been meant for real service.Outcry has
often been raised against it, but the thing is so sternly necessary that
it has always forced itself into acceptance; and it would, therefore, be
merely losing time to refute the arguments of those who have attempted
its disparagement.Thus far, however, they have reason on their side,
that if a building can be kept in one grand mass, without sacrificing
either its visible or real adaptation to its objects, it is not well to
divide it into stories until it has reached proportions too large to be
justly measured by the eye.It ought then to be divided in order to mark
its bulk; and decorative divisions are often possible, which rather
increase than destroy the expression of general unity.V. Superimposition, wisely practised, is of two kinds, directly
contrary to each other, of weight on lightness, and of lightness on
weight; while the superimposition of weight on weight, or lightness on
lightness, is nearly always wrong.Weight on lightness: I do not say weight on _weakness_.The
superimposition of the human body on its limbs I call weight on
lightness: the superimposition of the branches on a tree trunk I call
lightness on weight: in both cases the support is fully adequate to the
work, the form of support being regulated by the differences of
requirement.Nothing in architecture is half so painful as the apparent
want of sufficient support when the weight above is visibly passive:
for all buildings are not passive; some seem to rise by their own
strength, or float by their own buoyancy; a dome requires no visibility
of support, one fancies it supported by the air.But passive
architecture without help for its passiveness is unendurable.In a
lately built house, No.86, in Oxford Street, three huge stone pillars
in the second story are carried apparently by the edges of three sheets
of plate glass in the first.I hardly know anything to match the
painfulness of this and some other of our shop structures, in which the
iron-work is concealed; nor, even when it is apparent, can the eye ever
feel satisfied of their security, when built, as at present, with fifty
or sixty feet of wall above a rod of iron not the width of this page.The proper forms of this superimposition of weight on lightness
have arisen, for the most part, from the necessity or desirableness, in
many situations, of elevating the inhabited portions of buildings
considerably above the ground level, especially those exposed to damp or
inundation, and the consequent abandonment of the ground story as
unserviceable, or else the surrender of it to public purposes.Thus, in
many market and town houses, the ground story is left open as a general
place of sheltered resort, and the enclosed apartments raised on
pillars.In almost all warm countries the luxury, almost the necessity,
of arcades to protect the passengers from the sun, and the desirableness
of large space in the rooms above, lead to the same construction.Throughout the Venetian islet group, the houses seem to have been thus,
in the first instance, universally built, all the older palaces
appearing to have had the rez de chaussee perfectly open, the upper
parts of the palace being sustained on magnificent arches, and the
smaller houses sustained in the same manner on wooden piers, still
retained in many of the cortiles, and exhibited characteristically
throughout the main street of Murano.As ground became more valuable and
house-room more scarce, these ground-floors were enclosed with wall
veils between the original shafts, and so remain; but the type of the
structure of the entire city is given in the Ducal Palace.To this kind of superimposition we owe the most picturesque
street effects throughout the world, and the most graceful, as well as
the most grotesque, buildings, from the many-shafted fantasy of the
Alhambra (a building as beautiful in disposition as it is base in
ornamentation) to the four-legged stolidity of the Swiss Chalet:[60] nor
these only, but great part of the effect of our cathedrals, in which,
necessarily, the close triforium and clerestory walls are superimposed
on the nave piers; perhaps with most majesty where with greatest
simplicity, as in the old basilican types, and the noble cathedral of
Pisa.In order to the delightfulness and security of all such
arrangements, this law must be observed:--that in proportion to the
height of wall above them, the shafts are to be short.You may take your
given height of wall, and turn any quantity of that wall into shaft that
you like; but you must not turn it all into tall shafts, and then put
more wall above.Thus, having a house five stories high, you may turn
the lower story into shafts, and leave the four stories in wall; or the
two lower stories into shafts, and leave three in wall; but, whatever
you add to the shaft, you must take from the wall.Then also, of course,
the shorter the shaft the thicker will be its _proportionate_, if not
its actual, diameter.In the Ducal Palace of Venice the shortest shafts
are always the thickest.The second kind of superimposition, lightness on weight, is, in
its most necessary use, of stories of houses one upon another, where, of
course, wall veil is required in the lower ones, and has to support wall
veil above, aided by as much of shaft structure as is attainable within
the given limits.The greatest, if not the only, merit of the Roman and
Renaissance Venetian architects is their graceful management of this
kind of superimposition; sometimes of complete courses of external
arches and shafts one above the other; sometimes of apertures with
intermediate cornices at the levels of the floors, and large shafts from
top to bottom of the building; always observing that the upper stories
shall be at once lighter and richer than the lower ones.The entire
value of such buildings depends upon the perfect and easy expression of
the relative strength of the stories, and the unity obtained by the
varieties of their proportions, while yet the fact of superimposition
and separation by floors is frankly told.X. In churches and other buildings in which there is no separation
by floors, another kind of pure shaft superimposition is often used, in
order to enable the builder to avail himself of short and slender
shafts.It has been noted that these are often easily attainable, and of
precious materials, when shafts large enough and strong enough to do the
work at once, could not be obtained except at unjustifiable expense, and
of coarse stone.The architect has then no choice but to arrange his
work in successive stories; either frankly completing the arch work and
cornice of each, and beginning a new story above it, which is the
honester and nobler way, or else tying the stories together by
supplementary shafts from floor to roof,--the general practice of the
Northern Gothic, and one which, unless most gracefully managed, gives
the look of a scaffolding, with cross-poles tied to its uprights, to the
whole clerestory wall.The best method is that which avoids all chance
of the upright shafts being supposed continuous, by increasing their
number and changing their places in the upper stories, so that the whole
work branches from the ground like a tree.This is the superimposition
of the Byzantine and the Pisan Romanesque; the most beautiful examples
of it being, I think, the Southern portico of St.Mark's, the church of
S. Giovanni at Pistoja, and the apse of the cathedral of Pisa.In
Renaissance work the two principles are equally distinct, though the
shafts are (I think) always one above the other.The reader may see one
of the best examples of the separately superimposed story in Whitehall
(and another far inferior in St.Paul's), and by turning himself round
at Whitehall may compare with it the system of connecting shafts in the
Treasury; though this is a singularly bad example, the window cornices
of the first floor being like shelves in a cupboard, and cutting the
mass of the building in two, in spite of the pillars.But this superimposition of lightness on weight is still more
distinctly the system of many buildings of the kind which I have above
called Architecture of Position, that is to say, architecture of which
the greater part is intended merely to keep something in a peculiar
position; as in light-houses, and many towers and belfries.The subject
of spire and tower architecture, however, is so interesting and
extensive, that I have thoughts of writing a detached essay upon it,
and, at all events, cannot enter upon it here: but this much is enough
for the reader to note for our present purpose, that, although many
towers do in reality stand on piers or shafts, as the central towers of
cathedrals, yet the expression of all of them, and the real structure of
the best and strongest, are the elevation of gradually diminishing
weight on massy or even solid foundation.Nevertheless, since the tower
is in its origin a building for strength of defence, and faithfulness of
watch, rather than splendor of aspect, its true expression is of just so
much diminution of weight upwards as may be necessary to its fully
balanced strength, not a jot more.There must be no light-headedness in
your noble tower: impregnable foundation, wrathful crest, with the vizor
down, and the dark vigilance seen through the clefts of it; not the
filigree crown or embroidered cap.No towers are so grand as the
square-browed ones, with massy cornices and rent battlements: next to
these come the fantastic towers, with their various forms of steep roof;
the best, not the cone, but the plain gable thrown very high; last of
all in my mind (of good towers), those with spires or crowns, though
these, of course, are fittest for ecclesiastical purposes, and capable
of the richest ornament.The paltry four or eight pinnacled things we
call towers in England (as in York Minster), are mere confectioner's
Gothic, and not worth classing.But, in all of them, this I believe to be a point of chief
necessity,--that they shall seem to stand, and shall verily stand, in
their own strength; not by help of buttresses nor artful balancings on
this side and on that.Your noble tower must need no help, must be
sustained by no crutches, must give place to no suspicion of
decrepitude.Its office may be to withstand war, look forth for tidings,
or to point to heaven: but it must have in its own walls the strength to
do this; it is to be itself a bulwark, not to be sustained by other
bulwarks; to rise and look forth, "the tower of Lebanon that looketh
toward Damascus," like a stern sentinel, not like a child held up in its
nurse's arms.A tower may, indeed, have a kind of buttress, a
projection, or subordinate tower at each of its angles; but these are to
its main body like the satellites to a shaft, joined with its strength,
and associated in its uprightness, part of the tower itself: exactly in
the proportion in which they lose their massive unity with its body and
assume the form of true buttress walls set on its angles, the tower
loses its dignity.These two characters, then, are common to all noble towers,
however otherwise different in purpose or feature,--the first, that they
rise from massy foundation to lighter summits, frowning with battlements
perhaps, but yet evidently more pierced and thinner in wall than
beneath, and, in most ecclesiastical examples, divided into rich open
work: the second, that whatever the form of the tower, it shall not
appear to stand by help of buttresses.It follows from the first
condition, as indeed it would have followed from ordinary aesthetic
requirements, that we shall have continual variation in the arrangements
of the stories, and the larger number of apertures towards the top,--a
condition exquisitely carried out in the old Lombardic towers, in which,
however small they may be, the number of apertures is always regularly
increased towards the summit; generally one window in the lowest
stories, two in the second, then three, five, and six; often, also,
one, two, four, and six, with beautiful symmetries of placing, not at
present to our purpose.We may sufficiently exemplify the general laws
of tower building by placing side by side, drawn to the same scale, a
mediaeval tower, in which most of them are simply and unaffectedly
observed, and one of our own modern towers, in which every one of them
is violated, in small space, convenient for comparison.Mark's at Venice, not a very
perfect example, for its top is Renaissance, but as good Renaissance as
there is in Venice; and it is fit for our present purpose, because it owes
none of its effect to ornament.It is built as simply as it well can be to
answer its purpose: no buttresses; no external features whatever, except
some huts at the base, and the loggia, afterwards built, which, on
purpose, I have not drawn; one bold square mass of brickwork; double
walls, with an ascending inclined plane between them, with apertures as
small as possible, and these only in necessary places, giving just the
light required for ascending the stair or <DW72>, not a ray more; and the
weight of the whole relieved only by the double pilasters on the sides,
sustaining small arches at the top of the mass, each decorated with the
scallop or cockle shell, presently to be noticed as frequent in
Renaissance ornament, and here, for once, thoroughly well applied.Then,
when the necessary height is reached, the belfry is left open, as in the
ordinary Romanesque campanile, only the shafts more slender, but severe
and simple, and the whole crowned by as much spire as the tower would
carry, to render it more serviceable as a landmark.The arrangement is
repeated in numberless campaniles throughout Italy.The one beside it is one of those of the lately built college at
Edinburgh.I have not taken it as worse than many others (just as I have
not taken the St.Mark's tower as better than many others); but it
happens to compress our British system of tower building into small
space.The Venetian tower rises 350 feet,[62] and has no buttresses,
though built of brick; the British tower rises 121 feet, and is built
of stone, but is supposed to be incapable of standing without two huge
buttresses on each angle.Mark's tower has a high sloping roof,
but carries it simply, requiring no pinnacles at its angles; the British
tower has no visible roof, but has four pinnacles for mere ornament.The
Venetian tower has its lightest part at the top, and is massy at the
base; the British tower has its lightest part at the base, and shuts up
its windows into a mere arrowslit at the top.What the tower was built
for at all must therefore, it seems to me, remain a mystery to every
beholder; for surely no studious inhabitant of its upper chambers will
be conceived to be pursuing his employments by the light of the single
chink on each side; and, had it been intended for a belfry, the sound of
its bells would have been as effectually prevented from getting out as
the light from getting in.In connexion with the subject of towers and of superimposition,
one other feature, not conveniently to be omitted from our
house-building, requires a moment's notice,--the staircase.In modern houses it can hardly be considered an architectural feature,
and is nearly always an ugly one, from its being apparently without
support.And here I may not unfitly note the important distinction,
which perhaps ought to have been dwelt upon in some places before now,
between the _marvellous_ and the _perilous_ in apparent construction.There are many edifices which are awful or admirable in their height,
and lightness, and boldness of form, respecting which, nevertheless, we
have no fear that they should fall.Many a mighty dome and aerial aisle
and arch may seem to stand, as I said, by miracle, but by steadfast
miracle notwithstanding; there is no fear that the miracle should cease.We have a sense of inherent power in them, or, at all events, of
concealed and mysterious provision for their safety.But in leaning
towers, as of Pisa or Bologna, and in much minor architecture, passive
architecture, of modern times, we feel that there is but a chance
between the building and destruction; that there is no miraculous life
in it, which animates it into security, but an obstinate, perhaps vain,
resistance to immediate danger.The appearance of this is often as
strong in small things as in large; in the sounding-boards of pulpits,
for instance, when sustained by a single pillar behind them, so that one
is in dread, during the whole sermon, of the preacher being crushed if a
single nail should give way; and again, the modern geometrical
unsupported staircase.There is great disadvantage, also, in the
arrangement of this latter, when room is of value; and excessive
ungracefulness in its awkward divisions of the passage walls, or
windows.In mediaeval architecture, where there was need of room, the
staircase was spiral, and enclosed generally in an exterior tower, which
added infinitely to the picturesque effect of the building; nor was the
stair itself steeper nor less commodious than the ordinary compressed
straight staircase of a modern dwelling-house.Many of the richest
towers of domestic architecture owe their origin to this arrangement.In
Italy the staircase is often in the open air, surrounding the interior
court of the house, and giving access to its various galleries or
loggias: in this case it is almost always supported by bold shafts and
arches, and forms a most interesting additional feature of the cortile,
but presents no peculiarity of construction requiring our present
examination.We may here, therefore, close our inquiries into the subject of
construction; nor must the reader be dissatisfied with the simplicity or
apparent barrenness of their present results.He will find, when he
begins to apply them, that they are of more value than they now seem;
but I have studiously avoided letting myself be drawn into any intricate
question, because I wished to ask from the reader only so much attention
as it seemed that even the most indifferent would not be unwilling to
pay to a subject which is hourly becoming of greater practical interest.Evidently it would have been altogether beside the purpose of this essay
to have entered deeply into the abstract science, or closely into the
mechanical detail, of construction: both have been illustrated by
writers far more capable of doing so than I, and may be studied at the
reader's discretion; all that has been here endeavored was the leading
him to appeal to something like definite principle, and refer to the
easily intelligible laws of convenience and necessity, whenever he found
his judgment likely to be overborne by authority on the one hand, or
dazzled by novelty on the other.If he has time to do more, and to
follow out in all their brilliancy the mechanical inventions of the
great engineers and architects of the day, I, in some sort, envy him,
but must part company with him: for my way lies not along the viaduct,
but down the quiet valley which its arches cross, nor through the
tunnel, but up the hill-side which its cavern darkens, to see what gifts
Nature will give us, and with what imagery she will fill our thoughts,
that the stones we have ranged in rude order may now be touched with
life; nor lose for ever, in their hewn nakedness, the voices they had of
old, when the valley streamlet eddied round them in palpitating light,
and the winds of the hill-side shook over them the shadows of the fern.FOOTNOTES:

  [60] I have spent much of my life among the Alps; but I never pass,
    without some feeling of new surprise, the Chalet, standing on its
    four pegs (each topped with a flat stone), balanced in the fury of
    Alpine winds.It is not, perhaps, generally known that the chief use
    of the arrangement is not so much to raise the building above the
    snow, as to get a draught of wind beneath it, which may prevent the
    drift from rising against its sides.[61] Appendix 20, "Shafts of the Ducal Palace."[62] I have taken Professor Willis's estimate; there being discrepancy
    among various statements.I did not take the trouble to measure the
    height myself, the building being one which does not come within the
    range of our future inquiries; and its exact dimensions, even here,
    are of no importance as respects the question at issue.THE MATERIAL OF ORNAMENT.I. We enter now on the second division of our subject.We have no
more to do with heavy stones and hard lines; we are going to be happy:
to look round in the world and discover (in a serious manner always,
however, and under a sense of responsibility) what we like best in it,
and to enjoy the same at our leisure: to gather it, examine it, fasten
all we can of it into imperishable forms, and put it where we may see it
for ever.There are, therefore, three steps in the process: first, to find
out in a grave manner what we like best; secondly, to put as much of
this as we can (which is little enough) into form; thirdly, to put this
formed abstraction into a proper place.And we have now, therefore, to make these three inquiries in succession:
first, what we like, or what is the right material of ornament; then how
we are to present it, or its right treatment; then, where we are to put
it, or its right place.I think I can answer that first inquiry in this
Chapter, the second inquiry in the next Chapter, and the third I shall
answer in a more diffusive manner, by taking up in succession the
several parts of architecture above distinguished, and rapidly noting
the kind of ornament fittest for each.XIV., that all noble ornamentation
was the expression of man's delight in God's work.This implied that
there was an _ig_noble ornamentation, which was the expression of man's
delight in his _own_.There is such a school, chiefly degraded classic
and Renaissance, in which the ornament is composed of imitations of
tilings made by man.I think, before inquiring what we like best of
God's work, we had better get rid of all this imitation of man's, and be
quite sure we do not like _that_.We shall rapidly glance, then, at the material of decoration
hence derived.And now I cannot, as I before have done respecting
construction, _convince_ the reader of one thing being wrong, and
another right.I have confessed as much again and again; I am now only
to make appeal to him, and cross-question him, whether he really does
like things or not.If he likes the ornament on the base of the column
of the Place Vendome, composed of Wellington boots and laced frock
coats, I cannot help it; I can only say I differ from him, and don't
like it.And if, therefore, I speak dictatorially, and say this is base,
or degraded, or ugly, I mean, only that I believe men of the longest
experience in the matter would either think it so, or would be prevented
from thinking it so only by some morbid condition of their minds; and I
believe that the reader, if he examine himself candidly, will usually
agree in my statements.V. The subjects of ornament found in man's work may properly fall
into four heads: 1.Instruments of art, agriculture, and war; armor, and
dress; 2.The custom of raising trophies on pillars, and of dedicating arms in
temples, appears to have first suggested the idea of employing them as
the subjects of sculptural ornament: thenceforward, this abuse has been
chiefly characteristic of classical architecture, whether true or
Renaissance.Armor is a noble thing in its proper service and
subordination to the body; so is an animal's hide on its back; but a
heap of cast skins, or of shed armor, is alike unworthy of all regard or
imitation.We owe much true sublimity, and more of delightful
picturesqueness, to the introduction of armor both in painting and
sculpture: in poetry it is better still,--Homer's undressed Achilles is
less grand than his crested and shielded Achilles, though Phidias would
rather have had him naked; in all mediaeval painting, arms, like all
other parts of costume, are treated with exquisite care and delight; in
the designs of Leonardo, Raffaelle, and Perugino, the armor sometimes
becomes almost too conspicuous from the rich and endless invention
bestowed upon it; while Titian and Rubens seek in its flash what the
Milanese and Perugian sought in its form, sometimes subordinating
heroism to the light of the steel, while the great designers wearied
themselves in its elaborate fancy.But all this labor was given to the living, not the dead armor; to the
shell with its animal in it, not the cast shell of the beach; and even
so, it was introduced more sparingly by the good sculptors than the good
painters; for the former felt, and with justice, that the painter had
the power of conquering the over prominence of costume by the expression
and color of the countenance, and that by the darkness of the eye, and
glow of the cheek, he could always conquer the gloom and the flash of
the mail; but they could hardly, by any boldness or energy of the marble
features, conquer the forwardness and conspicuousness of the sharp
armorial forms.Their armed figures were therefore almost always
subordinate, their principal figures draped or naked, and their choice
of subject was much influenced by this feeling of necessity.But the
Renaissance sculptors displayed the love of a Camilla for the mere crest
and plume.Paltry and false alike in every feeling of their narrowed
minds, they attached themselves, not only to costume without the person,
but to the pettiest details of the costume itself.They could not
describe Achilles, but they could describe his shield; a shield like
those of dedicated spoil, without a handle, never to be waved in the
face of war.And then we have helmets and lances, banners and swords,
sometimes with men to hold them, sometimes without; but always chiselled
with a tailor-like love of the chasing or the embroidery,--show helmets
of the stage, no Vulcan work on them, no heavy hammer strokes, no Etna
fire in the metal of them, nothing but pasteboard crests and high
feathers.And these, cast together in disorderly heaps, or grinning
vacantly over keystones, form one of the leading decorations of
Renaissance architecture, and that one of the best; for helmets and
lances, however loosely laid, are better than violins, and pipes, and
books of music, which were another of the Palladian and Sansovinian
sources of ornament.Supported by ancient authority, the abuse soon
became a matter of pride, and since it was easy to copy a heap of cast
clothes, but difficult to manage an arranged design of human figures,
the indolence of architects came to the aid of their affectation, until
by the moderns we find the practice carried out to its most interesting
results, and, as above noted, a large pair of boots occupying the
principal place in the bas-reliefs on the base of the Colonne Vendome.A less offensive, because singularly grotesque, example of the
abuse at its height, occurs in the Hotel des Invalides, where the dormer
windows are suits of armor down to the bottom of the corselet, crowned
by the helmet, and with the window in the middle of the breast.Instruments of agriculture and the arts are of less frequent occurrence,
except in hieroglyphics, and other work, where they are not employed as
ornaments, but represented for the sake of accurate knowledge, or as
symbols.Wherever they have purpose of this kind, they are of course
perfectly right; but they are then part of the building's conversation,
not conducive to its beauty.The French have managed, with great
dexterity, the representation of the machinery for the elevation of
their Luxor obelisk, now sculptured on its base.I have already spoken of the error of introducing
drapery, as such, for ornament, in the "Seven Lamps."I may here note a
curious instance of the abuse in the church of the Jesuiti at Venice
(Renaissance).On first entering you suppose that the church, being in a
poor quarter of the city, has been somewhat meanly decorated by heavy
green and white curtains of an ordinary upholsterer's pattern: on
looking closer, they are discovered to be of marble, with the green
pattern inlaid.Another remarkable instance is in a piece of not
altogether unworthy architecture at Paris (Rue Rivoli), where the
columns are supposed to be decorated with images of handkerchiefs tied
in a stout knot round the middle of them.This shrewd invention bids
fair to become a new order.Multitudes of massy curtains and various
upholstery, more or less in imitation of that of the drawing-room, are
carved and gilt, in wood or stone, about the altars and other theatrical
portions of Romanist churches; but from these coarse and senseless
vulgarities we may well turn, in all haste, to note, with respect as
well as regret, one of the errors of the great school of Niccolo
Pisano,--an error so full of feeling as to be sometimes all but
redeemed, and altogether forgiven,--the sculpture, namely, of curtains
around the recumbent statues upon tombs, curtains which angels are
represented as withdrawing, to gaze upon the faces of those who are at
rest.For some time the idea was simply and slightly expressed, and
though there was always a painfulness in finding the shafts of stone,
which were felt to be the real supporters of the canopy, represented as
of yielding drapery, yet the beauty of the angelic figures, and the
tenderness of the thought, disarmed all animadversion.But the scholars
of the Pisani, as usual, caricatured when they were unable to invent;
and the quiet curtained canopy became a huge marble tent, with a pole in
the centre of it.Thus vulgarised, the idea itself soon disappeared, to
make room for urns, torches, and weepers, and the other modern
paraphernalia of the churchyard.I have allowed this kind of subject to form a
separate head, owing to the importance of rostra in Roman decoration,
and to the continual occurrence of naval subjects in modern monumental
bas-relief.Fergusson says, somewhat doubtfully, that he perceives a
"_kind_ of beauty" in a ship: I say, without any manner of doubt, that a
ship is one of the loveliest things man ever made, and one of the
noblest; nor do I know any lines, out of divine work, so lovely as those
of the head of a ship, or even as the sweep of the timbers of a small
boat, not a race boat, a mere floating chisel, but a broad, strong, sea
boat, able to breast a wave and break it: and yet, with all this beauty,
ships cannot be made subjects of sculpture.No one pauses in particular
delight beneath the pediments of the Admiralty; nor does scenery of
shipping ever become prominent in bas-relief without destroying it:
witness the base of the Nelson pillar.It may be, and must be sometimes,
introduced in severe subordination to the figure subject, but just
enough to indicate the scene; sketched in the lightest lines on the
background; never with any attempt at realisation, never with any
equality to the force of the figures, unless the whole purpose of the
subject be picturesque.I shall explain this exception presently, in
speaking of imitative architecture.There is one piece of a ship's fittings, however, which may
be thought to have obtained acceptance as a constant element of
architectural ornament,--the cable: it is not, however, the cable
itself, but its abstract form, a group of twisted lines (which a cable
only exhibits in common with many natural objects), which is indeed
beautiful as an ornament.Make the resemblance complete, give to the
stone the threads and character of the cable, and you may, perhaps,
regard the sculpture with curiosity, but never more with admiration.Consider the effect of the base of the statue of King William IV.The erroneous use of armor, or dress, or
instruments, or shipping, as decorative subject, is almost exclusively
confined to bad architecture--Roman or Renaissance.But the false use of
architecture itself, as an ornament of architecture, is conspicuous even
in the mediaeval work of the best times, and is a grievous fault in some
of its noblest examples.It is, therefore, of great importance to note exactly at what point this
abuse begins, and in what it consists.In all bas-relief, architecture may be introduced as an
explanation of the scene in which the figures act; but with more or less
prominence in the _inverse ratio of the importance of the figures_.The metaphysical reason of this is, that where the figures are of great
value and beauty, the mind is supposed to be engaged wholly with them;
and it is an impertinence to disturb its contemplation of them by any
minor features whatever.As the figures become of less value, and are
regarded with less intensity, accessory subjects may be introduced, such
as the thoughts may have leisure for.Thus, if the figures be as large as life, and complete statues, it is
gross vulgarity to carve a temple above them, or distribute them over
sculptured rocks, or lead them up steps into pyramids: I need hardly
instance Canova's works,[63] and the Dutch pulpit groups, with
fishermen, boats, and nets, in the midst of church naves.If the figures be in bas-relief, though as large as life, the scene may
be explained by lightly traced outlines: this is admirably done in the
Ninevite marbles.If the figures be in bas-relief, or even alto-relievo, but less than
life, and if their purpose is rather to enrich a space and produce
picturesque shadows, than to draw the thoughts entirely to themselves,
the scenery in which they act may become prominent.The most exquisite
examples of this treatment are the gates of Ghiberti.What would that
Madonna of the Annunciation be, without the little shrine into which she
shrinks back?But all mediaeval work is full of delightful examples of
the same kind of treatment: the gates of hell and of paradise are
important pieces, both of explanation and effect, in all early
representations of the last judgment, or of the descent into Hades.Peter, and the crushing flat of the devil under his own
door, when it is beaten in, would hardly be understood without the
respective gate-ways above.The best of all the later capitals of the
Ducal Palace of Venice depends for great part of its value on the
richness of a small campanile, which is pointed to proudly by a small
emperor in a turned-up hat, who, the legend informs us, is "Numa
Pompilio, imperador, edifichador di tempi e chiese."Shipping may be introduced, or rich fancy of vestments, crowns,
and ornaments, exactly on the same conditions as architecture; and if
the reader will look back to my definition of the picturesque in the
"Seven Lamps," he will see why I said, above, that they might only be
prominent when the purpose of the subject was partly picturesque; that
is to say, when the mind is intended to derive part of its enjoyment
from the parasitical qualities and accidents of the thing, not from the
heart of the thing itself.And thus, while we must regret the flapping sails in the death of Nelson
in Trafalgar Square, we may yet most heartily enjoy the sculpture of a
storm in one of the bas-reliefs of the tomb of St.Pietro Martire in the
church of St.Eustorgio at Milan, where the grouping of the figures is
most fancifully complicated by the undercut cordage of the vessel.In all these instances, however, observe that the permission
to represent the human work as an ornament, is conditional on its being
necessary to the representation of a scene, or explanation of an action.On no terms whatever could any such subject be independently admissible.Observe, therefore, the use of manufacture as ornament is--

  1.With heroic figure sculpture, not admissible at all.With picturesque figure sculpture, admissible in the degree of its
       picturesqueness.Without figure sculpture, not admissible at all.So also in painting: Michael Angelo, in the Sistine Chapel, would not
have willingly painted a dress of figured damask or of watered satin;
his was heroic painting, not admitting accessories.Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Vandyck, would be very sorry to
part with their figured stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry, observe,
exactly in the degree of their picturesque feeling.Should not _we_ also
be sorry to have Bishop Ambrose without his vest, in that picture of the
National Gallery?But I think Vandyck would not have liked, on the other hand, the vest
without the bishop.I much doubt if Titian or Veronese would have
enjoyed going into Waterloo House, and making studies of dresses upon
the counter.So, therefore, finally, neither architecture nor any other human
work is admissible as an ornament, except in subordination to figure
subject.And this law is grossly and painfully violated by those curious
examples of Gothic, both early and late, in the north, (but late, I
think, exclusively, in Italy,) in which the minor features of the
architecture were composed of _small models_ of the larger: examples
which led the way to a series of abuses materially affecting the life,
strength, and nobleness of the Northern Gothic,--abuses which no
Ninevite, nor Egyptian, nor Greek, nor Byzantine, nor Italian of the
earlier ages would have endured for an instant, and which strike me with
renewed surprise whenever I pass beneath a portal of thirteenth century
Northern Gothic, associated as they are with manifestations of exquisite
feeling and power in other directions.The porches of Bourges, Amiens,
Notre Dame of Paris, and Notre Dame of Dijon, may be noted as
conspicuous in error: small models of feudal towers with diminutive
windows and battlements, of cathedral spires with scaly pinnacles, mixed
with temple pediments and nondescript edifices of every kind, are
crowded together over the recess of the niche into a confused fool's cap
for the saint below.Italian Gothic is almost entirely free from the
taint of this barbarism until the Renaissance period, when it becomes
rampant in the cathedral of Como and Certosa of Pavia; and at Venice we
find the Renaissance churches decorated with models of fortifications
like those in the Repository at Woolwich, or inlaid with mock arcades in
pseudo-perspective, copied from gardeners' paintings at the ends of
conservatories.I conclude, then, with the reader's leave, that all ornament
is base which takes for its subject human work, that it is utterly
base,--painful to every rightly-toned mind, without perhaps immediate
sense of the reason, but for a reason palpable enough when we _do_ think
of it.For to carve our own work, and set it up for admiration, is a
miserable self-complacency, a contentment in our own wretched doings,
when we might have been looking at God's doings.And all noble ornament
is the exact reverse of this.It is the expression of man's delight in
God's work.For observe, the function of ornament is to make you happy.Not in thinking of what you have done
yourself; not in your own pride, not your own birth; not in your own
being, or your own will, but in looking at God; watching what He does,
what He is; and obeying His law, and yielding yourself to His will.You are to be made happy by ornaments; therefore they must be the
expression of all this.Not copies of your own handiwork; not boastings
of your own grandeur; not heraldries; not king's arms, nor any
creature's arms, but God's arm, seen in His work.Not manifestation of
your delight in your own laws, or your own liberties, or your own
inventions; but in divine laws, constant, daily, common laws;--not
Composite laws, nor Doric laws, nor laws of the five orders, but of the
Ten Commandments.Then the proper material of ornament will be whatever God has
created; and its proper treatment, that which seems in accordance with
or symbolical of His laws.And, for material, we shall therefore have,
first, the abstract lines which are most frequent in nature; and then,
from lower to higher, the whole range of systematised inorganic and
organic forms.We shall rapidly glance in order at their kinds; and,
however absurd the elemental division of inorganic matter by the
ancients may seem to the modern chemist, it is one so grand and simple
for arrangements of external appearances, that I shall here follow it;
noticing first, after abstract lines, the imitable forms of the four
elements, of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, and then those of animal
organisms.It may be convenient to the reader to have the order stated
in a clear succession at first, thus:--

   1.Forms of Fire (Flames and Rays).It may be objected that clouds are a form of moisture, not of air.They
are, however, a perfect expression of aerial states and currents, and
may sufficiently well stand for the element they move in.And I have put
vegetation apparently somewhat out of its place, owing to its vast
importance as a means of decoration, and its constant association with
birds and men.I have not with lines named also shades
and colors, for this evident reason, that there are no such things as
abstract shadows, irrespective of the forms which exhibit them, and
distinguished in their own nature from each other; and that the
arrangement of shadows, in greater or less quantity, or in certain
harmonical successions, is an affair of treatment, not of selection.And
when we use abstract colors, we are in fact using a part of nature
herself,--using a quality of her light, correspondent with that of the
air, to carry sound; and the arrangement of color in harmonious masses
is again a matter of treatment, not selection.Yet even in this separate
art of coloring, as referred to architecture, it is very notable that
the best tints are always those of natural stones.These can hardly be
wrong; I think I never yet saw an offensive introduction of the natural
colors of marble and precious stones, unless in small mosaics, and in
one or two glaring instances of the resolute determination to produce
something ugly at any cost.On the other hand, I have most assuredly
never yet seen a painted building, ancient or modern, which seemed to me
quite right.Our first constituents of ornament will therefore be abstract
lines, that is to say, the most frequent contours of natural objects,
transferred to architectural forms when it is not right or possible to
render such forms distinctly imitative.For instance, the line or curve
of the edge of a leaf may be accurately given to the edge of a stone,
without rendering the stone in the least _like_ a leaf, or suggestive of
a leaf; and this the more fully, because the lines of nature are alike
in all her works; simpler or richer in combination, but the same in
character; and when they are taken out of their combinations it is
impossible to say from which of her works they have been borrowed, their
universal property being that of ever-varying curvature in the most
subtle and subdued transitions, with peculiar expressions of motion,
elasticity, or dependence, which I have already insisted upon at some
length in the chapters on typical beauty in "Modern Painters."But, that
the reader may here be able to compare them for himself as deduced from
different sources, I have drawn, as accurately as I can, on the opposite
plate, some ten or eleven lines from natural forms of very different
substances and scale: the first, _a b_, is in the original, I think, the
most beautiful simple curve I have ever seen in my life; it is a curve
about three quarters of a mile long, formed by the surface of a small
glacier of the second order, on a spur of the Aiguille de Blaitiere
(Chamouni).I have merely outlined the crags on the right of it, to show
their sympathy and united action with the curve of the glacier, which is
of course entirely dependent on their opposition to its descent;
softened, however, into unity by the snow, which rarely melts on this
high glacier surface.The line _d c_ is some mile and a half or two miles long; it is part of
the flank of the chain of the Dent d'Oche above the lake of Geneva, one
or two of the lines of the higher and more distant ranges being given in
combination with it._h_ is a line about four feet long, a branch of spruce fir.I have taken
this tree because it is commonly supposed to be stiff and ungraceful;
its outer sprays are, however, more noble in their sweep than almost any
that I know: but this fragment is seen at great disadvantage, because
placed upside down, in order that the reader may compare its curvatures
with _c d_, _e g_, and _i k_, which are all mountain lines; _e g_, about
five hundred feet of the southern edge of the Matterhorn; _i k_, the
entire <DW72> of the Aiguille Bouchard, from its summit into the valley
of Chamouni, a line some three miles long; _l m_ is the line of the side
of a willow leaf traced by laying the leaf on the paper; _n o_, one of
the innumerable groups of curves at the lip of a paper Nautilus; _p_, a
spiral, traced on the paper round a Serpula; _q r_, the leaf of the
Alisma Plantago with its interior ribs, real size; _s t_, the side of a
bay-leaf; _u w_, of a salvia leaf; and it is to be carefully noted that
these last curves, being never intended by nature to be seen singly, are
more heavy and less agreeable than any of the others which would be seen
as independent lines.But all agree in their character of changeful
curvature, the mountain and glacier lines only excelling the rest in
delicacy and richness of transition.Why lines of this kind are beautiful, I endeavored to show in
the "Modern Painters;" but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned
here,--that almost all these lines are expressive of action of _force_
of some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support.In
leafage they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among
the most beautiful of them are described by bodies variously in motion,
or subjected to force; as by projectiles in the air, by the particles of
water in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their
satellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered
instead of its relation to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in
the water or air, by clouds in various action upon the wind, by sails in
the curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of other
objects moving or bearing force.In the Alisma leaf, _q r_, the lines
through its body, which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different
expansions of its fibres, and are, I think, exactly the same as those
which would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake of the
shape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its
point.Circular curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of
limitation or support; that is to say, curves of perfect rest.The
cylindrical curve round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together;
while the _ascent_ of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the
curve of the horizon and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.:
and though the reader might imagine that the circular orbit of any
moving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion,
he should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not
by the motion, but by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not
of the energy of the body, but of its being forbidden to leave the
centre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully
impressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the
centre of the circle.Hence the peculiar fitness of the circular curve as a sign of rest, and
security of support, in arches; while the other curves, belonging
especially to action, are to be used in the more active architectural
features--the hand and foot (the capital and base), and in all minor
ornaments; more freely in proportion to their independence of structural
conditions.We need not, however, hope to be able to imitate, in general
work, any of the subtly combined curvatures of nature's highest
designing: on the contrary, their extreme refinement renders them unfit
for coarse service or material.Lines which are lovely in the pearly
film of the Nautilus shell, are lost in the grey roughness of stone; and
those which are sublime in the blue of far away hills, are weak in the
substance of incumbent marble.Of all the graceful lines assembled on
Plate VII., we shall do well to be content with two of the simplest.We
shall take one mountain line (_e g_) and one leaf line (_u w_), or
rather fragments of them, for we shall perhaps not want them all.I will
mark off from _u w_ the little bit _x y_, and from _e g_ the piece _e
f_; both which appear to me likely to be serviceable: and if hereafter
we need the help of any abstract lines, we will see what we can do with
these only.It may be asked why I do not
say rocks or mountains?Simply, because the nobility of these depends,
first, on their scale, and, secondly, on accident.Their scale cannot be
represented, nor their accident systematised.No sculptor can in the
least imitate the peculiar character of accidental fracture: he can obey
or exhibit the laws of nature, but he cannot copy the felicity of her
fancies, nor follow the steps of her fury.The very glory of a mountain
is in the revolutions which raised it into power, and the forces which
are striking it into ruin.But we want no cold and careful imitation of
catastrophe; no calculated mockery of convulsion; no delicate
recommendation of ruin.We are to follow the labor of Nature, but not
her disturbance; to imitate what she has deliberately ordained,[64] not
what she has violently suffered, or strangely permitted.The only uses,
therefore, of rock form which are wise in the architect, are its actual
introduction (by leaving untouched such blocks as are meant for rough
service), and that noble use of the general examples of mountain
structure of which I have often heretofore spoken.Imitations of rock
form have, for the most part, been confined to periods of degraded
feeling and to architectural toys or pieces of dramatic effect,--the
Calvaries and holy sepulchres of Romanism, or the grottoes and fountains
of English gardens.They were, however, not unfrequent in mediaeval
bas-reliefs; very curiously and elaborately treated by Ghiberti on the
doors of Florence, and in religious sculpture necessarily introduced
wherever the life of the anchorite was to be expressed.They were rarely
introduced as of ornamental character, but for particular service and
expression; we shall see an interesting example in the Ducal Palace at
Venice.But against crystalline form, which is the completely
systematised natural structure of the earth, none of these objections
hold good, and, accordingly, it is an endless element of decoration,
where higher conditions of structure cannot be represented.The
four-sided pyramid, perhaps the most frequent of all natural crystals,
is called in architecture a dogtooth; its use is quite limitless, and
always beautiful: the cube and rhomb are almost equally frequent in
chequers and dentils: and all mouldings of the middle Gothic are little
more than representations of the canaliculated crystals of the beryl,
and such other minerals:

Sec.I do not suppose a single hint was ever actually
taken from mineral form; not even by the Arabs in their stalactite
pendants and vaults: all that I mean to allege is, that beautiful
ornament, wherever found, or however invented, is always either an
intentional or unintentional copy of some constant natural form; and
that in this particular instance, the pleasure we have in these
geometrical figures of our own invention, is dependent for all its
acuteness on the natural tendency impressed on us by our Creator to love
the forms into which the earth He gave us to tread, and out of which He
formed our bodies, knit itself as it was separated from the deep.The reasons which prevent rocks from being used for ornament repress
still more forcibly the portraiture of the sea.Yet the constant
necessity of introducing some representation of water in order to
explain the scene of events, or as a sacred symbol, has forced the
sculptors of all ages to the invention of some type or letter for it, if
not an actual imitation.We find every degree of conventionalism or of
naturalism in these types, the earlier being, for the most part,
thoughtful symbols; the latter, awkward attempts at portraiture.[65] The
most conventional of all types is the Egyptian zigzag, preserved in the
astronomical sign of Aquarius; but every nation, with any capacities of
thought, has given, in some of its work, the same great definition of
open water, as "an undulatory thing with fish in it."I say _open_
water, because inland nations have a totally different conception of the
element.Imagine for an instant the different feelings of an husbandman
whose hut is built by the Rhine or the Po, and who sees, day by day,
the same giddy succession of silent power, the same opaque, thick,
whirling, irresistible labyrinth of rushing lines and twisted eddies,
coiling themselves into serpentine race by the reedy banks, in omne
volubilis aevum,--and the image of the sea in the mind of the fisher upon
the rocks of Ithaca, or by the Straits of Sicily, who sees how, day by
day, the morning winds come coursing to the shore, every breath of them
with a green wave rearing before it; clear, crisp, ringing, merry-minded
waves, that fall over and over each other, laughing like children as
they near the beach, and at last clash themselves all into dust of
crystal over the dazzling sweeps of sand.Fancy the difference of the
image of water in those two minds, and then compare the sculpture of the
coiling eddies of the Tigris and its reedy branches in those slabs of
Nineveh, with the crested curls of the Greek sea on the coins of
Camerina or Tarentum.But both agree in the undulatory lines, either of
the currents or the surface, and in the introduction of fish as
explanatory of the meaning of those lines (so also the Egyptians in
their frescoes, with most elaborate realisation of the fish).There is a
very curious instance on a Greek mirror in the British Museum,
representing Orion on the Sea; and multitudes of examples with dolphins
on the Greek vases: the type is preserved without alteration in mediaeval
painting and sculpture.The sea in that Greek mirror (at least 400
B.C.), in the mosaics of Torcello and St.Frediano at Lucca, on the gate of the fortress of St.Michael's Mount in
Normandy, on the Bayeux tapestry, and on the capitals of the Ducal
Palace at Venice (under Arion on his Dolphin), is represented in a
manner absolutely identical.Giotto, in the frescoes of Avignon, has,
with his usual strong feeling for naturalism, given the best example I
remember, in painting, of the unity of the conventional system with
direct imitation, and that both in sea and river; giving in pure blue
color the coiling whirlpool of the stream, and the curled crest of the
breaker.But in all early sculptural examples, both imitation and
decorative effect are subordinate to easily understood symbolical
language; the undulatory lines are often valuable as an enrichment of
surface, but are rarely of any studied gracefulness.One of the best
examples I know of their expressive arrangement is around some figures
in a spandril at Bourges, representing figures sinking in deep sea (the
deluge): the waved lines yield beneath the bodies and wildly lave the
edge of the moulding, two birds, as if to mark the reverse of all order
of nature, lowest of all sunk in the depth of them.In later times of
debasement, water began to be represented with its waves, foam, etc., as
on the Vendramin tomb at Venice, above cited; but even there, without
any definite ornamental purpose, the sculptor meant partly to explain a
story, partly to display dexterity of chiselling, but not to produce
beautiful forms pleasant to the eye.The imitation is vapid and joyless,
and it has often been matter of surprise to me that sculptors, so fond
of exhibiting their skill, should have suffered this imitation to fall
so short, and remain so cold,--should not have taken more pains to curl
the waves clearly, to edge them sharply, and to express, by drill-holes
or other artifices, the character of foam.I think in one of the Antwerp
churches something of this kind is done in wood, but in general it is
rare.Forms of Fire (Flames and Rays).If neither the sea nor
the rock can be imagined, still less the devouring fire.It has been
symbolised by radiation both in painting and sculpture, for the most
part in the latter very unsuccessfully.It was suggested to me, not long
ago,[66] that zigzag decorations of Norman architects were typical of
light springing from the half-set orb of the sun; the resemblance to the
ordinary sun type is indeed remarkable, but I believe accidental.I
shall give you, in my large plates, two curious instances of radiation
in brick ornament above arches, but I think these also without any very
luminous intention.The imitations of fire in the torches of Cupids and
genii, and burning in tops of urns, which attest and represent the
mephitic inspirations of the seventeenth century in most London
churches, and in monuments all over civilised Europe, together with the
gilded rays of Romanist altars, may be left to such mercy as the reader
is inclined to show them.Hardly more manageable than flames,
and of no ornamental use, their majesty being in scale and color, and
inimitable in marble.They are lightly traced in much of the cinque
cento sculpture; very boldly and grandly in the strange Last Judgment in
the porch of St.Maclou at Rouen, described in the "Seven Lamps."But
the most elaborate imitations are altogether of recent date, arranged in
concretions like flattened sacks, forty or fifty feet above the altars
of continental churches, mixed with the gilded truncheons intended for
sunbeams above alluded to.I place these lowest in the scale (after inorganic
forms) as being moulds or coats of organism; not themselves organic.The
sense of this, and of their being mere emptiness and deserted houses,
must always prevent them, however beautiful in their lines, from being
largely used in ornamentation.It is better to take the line and leave
the shell.One form, indeed, that of the cockle, has been in all ages
used as the decoration of half domes, which were named conchas from
their shell form: and I believe the wrinkled lip of the cockle, so used,
to have been the origin, in some parts of Europe at least, of the
exuberant foliation of the round arch.The scallop also is a pretty
radiant form, and mingles well with other symbols when it is needed.The
crab is always as delightful as a grotesque, for here we suppose the
beast inside the shell; and he sustains his part in a lively manner
among the other signs of the zodiac, with the scorpion; or scattered
upon sculptured shores, as beside the Bronze Boar of Florence.We shall
find him in a basket at Venice, at the base of one of the Piazzetta
shafts.These, as beautiful in their forms as they are
familiar to our sight, while their interest is increased by their
symbolic meaning, are of great value as material of ornament.Love of
the picturesque has generally induced a choice of some supple form with
scaly body and lashing tail, but the simplest fish form is largely
employed in mediaeval work.We shall find the plain oval body and sharp
head of the Thunny constantly at Venice; and the fish used in the
expression of sea-water, or water generally, are always plain bodied
creatures in the best mediaeval sculpture.The Greek type of the dolphin,
however, sometimes but slightly exaggerated from the real outline of the
Delphinus Delphis,[67] is one of the most picturesque of animal forms;
and the action of its slow revolving plunge is admirably caught upon the
surface sea represented in Greek vases.The forms of the serpent and
lizard exhibit almost every element of beauty and horror in strange
combination; the horror, which in an imitation is felt only as a
pleasurable excitement, has rendered them favorite subjects in all
periods of art; and the unity of both lizard and serpent in the ideal
dragon, the most picturesque and powerful of all animal forms, and of
peculiar symbolical interest to the Christian mind, is perhaps the
principal of all the materials of mediaeval picturesque sculpture.By the
best sculptors it is always used with this symbolic meaning, by the
cinque cento sculptors as an ornament merely.The best and most natural
representations of mere viper or snake are to be found interlaced among
their confused groups of meaningless objects.The real power and horror
of the snake-head has, however, been rarely reached.I shall give one
example from Verona of the twelfth century.Other less powerful reptile forms are not unfrequent.Small frogs,
lizards, and snails almost always enliven the foregrounds and leafage of
good sculpture.The tortoise is less usually employed in groups.Beetles
are chiefly mystic and colossal.Various insects, like everything else
in the world, occur in cinque cento work; grasshoppers most frequently.We shall see on the Ducal Palace at Venice an interesting use of the
bee.I arrange these under a
separate head; because, while the forms of leafage belong to all
architecture, and ought to be employed in it always, those of the branch
and stem belong to a peculiar imitative and luxuriant architecture, and
are only applicable at times.Pagan sculptors seem to have perceived
little beauty in the stems of trees; they were little else than timber to
them; and they preferred the rigid and monstrous triglyph, or the fluted
column, to a broken bough or gnarled trunk.But with Christian knowledge
came a peculiar regard for the forms of vegetation, from the root
upwards.The actual representation of the entire trees required in many
scripture subjects,--as in the most frequent of Old Testament subjects,
the Fall; and again in the Drunkenness of Noah, the Garden Agony, and
many others, familiarised the sculptors of bas-relief to the beauty of
forms before unknown; while the symbolical name given to Christ by the
Prophets, "the Branch," and the frequent expressions referring to this
image throughout every scriptural description of conversion, gave an
especial interest to the Christian mind to this portion of vegetative
structure.For some time, nevertheless, the sculpture of trees was
confined to bas-relief; but it at last affected even the treatment of
the main shafts in Lombard Gothic buildings,--as in the western facade
of Genoa, where two of the shafts are represented as gnarled trunks: and
as bas-relief itself became more boldly introduced, so did tree
sculpture, until we find the writhed and knotted stems of the vine and
fig used for angle shafts on the Doge's Palace, and entire oaks and
appletrees forming, roots and all, the principal decorative sculptures
of the Scala tombs at Verona.It was then discovered to be more easy to
carve branches than leaves and, much helped by the frequent employment
in later Gothic of the "Tree of Jesse," for traceries and other
purposes, the system reached full developement in a perfect thicket of
twigs, which form the richest portion of the decoration of the porches
of Beauvais.It had now been carried to its richest extreme: men
wearied of it and abandoned it, and like all other natural and beautiful
things, it was ostracised by the mob of Renaissance architects.But it
is interesting to observe how the human mind, in its acceptance of this
feature of ornament, proceeded from the ground, and followed, as it
were, the natural growth of the tree.It began with the rude and solid
trunk, as at Genoa; then the branches shot out, and became loaded
leaves; autumn came, the leaves were shed, and the eye was directed to
the extremities of the delicate branches;--the Renaissance frosts came,
and all perished.It is necessary to consider
these as separated from the stems; not only, as above noted, because
their separate use marks another school of architecture, but because
they are the only organic structures which are capable of being so
treated, and intended to be so, without strong effort of imagination.To
pull animals to pieces, and use their paws for feet of furniture, or
their heads for terminations of rods and shafts, is _usually_ the
characteristic of feelingless schools; the greatest men like their
animals whole.The head may, indeed, be so managed as to look emergent
from the stone, rather than fastened to it; and wherever there is
throughout the architecture any expression of sternness or severity
(severity in its literal sense, as in Romans, XI.22), such divisions of
the living form may be permitted; still, you cannot cut an animal to
pieces as you can gather a flower or a leaf.These were intended for our
gathering, and for our constant delight: wherever men exist in a
perfectly civilised and healthy state, they have vegetation around them;
wherever their state approaches that of innocence or perfectness, it
approaches that of Paradise,--it is a dressing of garden.And,
therefore, where nothing else can be used for ornament, vegetation may;
vegetation in any form, however fragmentary, however abstracted.A
single leaf laid upon the angle of a stone, or the mere form or
frame-work of the leaf drawn upon it, or the mere shadow and ghost of
the leaf,--the hollow "foil" cut out of it,--possesses a charm which
nothing else can replace; a charm not exciting, nor demanding laborious
thought or sympathy, but perfectly simple, peaceful, and satisfying.The full recognition of leaf forms, as the general source of
subordinate decoration, is one of the chief characteristics of Christian
architecture; but the two _roots_ of leaf ornament are the Greek
acanthus, and the Egyptian lotus.[68] The dry land and the river thus
each contributed their part; and all the florid capitals of the richest
Northern Gothic on the one hand, and the arrowy lines of the severe
Lombardic capitals on the other, are founded on these two gifts of the
dust of Greece and the waves of the Nile.The leaf which is, I believe,
called the Persepolitan water-leaf, is to be associated with the lotus
flower and stem, as the origin of our noblest types of simple capital;
and it is to be noted that the florid leaves of the dry land are used
most by the Northern architects, while the water leaves are gathered for
their ornaments by the parched builders of the Desert.Fruit is, for the most part, more valuable in color than
form; nothing is more beautiful as a subject of sculpture on a tree; but,
gathered and put in baskets, it is quite possible to have too much of
it.We shall find it so used very dextrously on the Ducal Palace of
Venice, there with a meaning which rendered it right necessary; but the
Renaissance architects address themselves to spectators who care for
nothing but feasting, and suppose that clusters of pears and pineapples
are visions of which their imagination can never weary, and above which
it will never care to rise.I am no advocate for image worship, as I
believe the reader will elsewhere sufficiently find; but I am very sure
that the Protestantism of London would have found itself quite as secure
in a cathedral decorated with statues of good men, as in one hung round
with bunches of ribston pippins.The perfect and simple grace of bird form, in
general, has rendered it a favorite subject with early sculptors, and
with those schools which loved form more than action; but the difficulty
of expressing action, where the muscular markings are concealed, has
limited the use of it in later art.Half the ornament, at least, in
Byzantine architecture, and a third of that of Lombardic, is composed of
birds, either pecking at fruit or flowers, or standing on either side of
a flower or vase, or alone, as generally the symbolical peacock.But how
much of our general sense of grace or power of motion, of serenity,
peacefulness, and spirituality, we owe to these creatures, it is
impossible to conceive; their wings supplying us with almost the only
means of representation of spiritual motion which we possess, and with
an ornamental form of which the eye is never weary, however
meaninglessly or endlessly repeated; whether in utter isolation, or
associated with the bodies of the lizard, the horse, the lion, or the
man.The heads of the birds of prey are always beautiful, and used as
the richest ornaments in all ages.Of quadrupeds the horse has received
an elevation into the primal rank of sculptural subject, owing to his
association with men.The full value of other quadruped forms has hardly
been perceived, or worked for, in late sculpture; and the want of
science is more felt in these subjects than in any other branches of
early work.The greatest richness of quadruped ornament is found in the
hunting sculpture of the Lombards; but rudely treated (the most noble
examples of treatment being the lions of Egypt, the Ninevite bulls, and
the mediaeval griffins).Quadrupeds of course form the noblest subjects
of ornament next to the human form; this latter, the chief subject of
sculpture, being sometimes the end of architecture rather than its
decoration.We have thus completed the list of the materials of architectural
decoration, and the reader may be assured that no effort has ever been
successful to draw elements of beauty from any other sources than
these.It was contrary to the
religion of the Arab to introduce any animal form into his ornament; but
although all the radiance of color, all the refinements of proportion,
and all the intricacies of geometrical design were open to him, he could
not produce any noble work without an _abstraction_ of the forms of
leafage, to be used in his capitals, and made the ground plan of his
chased ornament.But I have above noted that coloring is an entirely
distinct and independent art; and in the "Seven Lamps" we saw that this
art had most power when practised in arrangements of simple geometrical
form: the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage in coloring, and he
had all the noble elements of constructive and proportional beauty at
his command: he might not imitate the sea-shell, but he could build the
dome.The imitation of radiance by the variegated voussoir, the
expression of the sweep of the desert by the barred red lines upon the
wall, the starred inshedding of light through his vaulted roof, and all
the endless fantasy of abstract line,[69] were still in the power of his
ardent and fantastic spirit.Much he achieved; and yet in the effort of
his overtaxed invention, restrained from its proper food, he made his
architecture a glittering vacillation of undisciplined enchantment, and
left the lustre of its edifices to wither like a startling dream, whose
beauty we may indeed feel, and whose instruction we may receive, but
must smile at its inconsistency, and mourn over its evanescence.FOOTNOTES:

  [63] The admiration of Canova I hold to be one of the most deadly
    symptoms in the civilisation of the upper classes in the present
    century.[64] Thus above, I adduced for the architect's imitation the
    appointed stories and beds of the Matterhorn, not its irregular
    forms of crag or fissure.[65] Appendix 21, "Ancient Representations of Water."[66] By the friend to whom I owe Appendix 21.[67] One is glad to hear from Cuvier, that though dolphins in general
    are "les plus carnassiers, et proportion gardee avec leur taille,
    les plus cruels de l'ordre;" yet that in the Delphinus Delphis,
    "tout l'organisation de son cerveau annonce _qu'il ne doit pas etre
    depourvu de la docilite_ qu'ils (les anciens) lui attribuaient."The tamarisk
    appears afterwards to have given the idea of a subdivision of leaf
    more pure and quaint than that of the acanthus.Of late our
    botanists have discovered, in the "Victoria regia" (supposing its
    blossom reversed), another strangely beautiful type of what we may
    perhaps hereafter find it convenient to call _Lily_ capitals.[69] Appendix 22, "Arabian Ornamentation."TREATMENT OF ORNAMENT.I. We now know where we are to look for subjects of decoration.The
next question is, as the reader must remember, how to treat or express
these subjects.There are evidently two branches of treatment: the first being the
expression, or rendering to the eye and mind, of the thing itself; and
the second, the arrangement of the thing so expressed: both of these
being quite distinct from the placing of the ornament in proper parts of
the building.For instance, suppose we take a vine-leaf for our subject.The first question is, how to cut the vine-leaf?Shall we cut its ribs
and notches on the edge, or only its general outline?Then,
how to arrange the vine-leaves when we have them; whether symmetrically,
or at random; or unsymmetrically, yet within certain limits?Then, whether the vine-leaves so arranged
are to be set on the capital of a pillar or on its shaft, I call a
question of place.So, then, the questions of mere treatment are twofold, how to
express, and how to arrange.And expression is to the mind or the sight.Therefore, the inquiry becomes really threefold:--

  1.How ornament is to be expressed with reference to the mind.How ornament is to be arranged with reference to the sight.How ornament is to be arranged with reference to both.How is ornament to be treated with reference to the mind?If, to produce a good or beautiful ornament, it were only necessary to
produce a perfect piece of sculpture, and if a well cut group of flowers
or animals were indeed an ornament wherever it might be placed, the work
of the architect would be comparatively easy.Sculpture and architecture
would become separate arts; and the architect would order so many pieces
of such subject and size as he needed, without troubling himself with
any questions but those of disposition and proportion._No perfect piece either of painting or sculpture is an
architectural ornament at all_, except in that vague sense in which any
beautiful thing is said to ornament the place it is in.Thus we say that
pictures ornament a room; but we should not thank an architect who told
us that his design, to be complete, required a Titian to be put in one
corner of it, and a Velasquez in the other; and it is just as
unreasonable to call perfect sculpture, niched in, or encrusted on a
building, a portion of the ornament of that building, as it would be to
hang pictures by the way of ornament on the outside of it.It is very
possible that the sculptured work may be harmoniously associated with
the building, or the building executed with reference to it; but in this
latter case the architecture is subordinate to the sculpture, as in the
Medicean chapel, and I believe also in the Parthenon.And so far from
the perfection of the work conducing to its ornamental purpose, we may
say, with entire security, that its perfection, in some degree, unfits
it for its purpose, and that no absolutely complete sculpture can be
decoratively right.We have a familiar instance in the flower-work of
St.Paul's, which is probably, in the abstract, as perfect flower
sculpture as could be produced at the time; and which is just as
rational an ornament of the building as so many valuable Van Huysums,
framed and glazed and hung up over each window.The especial condition of true ornament is, that it be beautiful
in its place, and nowhere else, and that it aid the effect of every
portion of the building over which it has influence; that it does not,
by its richness, make other parts bald, or, by its delicacy, make other
parts coarse.Every one of its qualities has reference to its place and
use: _and it is fitted for its service by what would be faults and
deficiencies if it had no especial duty_.Ornament, the servant, is
often formal, where sculpture, the master, would have been free; the
servant is often silent where the master would have been eloquent; or
hurried, where the master would have been serene.V. How far this subordination is in different situations to be
expressed, or how far it may be surrendered, and ornament, the servant,
be permitted to have independent will; and by what means the
subordination is best to be expressed when it is required, are by far
the most difficult questions I have ever tried to work out respecting
any branch of art; for, in many of the examples to which I look as
authoritative in their majesty of effect, it is almost impossible to say
whether the abstraction or imperfection of the sculpture was owing to
the choice, or the incapacity of the workman; and, if to the latter, how
far the result of fortunate incapacity can be imitated by prudent
self-restraint.The reader, I think, will understand this at once by
considering the effect of the illuminations of an old missal.In their
bold rejection of all principles of perspective, light and shade, and
drawing, they are infinitely more ornamental to the page, owing to the
vivid opposition of their bright colors and quaint lines, than if they
had been drawn by Da Vinci himself: and so the Arena chapel is far more
brightly _decorated_ by the archaic frescoes of Giotti, than the Stanze
of the Vatican are by those of Raffaelle.But how far it is possible to
recur to such archaicism, or to make up for it by any voluntary
abandonment of power, I cannot as yet venture in any wise to determine.So, on the other hand, in many instances of finished work in
which I find most to regret or to reprobate, I can hardly distinguish what
is erroneous in principle from what is vulgar in execution.For instance,
in most Romanesque churches of Italy, the porches are guarded by
gigantic animals, lions or griffins, of admirable severity of design;
yet, in many cases, of so rude workmanship, that it can hardly be
determined how much of this severity was intentional,--how much
involuntary: in the cathedral of Genoa two modern lions have, in
imitation of this ancient custom, been placed on the steps of its west
front; and the Italian sculptor, thinking himself a marvellous great man
because he knew what lions were really like, has copied them, in the
menagerie, with great success, and produced two hairy and well-whiskered
beasts, as like to real lions as he could possibly cut them.One wishes
them back in the menagerie for his pains; but it is impossible to say
how far the offence of their presence is owing to the mere stupidity and
vulgarity of the sculpture, and how far we might have been delighted
with a realisation, carried to nearly the same length by Ghiberti or
Michael Angelo.(I say _nearly_, because neither Ghiberti nor Michael
Angelo would ever have attempted, or permitted, entire realisation, even
in independent sculpture.)In spite of these embarrassments, however, some few certainties
may be marked in the treatment of past architecture, and secure
conclusions deduced for future practice.There is first, for instance,
the assuredly intended and resolute abstraction of the Ninevite and
Egyptian sculptors.The men who cut those granite lions in the Egyptian
room of the British Museum, and who carved the calm faces of those
Ninevite kings, knew much more, both of lions and kings, than they chose
to express.Then there is the Greek system, in which the human sculpture
is perfect, the architecture and animal sculpture is subordinate to it,
and the architectural ornament severely subordinated to this again, so
as to be composed of little more than abstract lines: and, finally,
there is the peculiarly mediaeval system, in which the inferior details
are carried to as great or greater imitative perfection as the higher
sculpture; and the subordination is chiefly effected by symmetries of
arrangement, and quaintnesses of treatment, respecting which it is
difficult to say how far they resulted from intention, and how far from
incapacity.Now of these systems, the Ninevite and Egyptian are altogether
opposed to modern habits of thought and action; they are sculptures
evidently executed under absolute authorities, physical and mental, such
as cannot at present exist.The Greek system presupposes the possession
of a Phidias; it is ridiculous to talk of building in the Greek manner;
you may build a Greek shell or box, such as the Greek intended to
contain sculpture, but you have not the sculpture to put in it.Find
your Phidias first, and your new Phidias will very soon settle all your
architectural difficulties in very unexpected ways indeed; but until you
find him, do not think yourselves architects while you go on copying
those poor subordinations, and secondary and tertiary orders of
ornament, which the Greek put on the shell of his sculpture.Some of
them, beads, and dentils, and such like, are as good as they can be for
their work, and you may use them for subordinate work still; but they
are nothing to be proud of, especially when you did not invent them: and
others of them are mistakes and impertinences in the Greek himself, such
as his so-called honeysuckle ornaments and others, in which there is a
starched and dull suggestion of vegetable form, and yet no real
resemblance nor life, for the conditions of them result from his own
conceit of himself, and ignorance of the physical sciences, and want of
relish for common nature, and vain fancy that he could improve
everything he touched, and that he honored it by taking it into his
service: by freedom from which conceits the true Christian architecture
is distinguished--not by points to its arches.There remains, therefore, only the mediaeval system, in which
I think, generally, more completion is permitted (though this often
because more was possible) in the inferior than in the higher portions
of ornamental subject.Leaves, and birds, and lizards are realised, or
nearly so; men and quadrupeds formalised.For observe, the smaller and
inferior subject remains subordinate, however richly finished; but the
human sculpture can only be subordinate by being imperfect.The
realisation is, however, in all cases, dangerous except under most
skilful management, and the abstraction, if true and noble, is almost
always more delightful.[70]

[Illustration: Plate VIII.PALAZZO DEI BADOARI PARTECIPAZZI.]X. What, then, is noble abstraction?It is taking first the essential
elements of the thing to be represented, then the rest in the order of
importance (so that wherever we pause we shall always have obtained more
than we leave behind), and using any expedient to impress what we want
upon the mind, without caring about the mere literal accuracy of such
expedient.Suppose, for instance, we have to represent a peacock: now a
peacock has a graceful neck, so has a swan; it has a high crest, so has
a cockatoo; it has a long tail, so has a bird of Paradise.But the whole
spirit and power of peacock is in those eyes of the tail.It is true,
the argus pheasant, and one or two more birds, have something like them,
but nothing for a moment comparable to them in brilliancy: express the
gleaming of the blue eyes through the plumage, and you have nearly all
you want of peacock, but without this, nothing; and yet those eyes are
not in relief; a rigidly _true_ sculpture of a peacock's form could have
no eyes,--nothing but feathers.Here, then, enters the stratagem of
sculpture; you _must_ cut the eyes in relief, somehow or another; see
how it is done in the peacock on the opposite page; it is so done by
nearly all the Byzantine sculptors: this particular peacock is meant to
be seen at some distance (how far off I know not, for it is an
interpolation in the building where it occurs, of which more hereafter),
but at all events at a distance of thirty or forty feet; I have put it
close to you that you may see plainly the rude rings and rods which
stand for the eyes and quills, but at the just distance their effect is
perfect.And the simplicity of the means here employed may help us, both
to some clear understanding of the spirit of Ninevite and Egyptian work,
and to some perception of the kind of enfantillage or archaicism to
which it may be possible, even in days of advanced science, legitimately
to return.The architect has no right, as we said before, to require of
us a picture of Titian's in order to complete his design; neither has he
the right to calculate on the co-operation of perfect sculptors, in
subordinate capacities.Far from this; his business is to dispense with
such aid altogether, and to devise such a system of ornament as shall be
capable of execution by uninventive and even unintelligent workmen; for
supposing that he required noble sculpture for his ornament, how far
would this at once limit the number and the scale of possible buildings?Architecture is the work of nations; but we cannot have nations of great
sculptors.Every house in every street of every city ought to be good
architecture, but we cannot have Flaxman or Thorwaldsen at work upon it:
nor, even if we chose only to devote ourselves to our public buildings,
could the mass and majesty of them be great, if we required all to be
executed by great men; greatness is not to be had in the required
quantity.Giotto may design a campanile, but he cannot carve it; he can
only carve one or two of the bas-reliefs at the base of it.And with
every increase of your fastidiousness in the execution of your ornament,
you diminish the possible number and grandeur of your buildings.Do not
think you can educate your workmen, or that the demand for perfection
will increase the supply: educated imbecility and finessed foolishness
are the worst of all imbecilities and foolishnesses; and there is no
free-trade measure, which will ever lower the price of brains,--there is
no California of common sense.Exactly in the degree in which you
require your decoration to be wrought by thoughtful men, you diminish
the extent and number of architectural works.Your business as an
architect, is to calculate only on the co-operation of inferior men, to
think for them, and to indicate for them such expressions of your
thoughts as the weakest capacity can comprehend and the feeblest hand
can execute.This is the definition of the purest architectural
abstractions.They are the deep and laborious thoughts of the greatest
men, put into such easy letters that they can be written by the
simplest._They are expressions of the mind of manhood by the hands of
childhood._

Sec.And now suppose one of those old Ninevite or Egyptian builders,
with a couple of thousand men--mud-bred, onion-eating creatures--under
him, to be set to work, like so many ants, on his temple sculptures.He can put them through a granitic exercise
of current hand; he can teach them all how to curl hair thoroughly into
croche-coeurs, as you teach a bench of school-boys how to shape
pothooks; he can teach them all how to draw long eyes and straight
noses, and how to copy accurately certain well-defined lines.Then he
fits his own great design to their capacities; he takes out of king, or
lion, or god, as much as was expressible by croche-coeurs and granitic
pothooks; he throws this into noble forms of his own imagining, and
having mapped out their lines so that there can be no possibility of
error, sets his two thousand men to work upon them, with a will, and so
many onions a day.We have, with
Christianity, recognised the individual value of every soul; and there
is no intelligence so feeble but that its single ray may in some sort
contribute to the general light.This is the glory of Gothic
architecture, that every jot and tittle, every point and niche of it,
affords room, fuel, and focus for individual fire.But you cease to
acknowledge this, and you refuse to accept the help of the lesser mind,
if you require the work to be all executed in a great manner.Your
business is to think out all of it nobly, to dictate the expression of
it as far as your dictation can assist the less elevated intelligence:
then to leave this, aided and taught as far as may be, to its own simple
act and effort; and to rejoice in its simplicity if not in its power,
and in its vitality if not in its science.We have, then, three orders of ornament, classed according to
the degrees of correspondence of the executive and conceptive minds.We
have the servile ornament, in which the executive is absolutely subjected
to the inventive,--the ornament of the great Eastern nations, more
especially Hamite, and all pre-Christian, yet thoroughly noble in its
submissiveness.Then we have the mediaeval system, in which the mind of
the inferior workman is recognised, and has full room for action, but is
guided and ennobled by the ruling mind.This is the truly Christian and
only perfect system.Finally, we have ornaments expressing the endeavor
to equalise the executive and inventive,--endeavor which is Renaissance
and revolutionary, and destructive of all noble architecture.Thus far, then, of the incompleteness or simplicity of execution
necessary in architectural ornament, as referred to the mind.Next we
have to consider that which is required when it is referred to the
sight, and the various modifications of treatment which are rendered
necessary by the variation of its distance from the eye.I say
necessary: not merely expedient or economical.It is foolish to carve
what is to be seen forty feet off with the delicacy which the eye
demands within two yards; not merely because such delicacy is lost in
the distance, but because it is a great deal worse than lost:--the
delicate work has actually worse effect in the distance than rough work.This is a fact well known to painters, and, for the most part,
acknowledged by the critics of painters, namely, that there is a certain
distance for which a picture is painted; and that the finish, which is
delightful if that distance be small, is actually injurious if the
distance be great: and, moreover, that there is a particular method of
handling which none but consummate artists reach, which has its effects
at the intended distance, and is altogether hieroglyphical and
unintelligible at any other.This, I say, is acknowledged in painting,
but it is not practically acknowledged in architecture; nor until my
attention was especially directed to it, had I myself any idea of the
care with which this great question was studied by the mediaeval
architects.On my first careful examination of the capitals of the upper
arcade of the Ducal Palace at Venice, I was induced, by their singular
inferiority of workmanship, to suppose them posterior to those of the
lower arcade.It was not till I discovered that some of those which I
thought the worst above, were the best when seen from below, that I
obtained the key to this marvellous system of adaptation; a system
which I afterwards found carried out in every building of the great
times which I had opportunity of examining.There are two distinct modes in which this adaptation is
effected.In the first, the same designs which are delicately worked
when near the eye, are rudely cut, and have far fewer details when they
are removed from it.In this method it is not always easy to distinguish
economy from skill, or slovenliness from science.But, in the second
method, a different design is adopted, composed of fewer parts and of
simpler lines, and this is cut with exquisite precision.This is of
course the higher method, and the more satisfactory proof of purpose;
but an equal degree of imperfection is found in both kinds when they are
seen close; in the first, a bald execution of a perfect design; the
second, a baldness of design with perfect execution.And in these very
imperfections lies the admirableness of the ornament.It may be asked whether, in advocating this adaptation to the
distance of the eye, I obey my adopted rule of observance of natural
law.Are not all natural things, it may be asked, as lovely near as far
away?Look at the clouds, and watch the delicate sculpture
of their alabaster sides, and the rounded lustre of their magnificent
rolling.They are meant to be beheld far away; they were shaped for
their place, high above your head; approach them, and they fuse into
vague mists, or whirl away in fierce fragments of thunderous vapor.Look
at the crest of the Alp, from the far-away plains over which its light
is cast, whence human souls have communion with it by their myriads.The
child looks up to it in the dawn, and the husbandman in the burden and
heat of the day, and the old man in the going down of the sun, and it is
to them all as the celestial city on the world's horizon; dyed with the
depth of heaven, and clothed with the calm of eternity.There was it
set, for holy dominion, by Him who marked for the sun his journey, and
bade the moon know her going down.It was built for its place in the
far-off sky; approach it, and as the sound of the voice of man dies away
about its foundations, and the tide of human life, shallowed upon the
vast aerial shore, is at last met by the Eternal "Here shall thy waves
be stayed," the glory of its aspect fades into blanched fearfulness; its
purple walls are rent into grisly rocks, its silver fretwork saddened
into wasting snow, the storm-brands of ages are on its breast, the ashes
of its own ruin lie solemnly on its white raiment.Nor in such instances as these alone, though strangely enough, the
discrepancy between apparent and actual beauty is greater in proportion
to the unapproachableness of the object, is the law observed.For every
distance from the eye there is a peculiar kind of beauty, or a different
system of lines of form; the sight of that beauty is reserved for that
distance, and for that alone.If you approach nearer, that kind of
beauty is lost, and another succeeds, to be disorganised and reduced to
strange and incomprehensible means and appliances in its turn.If you
desire to perceive the great harmonies of the form of a rocky mountain,
you must not ascend upon its sides.All is there disorder and accident,
or seems so; sudden starts of its shattered beds hither and thither;
ugly struggles of unexpected strength from under the ground; fallen
fragments, toppling one over another into more helpless fall.Retire
from it, and, as your eye commands it more and more, as you see the
ruined mountain world with a wider glance, behold!dim sympathies begin
to busy themselves in the disjointed mass; line binds itself into
stealthy fellowship with line; group by group, the helpless fragments
gather themselves into ordered companies; new captains of hosts and
masses of battalions become visible, one by one, and far away answers of
foot to foot, and of bone to bone, until the powerless chaos is seen
risen up with girded loins, and not one piece of all the unregarded heap
could now be spared from the mystic whole.Now it is indeed true that where nature loses one kind of
beauty, as you approach it, she substitutes another; this is worthy of
her infinite power: and, as we shall see, art can sometimes follow her
even in doing this; but all I insist upon at present is, that the
several effects of nature are each worked with means referred to a
particular distance, and producing their effect at that distance only.Take a singular and marked instance: When the sun rises behind a ridge
of pines, and those pines are seen from a distance of a mile or two,
against his light, the whole form of the tree, trunk, branches, and all,
becomes one frostwork of intensely brilliant silver, which is relieved
against the clear sky like a burning fringe, for some distance on either
side of the sun.[71] Now suppose that a person who had never seen pines
were, for the first time in his life, to see them under this strange
aspect, and, reasoning as to the means by which such effect could be
produced, laboriously to approach the eastern ridge, how would he be
amazed to find that the fiery spectres had been produced by trees with
swarthy and grey trunks, and dark green leaves!We, in our simplicity,
if we had been required to produce such an appearance, should have built
up trees of chased silver, with trunks of glass, and then been
grievously amazed to find that, at two miles off, neither silver nor
glass were any more visible; but nature knew better, and prepared for
her fairy work with the strong branches and dark leaves, in her own
mysterious way.Now this is exactly what you have to do with your good ornament.It may be that it is capable of being approached, as well as likely to
be seen far away, and then it ought to have microscopic qualities, as
the pine leaves have, which will bear approach.But your calculation of
its purpose is for a glory to be produced at a given distance; it may be
here, or may be there, but it is a _given_ distance; and the excellence
of the ornament depends upon its fitting that distance, and being seen
better there than anywhere else, and having a particular function and
form which it can only discharge and assume there.You are never to say
that ornament has great merit because "you cannot see the beauty of it
here;" but, it has great merit because "you _can_ see its beauty _here
only_."And to give it this merit is just about as difficult a task as I
could well set you.I have above noted the two ways in which it is done:
the one, being merely rough cutting, may be passed over; the other,
which is scientific alteration of design, falls, itself, into two great
branches, Simplification and Emphasis.A word or two is necessary on each of these heads.When an ornamental work is intended to be seen near, if its
composition be indeed fine, the subdued and delicate portions of the
design lead to, and unite, the energetic parts, and those energetic
parts form with the rest a whole, in which their own immediate relations
to each other are not perceived.Remove this design to a distance, and
the connecting delicacies vanish, the energies alone remain, now either
disconnected altogether, or assuming with each other new relations,
which, not having been intended by the designer, will probably be
painful.There is a like, and a more palpable, effect, in the retirement
of a band of music in which the instruments are of very unequal powers;
the fluting and fifeing expire, the drumming remains, and that in a
painful arrangement, as demanding something which is unheard.In like
manner, as the designer at arm's length removes or elevates his work,
fine gradations, and roundings, and incidents, vanish, and a totally
unexpected arrangement is established between the remainder of the
markings, certainly confused, and in all probability painful.The art of architectural design is therefore, first, the
preparation for this beforehand, the rejection of all the delicate
passages as worse than useless, and the fixing the thought upon the
arrangement of the features which will remain visible far away.Nor does
this always imply a diminution of resource; for, while it may be assumed
as a law that fine modulation of surface in light becomes quickly
invisible as the object retires, there are a softness and mystery given
to the harder markings, which enable them to be safely used as media of
expression.There is an exquisite example of this use, in the head of
the Adam of the Ducal Palace.It is only at the height of 17 or 18 feet
above the eye; nevertheless, the sculptor felt it was no use to trouble
himself about drawing the corners of the mouth, or the lines of the
lips, delicately, at that distance; his object has been to mark them
clearly, and to prevent accidental shadows from concealing them, or
altering their expression.The lips are cut thin and sharp, so that
their line cannot be mistaken, and a good deep drill-hole struck into
the angle of the mouth; the eye is anxious and questioning, and one is
surprised, from below, to perceive a kind of darkness in the iris of it,
neither like color, nor like a circular furrow.The expedient can only
be discovered by ascending to the level of the head; it is one which
would have been quite inadmissible except in distant work, six
drill-holes cut into the iris, round a central one for the pupil.By just calculation, like this, of the means at our disposal,
by beautiful arrangement of the prominent features, and by choice of
different subjects for different places, choosing the broadest forms for
the farthest distance, it is possible to give the impression, not only
of perfection, but of an exquisite delicacy, to the most distant
ornament.And this is the true sign of the right having been done, and
the utmost possible power attained:--The spectator should be satisfied
to stay in his place, feeling the decoration, wherever it may be,
equally rich, full, and lovely: not desiring to climb the steeples in
order to examine it, but sure that he has it all, where he is.Perhaps
the capitals of the cathedral of Genoa are the best instances of
absolute perfection in this kind: seen from below, they appear as rich
as the frosted silver of the Strada degli Orefici; and the nearer you
approach them, the less delicate they seem.This is, however, not the only mode, though the best, in which
ornament is adapted for distance.The other is emphasis,--the unnatural
insisting upon explanatory lines, where the subject would otherwise
become unintelligible.It is to be remembered that, by a deep and narrow
incision, an architect has the power, at least in sunshine, of drawing a
black line on stone, just as vigorously as it can be drawn with chalk on
grey paper; and that he may thus, wherever and in the degree that he
chooses, substitute _chalk sketching_ for sculpture.They are curiously
mingled by the Romans.The bas-reliefs of the Arc d'Orange are small,
and would be confused, though in bold relief, if they depended for
intelligibility on the relief only; but each figure is outlined by a
strong _incision_ at its edge into the background, and all the ornaments
on the armor are simply drawn with incised lines, and not cut out at
all.A similar use of lines is made by the Gothic nations in all their
early sculpture, and with delicious effect.Now, to draw a mere
pattern--as, for instance, the bearings of a shield--with these simple
incisions, would, I suppose, occupy an able sculptor twenty minutes or
half an hour; and the pattern is then clearly seen, under all
circumstances of light and shade; there can be no mistake about it, and
no missing it.To carve out the bearings in due and finished relief
would occupy a long summer's day, and the results would be feeble and
indecipherable in the best lights, and in some lights totally and
hopelessly invisible, ignored, non-existant.Now the Renaissance
architects, and our modern ones, despise the simple expedient of the
rough Roman or barbarian.They care
only to speak finely, and be thought great orators, if one could only
hear them.So I leave you to choose between the old men, who took
minutes to tell things plainly, and the modern men, who take days to
tell them unintelligibly.All expedients of this kind, both of simplification and energy,
for the expression of details at a distance where their actual forms
would have been invisible, but more especially this linear method, I
shall call Proutism; for the greatest master of the art in modern times
has been Samuel Prout.He actually takes up buildings of the later times
in which the ornament has been too refined for its place, and
translates it into the energised linear ornament of earlier art: and to
this power of taking the life and essence of decoration, and putting it
into a perfectly intelligible form, when its own fulness would have been
confused, is owing the especial power of his drawings.Nothing can be
more closely analogous than the method with which an old Lombard uses
his chisel, and that with which Prout uses the reed-pen; and we shall
see presently farther correspondence in their feeling about the
enrichment of luminous surfaces.Now, all that has been hitherto said refers to ornament whose
distance is fixed, or nearly so; as when it is at any considerable
height from the ground, supposing the spectator to desire to see it, and
to get as near it as he can.But the distance of ornament is never fixed
to the _general_ spectator.The tower of a cathedral is bound to look
well, ten miles off, or five miles, or half a mile, or within fifty
yards.The ornaments of its top have fixed distances, compared with
those of its base; but quite unfixed distances in their relation to the
great world: and the ornaments of the base have no fixed distance at
all.They are bound to look well from the other side of the cathedral
close, and to look equally well, or better, as we enter the cathedral
door.XVII., that for
every distance from the eye there was a different system of form in all
natural objects: this is to be so then in architecture.The lesser
ornament is to be grafted on the greater, and third or fourth orders of
ornaments upon this again, as need may be, until we reach the limits of
possible sight; each order of ornament being adapted for a different
distance: first, for example, the great masses,--the buttresses and
stories and black windows and broad cornices of the tower, which give it
make, and organism, as it rises over the horizon, half a score of miles
away: then the traceries and shafts and pinnacles, which give it
richness as we approach: then the niches and statues and knobs and
flowers, which we can only see when we stand beneath it.At this third
order of ornament, we may pause, in the upper portions; but on the
roofs of the niches, and the robes of the statues, and the rolls of the
mouldings, comes a fourth order of ornament, as delicate as the eye can
follow, when any of these features may be approached.All good ornamentation is thus arborescent, as it were,
one class of it branching out of another and sustained by it; and its
nobility consists in this, that whatever order or class of it we may be
contemplating, we shall find it subordinated to a greater, simpler, and
more powerful; and if we then contemplate the greater order, we shall
find it again subordinated to a greater still; until the greatest can
only be quite grasped by retiring to the limits of distance commanding
it.And if this subordination be not complete, the ornament is bad: if the
figurings and chasings and borderings of a dress be not subordinated to
the folds of it,--if the folds are not subordinate to the action and
mass of the figure,--if this action and mass not to the divisions of the
recesses and shafts among which it stands,--if these not to the shadows
of the great arches and buttresses of the whole building, in each case
there is error; much more if all be contending with each other and
striving for attention at the same time.It is nevertheless evident, that, however perfect this
distribution, there cannot be orders adapted to _every_ distance of the
spectator.Between the ranks of ornament there must always be a bold
separation; and there must be many intermediate distances, where we are
too far off to see the lesser rank clearly, and yet too near to grasp
the next higher rank wholly: and at all these distances the spectator
will feel himself ill-placed, and will desire to go nearer or farther
away.This must be the case in all noble work, natural or artificial.It
is exactly the same with respect to Rouen cathedral or the Mont Blanc.We like to see them from the other side of the Seine, or of the lake of
Geneva; from the Marche aux Fleurs, or the Valley of Chamouni; from the
parapets of the apse, or the crags of the Montagne de la Cote: but there
are intermediate distances which dissatisfy us in either case, and from
which one is in haste either to advance or to retire.Directly opposed to this ordered, disciplined, well officered
and variously ranked ornament, this type of divine, and therefore of all
good human government, is the democratic ornament, in which all is
equally influential, and has equal office and authority; that is to say,
none of it any office nor authority, but a life of continual struggle
for independence and notoriety, or of gambling for chance regards.The
English perpendicular work is by far the worst of this kind that I know;
its main idea, or decimal fraction of an idea, being to cover its walls
with dull, successive, eternity of reticulation, to fill with equal
foils the equal interstices between the equal bars, and charge the
interminable blanks with statues and rosettes, invisible at a distance,
and uninteresting near.The early Lombardic, Veronese, and Norman work is the exact reverse of
this; being divided first into large masses, and these masses covered
with minute chasing and surface work, which fill them with interest, and
yet do not disturb nor divide their greatness.The lights are kept broad
and bright, and yet are found on near approach to be charged with
intricate design.This, again, is a part of the great system of
treatment which I shall hereafter call "Proutism;" much of what is
thought mannerism and imperfection in Prout's work, being the result of
his determined resolution that minor details shall never break up his
large masses of light.Such are the main principles to be observed in the adaptation of
ornament to the sight.We have lastly to inquire by what method, and in
what quantities, the ornament, thus adapted to mental contemplation, and
prepared for its physical position, may most wisely be arranged.I think
the method ought first to be considered, and the quantity last; for the
advisable quantity depends upon the method.It was said above, that the proper treatment or arrangement of
ornament was that which expressed the laws and ways of Deity.Now, the
subordination of visible orders to each other, just noted, is one
expression of these.But there may also--must also--be a subordination
and obedience of the parts of each order to some visible law, out of
itself, but having reference to itself only (not to any upper order):
some law which shall not oppress, but guide, limit, and sustain.In the tenth chapter of the second volume of "Modern Painters," the
reader will find that I traced one part of the beauty of God's creation
to the expression of a _self_-restrained liberty: that is to say, the
image of that perfection of _divine_ action, which, though free to work
in arbitrary methods, works always in consistent methods, called by us
Laws.Now, correspondingly, we find that when these natural objects are to
become subjects of the art of man, their perfect treatment is an image
of the perfection of _human_ action: a voluntary submission to divine
law.It was suggested to me but lately by the friend to whose originality of
thought I have before expressed my obligations, Mr.Newton, that the
Greek pediment, with its enclosed sculptures, represented to the Greek
mind the law of Fate, confining human action within limits not to be
overpassed.I do not believe the Greeks ever distinctly thought of this;
but the instinct of all the human race, since the world began, agrees in
some expression of such limitation as one of the first necessities of
good ornament.[72] And this expression is heightened, rather than
diminished, when some portion of the design slightly breaks the law to
which the rest is subjected; it is like expressing the use of miracles
in the divine government; or, perhaps, in slighter degrees, the relaxing
of a law, generally imperative, in compliance with some more imperative
need--the hungering of David.How eagerly this special infringement of a
general law was sometimes sought by the mediaeval workmen, I shall be
frequently able to point out to the reader; but I remember just now a
most curious instance, in an archivolt of a house in the Corte del Remer
close to the Rialto at Venice.It is composed of a wreath of
flower-work--a constant Byzantine design--with an animal in each coil;
the whole enclosed between two fillets.Each animal, leaping or eating,
scratching or biting, is kept nevertheless strictly within its coil, and
between the fillets.Not the shake of an ear, not the tip of a tail,
overpasses this appointed line, through a series of some five-and-twenty
or thirty animals; until, on a sudden, and by mutual consent, two little
beasts (not looking, for the rest, more rampant than the others), one on
each side, lay their small paws across the enclosing fillet at exactly
the same point of its course, and thus break the continuity of its line.Two ears of corn, or leaves, do the same thing in the mouldings round
the northern door of the Baptistery at Florence.Observe, however, and this is of the utmost possible
importance, that the value of this type does not consist in the mere
shutting of the ornament into a certain space, but in the acknowledgment
_by_ the ornament of the fitness of the limitation--of its own perfect
willingness to submit to it; nay, of a predisposition in itself to fall
into the ordained form, without any direct expression of the command to
do so; an anticipation of the authority, and an instant and willing
submission to it, in every fibre and spray: not merely _willing_, but
_happy_ submission, as being pleased rather than vexed to have so
beautiful a law suggested to it, and one which to follow is so justly in
accordance with its own nature.You must not cut out a branch of
hawthorn as it grows, and rule a triangle round it, and suppose that it
is then submitted to law.It is only put in a cage, and
will look as if it must get out, for its life, or wither in the
confinement.But the spirit of triangle must be put into the hawthorn.It must suck in isoscelesism with its sap.Thorn and blossom, leaf and
spray, must grow with an awful sense of triangular necessity upon them,
for the guidance of which they are to be thankful, and to grow all the
stronger and more gloriously.And though there may be a transgression
here and there, and an adaptation to some other need, or a reaching
forth to some other end greater even than the triangle, yet this liberty
is to be always accepted under a solemn sense of special permission; and
when the full form is reached and the entire submission expressed, and
every blossom has a thrilling sense of its responsibility down into its
tiniest stamen, you may take your terminal line away if you will.The commandment is written on the heart of the
thing.Then, besides this obedience to external law, there is the
obedience to internal headship, which constitutes the unity of ornament,
of which I think enough has been said for my present purpose in the
chapter on Unity in the second vol.But I hardly
know whether to arrange as an expression of a divine law, or a
representation of a physical fact, the alternation of shade with light
which, in equal succession, forms one of the chief elements of
_continuous_ ornament, and in some peculiar ones, such as dentils and
billet mouldings, is the source of their only charm.The opposition of
good and evil, the antagonism of the entire human system (so ably worked
out by Lord Lindsay), the alternation of labor with rest, the mingling
of life with death, or the actual physical fact of the division of light
from darkness, and of the falling and rising of night and day, are all
typified or represented by these chains of shade and light of which the
eye never wearies, though their true meaning may never occur to the
thoughts.The next question respecting the arrangement of ornament is
one closely connected also with its quantity.The system of creation is
one in which "God's creatures leap not, but express a feast, where all the
guests sit close, and nothing wants."It is also a feast, where there is
nothing redundant.So, then, in distributing our ornament, there must
never be any sense of gap or blank, neither any sense of there being a
single member, or fragment of a member, which could be spared.Whatever
has nothing to do, whatever could go without being missed, is not
ornament; it is deformity and encumbrance.And, on the
other hand, care must be taken either to diffuse the ornament which we
permit, in due relation over the whole building, or so to concentrate
it, as never to leave a sense of its having got into knots, and curdled
upon some points, and left the rest of the building whey.It is very
difficult to give the rules, or analyse the feelings, which should
direct us in this matter: for some shafts may be carved and others left
unfinished, and that with advantage; some windows may be jewelled like
Aladdin's, and one left plain, and still with advantage; the door or
doors, or a single turret, or the whole western facade of a church, or
the apse or transept, may be made special subjects of decoration, and
the rest left plain, and still sometimes with advantage.But in all such
cases there is either sign of that feeling which I advocated in the
First Chapter of the "Seven Lamps," the desire of rather doing some
portion of the building as we would have it, and leaving the rest plain,
than doing the whole imperfectly; or else there is choice made of some
important feature, to which, as more honorable than the rest, the
decoration is confined.The evil is when, without system, and without
preference of the nobler members, the ornament alternates between sickly
luxuriance and sudden blankness.In many of our Scotch and English
abbeys, especially Melrose, this is painfully felt; but the worst
instance I have ever seen is the window in the side of the arch under
the Wellington statue, next St.In the first place, a
window has no business there at all; in the second, the bars of the
window are not the proper place for decoration, especially _wavy_
decoration, which one instantly fancies of cast iron; in the third, the
richness of the ornament is a mere patch and eruption upon the wall, and
one hardly knows whether to be most irritated at the affectation of
severity in the rest, or at the vain luxuriance of the dissolute
parallelogram.Finally, as regards quantity of ornament I have already said,
again and again, you cannot have too much if it be good; that is, if it
be thoroughly united and harmonised by the laws hitherto insisted upon.But you may easily have too much if you have more than you have sense to
manage.For with every added order of ornament increases the difficulty
of discipline.It is exactly the same as in war: you cannot, as an
abstract law, have too many soldiers, but you may easily have more than
the country is able to sustain, or than your generalship is competent
to command.And every regiment which you cannot manage will, on the day
of battle, be in your way, and encumber the movements it is not in
disposition to sustain.As an architect, therefore, you are modestly to measure
your capacity of governing ornament.Remember, its essence,--its being
ornament at all, consists in its being governed.Lose your authority
over it, let it command you, or lead you, or dictate to you in any wise,
and it is an offence, an incumbrance, and a dishonor.And it is always
ready to do this; wild to get the bit in its teeth, and rush forth on
its own devices.Measure, therefore, your strength; and as long as there
is no chance of mutiny, add soldier to soldier, battalion to battalion;
but be assured that all are heartily in the cause, and that there is not
one of whose position you are ignorant, or whose service you could
spare.FOOTNOTES:

  [70] Vide "Seven Lamps," Chap.[71] Shakspeare and Wordsworth (I think they only) have noticed this,
    Shakspeare, in Richard II.:--

      "But when, from under this terrestrial ball,
       He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines."And Wordsworth, in one of his minor poems, on leaving Italy:

      "My thoughts become bright like yon edging of pines
       On the steep's lofty verge--how it blackened the air!But, touched from behind by the sun, it now shines
       With threads that seem part of his own silver hair."[72] Some valuable remarks on this subject will be found in a notice
    of the "Seven Lamps" in the British Quarterly for August, 1849.I
    think, however, the writer attaches too great importance to one out
    of many ornamental necessities.I. We have now examined the treatment and specific kinds of ornament
at our command.We have lastly to note the fittest places for their
disposal.Not but that all kinds of ornament are used in all places; but
there are some parts of the building, which, without ornament, are more
painful than others, and some which wear ornament more gracefully than
others; so that, although an able architect will always be finding out
some new and unexpected modes of decoration, and fitting his ornament
into wonderful places where it is least expected, there are,
nevertheless, one or two general laws which may be noted respecting
every one of the parts of a building, laws not (except a few) imperative
like those of construction, but yet generally expedient, and good to be
understood, if it were only that we might enjoy the brilliant methods in
which they are sometimes broken.I shall note, however, only a few of
the simplest; to trace them into their ramifications, and class in due
order the known or possible methods of decoration for each part of a
building, would alone require a large volume, and be, I think, a
somewhat useless work; for there is often a high pleasure in the very
unexpectedness of the ornament, which would be destroyed by too
elaborate an arrangement of its kinds.I think that the reader must, by this time, so thoroughly
understand the connection of the parts of a building, that I may class
together, in treating of decoration, several parts which I kept separate
in speaking of construction.Thus I shall put under one head (A) the
base of the wall and of the shaft; then (B) the wall veil and shaft
itself; then (C) the cornice and capital; then (D) the jamb and
archivolt, including the arches both over shafts and apertures, and the
jambs of apertures, which are closely connected with their archivolts;
finally (E) the roof, including the real roof, and the minor roofs or
gables of pinnacles and arches.I think, under these divisions, all may
be arranged which is necessary to be generally stated; for tracery
decorations or aperture fillings are but smaller forms of application of
the arch, and the cusps are merely smaller spandrils, while buttresses
have, as far as I know, no specific ornament.The best are those which
have least; and the little they have resolves itself into pinnacles,
which are common to other portions of the building, or into small
shafts, arches, and niches, of still more general applicability.We
shall therefore have only five divisions to examine in succession, from
foundation to roof.But in the decoration of these several parts, certain minor
conditions of ornament occur which are of perfectly general application.For instance, whether, in archivolts, jambs, or buttresses, or in square
piers, or at the extremity of the entire building, we necessarily have
the awkward (moral or architectural) feature, the _corner_.How to turn
a corner gracefully becomes, therefore, a perfectly general question; to
be examined without reference to any particular part of the edifice.Again, the furrows and ridges by which bars of parallel light and
shade are obtained, whether these are employed in arches, or jambs, or
bases, or cornices, must of necessity present one or more of six forms:
square projection, _a_ (Fig.), or square recess, _b_, sharp
projection, _c_, or sharp recess, _d_, curved projection, _e_, or curved
recess, _f_.What odd curves the projection or recess may assume, or how
these different conditions may be mixed and run into one another, is
not our present business.We note only the six distinct kinds or types.Now, when these ridges or furrows are on a small scale they often
themselves constitute all the ornament required for larger features, and
are left smooth cut; but on a very large scale they are apt to become
insipid, and they require a sub-ornament of their own, the consideration
of which is, of course, in great part, general, and irrespective of the
place held by the mouldings in the building itself: which consideration
I think we had better undertake first of all.V. But before we come to particular examination of these minor forms,
let us see how far we can simplify it.There are distinguished in it six forms of moulding.Of these, _c_ is
nothing but a small corner; but, for convenience sake, it is better to
call it an edge, and to consider its decoration together with that of
the member _a_, which is called a fillet; while _e_, which I shall call
a roll (because I do not choose to assume that it shall be only of the
semicircular section here given), is also best considered together with
its relative recess, _f_; and because the shape of a recess is of no
great consequence, I shall class all the three recesses together, and we
shall thus have only three subjects for separate consideration:--

  1.There are two other general forms which may probably occur to the
reader's mind, namely, the ridge (as of a roof), which is a corner laid
on its back, or sloping,--a supine corner, decorated in a very different
manner from a stiff upright corner: and the point, which is a
concentrated corner, and has wonderfully elaborate decorations all to
its insignificant self, finials, and spikes, and I know not what more.But both these conditions are so closely connected with roofs (even the
cusp finial being a kind of pendant to a small roof), that I think it
better to class them and their ornament under the head of roof
decoration, together with the whole tribe of crockets and bosses; so
that we shall be here concerned only with the three subjects above
distinguished: and, first, the corner or Angle.The mathematician knows there are many kinds of angles; but the
one we have principally to deal with now, is that which the reader may
very easily conceive as the corner of a square house, or square
anything.It is of course the one of most frequent occurrence; and its
treatment, once understood, may, with slight modification, be referred
to other corners, sharper or blunter, or with curved sides.Evidently the first and roughest idea which would occur to any
one who found a corner troublesome, would be to cut it off.This is a
very summary and tyrannical proceeding, somewhat barbarous, yet
advisable if nothing else can be done: an amputated corner is said to be
chamfered.It can, however, evidently be cut off in three ways: 1. with
a concave cut, _a_; 2. with a straight cut, _b_; 3. with a convex cut,
_c_, Fig.The first two methods, the most violent and summary, have the apparent
disadvantage that we get by them,--two corners instead of one; much
milder corners, however, and with a different light and shade between
them; so that both methods are often very expedient.You may see the
straight chamfer (_b_) on most lamp posts, and pillars at railway
stations, it being the easiest to cut: the concave chamfer requires more
care, and occurs generally in well-finished but simple architecture--very
beautifully in the small arches of the Broletto of Como, Plate V.; and
the straight chamfer in architecture of every kind, very constantly in
Norman cornices and arches, as in Fig.The third, or convex chamfer, as it is the gentlest mode of
treatment, so (as in medicine and morals) it is very generally the best.For while the two other methods produce two corners instead of one, this
gentle chamfer does verily get rid of the corner altogether, and
substitutes a soft curve in its place.But it has, in the form above given, this grave disadvantage, that it
looks as if the corner had been rubbed or worn off, blunted by time and
weather, and in want of sharpening again.A great deal often depends,
and in such a case as this, everything depends, on the _Voluntariness_
of the ornament.The work of time is beautiful on surfaces, but not on
edges intended to be sharp.Even if we needed them blunt, we should not
like them blunt on compulsion; so, to show that the bluntness is our own
ordaining, we will put a slight incised line to mark off the rounding,
and show that it goes no farther than we choose.We shall thus have the
section _a_, Fig.; and this mode of turning an angle is one of the
very best ever invented.By enlarging and deepening the incision, we get
in succession the forms _b_, _c_, _d_; and by describing a small equal
arc on each of the sloping lines of these figures, we get _e_, _f_, _g_,
_h_.X. I do not know whether these mouldings are called by architects
chamfers or beads; but I think _bead_ a bad word for a continuous
moulding, and the proper sense of the word chamfer is fixed by Spenser
as descriptive not merely of truncation, but of trench or furrow:--

  "Tho gin you, fond flies, the cold to scorn,
   And, crowing in pipes made of green corn,
   You thinken to be lords of the year;
   But eft when ye count you freed from fear,
   Comes the breme winter with chamfred brows,
   Full of wrinkles and frosty furrows."So I shall call the above mouldings beaded chamfers, when there is any
chance of confusion with the plain chamfer, _a_, or _b_, of Fig.:
and when there is no such chance, I shall use the word chamfer only.Of those above given, _b_ is the constant chamfer of Venice, and
_a_ of Verona: _a_ being the grandest and best, and having a peculiar
precision and quaintness of effect about it.I found it twice in Venice,
used on the sharp angle, as at _a_ and _b_, Fig.LIV., _a_ being from
the angle of a house on the Rio San Zulian, and _b_ from the windows of
the church of San Stefano.There is, however, evidently another variety of the chamfers,
_f_ and _g_, Fig.LIII., formed by an unbroken curve instead of two
curves, as _c_, Fig.; and when this, or the chamfer _d_, Fig.LIII.,
is large, it is impossible to say whether they have been devised from the
incised angle, or from small shafts set in a nook, as at _e_, Fig.LIV.,
or in the hollow of the curved chamfer, as _d_, Fig.In general,
however, the shallow chamfers, _a_, _b_, _e_, and _f_, Fig.LIII., are
peculiar to southern work; and may be assumed to have been derived from
the incised angle, while the deep chamfers, _c_, _d_, _g_, _h_, are
characteristic of northern work, and may be partly derived or imitated
from the angle shaft; while, with the usual extravagance of the northern
architects, they are cut deeper and deeper until we arrive at the
condition _f_, Fig.LIV., which is the favorite chamfer at Bourges and
Bayeux, and in other good French work.I have placed in the Appendix[73] a figure belonging to this subject,
but which cannot interest the general reader, showing the number of
possible chamfers with a roll moulding of given size.If we take the plain chamfer, _b_, of Fig.LII., on a large
scale, as at _a_, Fig.LV., and bead both its edges, cutting away the
parts there shaded, we shall have a form much used in richly decorated
Gothic, both in England and Italy.It might be more simply described as
the chamfer _a_ of Fig.LII., with an incision on each edge; but the
part here shaded is often worked into ornamental forms, not being
entirely cut away.Many other mouldings, which at first sight appear very
elaborate, are nothing more than a chamfer, with a series of small echoes
of it on each side, dying away with a ripple on the surface of the wall,
as in _b_, Fig.LV., from Coutances (observe, here the white part is the
solid stone, the shade is cut away).Chamfers of this kind are used on a small scale and in delicate work:
the coarse chamfers are found on all scales: _f_ and _g_, Fig.LIII., in
Venice, form the great angles of almost every Gothic palace; the roll
being a foot or a foot and a half round, and treated as a shaft, with a
capital and fresh base at every story, while the stones of which it is
composed form alternate quoins in the brickwork beyond the chamfer
curve.I need hardly say how much nobler this arrangement is than a
common quoined angle; it gives a finish to the aspect of the whole pile
attainable in no other way.And thus much may serve concerning angle
decoration by chamfer.FOOTNOTES:

  [73] Appendix 23: "Varieties of Chamfer."I. The decoration of the angle by various forms of chamfer and bead,
as above described, is the quietest method we can employ; too quiet,
when great energy is to be given to the moulding, and impossible, when,
instead of a bold angle, we have to deal with a small projecting edge,
like _c_ in Fig.In such cases we may employ a decoration, far ruder
and easier in its simplest conditions than the bead, far more effective
when not used in too great profusion; and of which the complete
developments are the source of mouldings at once the most picturesque
and most serviceable which the Gothic builders invented.The gunwales of the Venetian heavy barges being liable to
somewhat rough collision with each other, and with the walls of the
streets, are generally protected by a piece of timber, which projects in
the form of the fillet, _a_, Fig.; but which, like all other fillets,
may, if we so choose, be considered as composed of two angles or edges,
which the natural and most wholesome love of the Venetian boatmen for
ornament, otherwise strikingly evidenced by their painted sails and
glittering flag-vanes, will not suffer to remain wholly undecorated.The
rough service of these timbers, however, will not admit of rich ornament,
and the boatbuilder usually contents himself with cutting a series of
notches in each edge, one series alternating with the other, as
represented at 1, Plate IX.In that simple ornament, not as confined to Venetian boats,
but as representative of a general human instinct to hack at an edge,
demonstrated by all school-boys and all idle possessors of penknives or
other cutting instruments on both sides of the Atlantic;--in that rude
Venetian gunwale, I say, is the germ of all the ornament which has
touched, with its rich successions of angular shadow, the portals and
archivolts of nearly every early building of importance, from the North
Cape to the Straits of Messina.Nor are the modifications of the first
suggestion intricate.All that is generic in their character may be seen
on Plate IX.Taking a piece of stone instead of timber, and enlarging the
notches, until they meet each other, we have the condition 2, which is a
moulding from the tomb of the Doge Andrea Dandolo, in St.Now,
considering this moulding as composed of two decorated edges, each edge
will be reduced, by the meeting of the notches, to a series of
four-sided pyramids (as marked off by the dotted lines), which, the
notches here being shallow, will be shallow pyramids; but by deepening
the notches, we get them as at 3, with a profile _a_, more or less
steep.This moulding I shall always call "the plain dogtooth;" it is
used in profusion in the Venetian and Veronese Gothic, generally set
with its front to the spectator, as here at 3; but its effect may be
much varied by placing it obliquely (4, and profile as at _b_); or with
one side horizontal (5, and profile _c_).Of these three conditions, 3
and 5 are exactly the same in reality, only differently placed; but in 4
the pyramid is obtuse, and the inclination of its base variable, the
upper side of it being always kept vertical.Of the three, the last, 5, is far the most brilliant in effect, giving
in the distance a zigzag form to the high light on it, and a full sharp
shadow below.The use of this shadow is sufficiently seen by fig.7 in
this plate (the arch on the left, the number beneath it), in which these
levelled dogteeth, with a small interval between each, are employed to
set off by their vigor the delicacy of floral ornament above.This arch
is the side of a niche from the tomb of Can Signorio della Scala, at
Verona; and the value, as well as the distant expression of its
dogtooth, may be seen by referring to Prout's beautiful drawing of this
tomb in his "Sketches in France and Italy."I have before observed
that this artist never fails of seizing the true and leading expression
of whatever he touches: he has made this ornament the leading feature of
the niche, expressing it, as in distance it is only expressible, by a
zigzag.V. The reader may perhaps be surprised at my speaking so highly of
this drawing, if he take the pains to compare Prout's symbolism of the
work on the niche with the facts as they stand here in Plate IX.But the
truth is that Prout has rendered the effect of the monument on the mind
of the passer-by;--the effect it was intended to have on every man who
turned the corner of the street beneath it: and in this sense there is
actually more truth and likeness[74] in Prout's translation than in my
fac-simile, made diligently by peering into the details from a ladder.I
do not say that all the symbolism in Prout's Sketch is the best
possible; but it is the best which any architectural draughtsman has yet
invented; and in its application to special subjects it always shows
curious internal evidence that the sketch has been made on the spot, and
that the artist tried to draw what he saw, not to invent an attractive
subject.The dogtooth, employed in this simple form, is, however, rather
a foil for other ornament, than itself a satisfactory or generally
available decoration.It is, however, easy to enrich it as we choose:
taking up its simple form at 3, and describing the arcs marked by the
dotted lines upon its sides, and cutting a small triangular cavity
between them, we shall leave its ridges somewhat rudely representative
of four leaves, as at 8, which is the section and front view of one of
the Venetian stone cornices described above, Chap.IV., the
figure 8 being here put in the hollow of the gutter.The dogtooth is put
on the outer lower truncation, and is actually in position as fig.5;
but being always looked up to, is to the spectator as 3, and always
rich and effective.The dogteeth are perhaps most frequently expanded
to the width of fig.As in nearly all other ornaments previously described, so in
this,--we have only to deepen the Italian cutting, and we shall get the
Northern type.If we make the original pyramid somewhat steeper, and
instead of lightly incising, cut it through, so as to have the leaves
held only by their points to the base, we shall have the English
dogtooth; somewhat vulgar in its piquancy, when compared with French
mouldings of a similar kind.[75] It occurs, I think, on one house in
Venice, in the Campo St.Polo; but the ordinary moulding, with light
incisions, is frequent in archivolts and architraves, as well as in the
roof cornices.This being the simplest treatment of the pyramid, fig.10, from
the refectory of Wenlock Abbey, is an example of the simplest decoration
of the recesses or inward angles between the pyramids; that is to say,
of a simple hacked edge like one of those in fig.2, the _cuts_ being
taken up and decorated instead of the _points_.Each is worked into a
small trefoiled arch, with an incision round it to mark its outline, and
another slight incision above, expressing the angle of the first
cutting.7 had in distance the effect of a
zigzag: in fig.10 this zigzag effect is seized upon and developed, but
with the easiest and roughest work; the angular incision being a mere
limiting line, like that described in Sec.But
hence the farther steps to every condition of Norman ornament are self
evident.I do not say that all of them arose from development of the
dogtooth in this manner, many being quite independent inventions and
uses of zigzag lines; still, they may all be referred to this simple
type as their root and representative, that is to say, the mere hack of
the Venetian gunwale, with a limiting line following the resultant
zigzag.11 is a singular and much more artificial condition, cast
in brick, from the church of the Frari, and given here only for future
reference.12, resulting from a fillet with the cuts on each of its
edges interrupted by a bar, is a frequent Venetian moulding, and of
great value; but the plain or leaved dogteeth have been the favorites,
and that to such a degree, that even the Renaissance architects took
them up; and the best bit of Renaissance design in Venice, the side of
the Ducal Palace next the Bridge of Sighs, owes great part of its
splendor to its foundation, faced with large flat dogteeth, each about a
foot wide in the base, with their points truncated, and alternating with
cavities which are their own negatives or casts.X. One other form of the dogtooth is of great importance in northern
architecture, that produced by oblique cuts slightly curved, as in the
margin, Fig.It is susceptible of the most fantastic and endless
decoration; each of the resulting leaves being, in the early porches of
Rouen and Lisieux, hollowed out and worked into branching tracery: and
at Bourges, for distant effect, worked into plain leaves, or bold bony
processes with knobs at the points, and near the spectator, into
crouching demons and broad winged owls, and other fancies and
intricacies, innumerable and inexpressible.Thus much is enough to be noted respecting edge decoration.Professor Willis has noticed an
ornament, which he has called the Venetian dentil, "as the most
universal ornament in its own district that ever I met with;" but has
not noticed the reason for its frequency.The whole early architecture of Venice is architecture of incrustation:
this has not been enough noticed in its peculiar relation to that of the
rest of Italy.There is, indeed, much incrusted architecture throughout
Italy, in elaborate ecclesiastical work, but there is more which is
frankly of brick, or thoroughly of stone.But the Venetian habitually
incrusted his work with nacre; he built his houses, even the meanest, as
if he had been a shell-fish,--roughly inside, mother-of-pearl on the
surface: he was content, perforce, to gather the clay of the Brenta
banks, and bake it into brick for his substance of wall; but he overlaid
it with the wealth of ocean, with the most precious foreign marbles.You
might fancy early Venice one wilderness of brick, which a petrifying sea
had beaten upon till it coated it with marble: at first a dark
city--washed white by the sea foam.And I told you before that it was
also a city of shafts and arches, and that its dwellings were raised
upon continuous arcades, among which the sea waves wandered.Hence the
thoughts of its builders were early and constantly directed to the
incrustation of arches.I have given two of these Byzantine stilted
arches: the one on the right, _a_, as they now too often appear, in its
bare brickwork; that on the left, with its alabaster covering, literally
marble defensive armor, riveted together in pieces, which follow the
contours of the building.Now, on the wall, these pieces are mere flat
slabs cut to the arch outline; but under the soffit of the arch the
marble mail is curved, often cut singularly thin, like bent tiles, and
fitted together so that the pieces would sustain each other even without
rivets.It is of course desirable that this thin sub-arch of marble
should project enough to sustain the facing of the wall; and the reader
will see, in Fig.LVII., that its edge forms a kind of narrow band round
the arch (_b_), a band which the least enrichment would render a
valuable decorative feature.Now this band is, of course, if the
soffit-pieces project a little beyond the face of the wall-pieces, a
mere fillet, like the wooden gunwale in Plate IX.; and the question is,
how to enrich it most wisely.It might easily have been dogtoothed, but
the Byzantine architects had not invented the dogtooth, and would not
have used it here, if they had; for the dogtooth cannot be employed
alone, especially on so principal an angle as this of the main arches,
without giving to the whole building a peculiar look, which I can not
otherwise describe than as being to the eye, exactly what untempered
acid is to the tongue.The mere dogtooth is an _acid_ moulding, and can
only be used in certain mingling with others, to give them piquancy;
never alone.What, then, will be the next easiest method of giving
interest to the fillet?Simply to make the incisions square instead of sharp, and to
leave equal intervals of the square edge between them.is
one of the curved pieces of arch armor, with its edge thus treated; one
side only being done at the bottom, to show the simplicity and ease of
the work.This ornament gives force and interest to the edge of the
arch, without in the least diminishing its quietness.Nothing was ever,
nor could be ever invented, fitter for its purpose, or more easily cut.From the arch it therefore found its way into every position where the
edge of a piece of stone projected, and became, from its constancy of
occurrence in the latest Gothic as well as the earliest Byzantine, most
truly deserving of the name of the "Venetian Dentil."Its complete
intention is now, however, only to be seen in the pictures of Gentile
Bellini and Vittor Carpaccio; for, like most of the rest of the
mouldings of Venetian buildings, it was always either gilded or
painted--often both, gold being laid on the faces of the dentils, and
their recesses  alternately red and blue.Observe, however, that the reason above given for the
_universality_ of this ornament was by no means the reason of its
_invention_.The Venetian dentil is a particular application (consequent
on the incrusted character of Venetian architecture) of the general idea
of dentil, which had been originally given by the Greeks, and realised
both by them and by the Byzantines in many laborious forms, long before
there was need of them for arch armor; and the lower half of Plate IX.will give some idea of the conditions which occur in the Romanesque of
Venice, distinctly derived from the classical dentil; and of the gradual
transition to the more convenient and simple type, the running-hand
dentil, which afterwards became the characteristic of Venetian Gothic.13[76] is the common dentiled cornice, which occurs repeatedly in
St.Mark's; and, as late as the thirteenth century, a reduplication of
it, forming the abaci of the capitals of the Piazzetta shafts.15
is perhaps an earlier type; perhaps only one of more careless
workmanship, from a Byzantine ruin in the Rio di Ca' Foscari: and it is
interesting to compare it with fig.14 from the Cathedral of Vienne, in
South France.Mark's, and 18, from the apse of Murano,
are two very early examples in which the future true Venetian dentil is
already developed in method of execution, though the object is still
only to imitate the classical one; and a rude imitation of the bead is
joined with it in fig.16 indicates two examples of experimental
forms: the uppermost from the tomb of Mastino della Scala, at Verona;
the lower from a door in Venice, I believe, of the thirteenth century:
19 is a more frequent arrangement, chiefly found in cast brick, and
connecting the dentils with the dogteeth: 20 is a form introduced richly
in the later Gothic, but of rare occurrence until the latter half of the
thirteenth century.I shall call it the _gabled_ dentil.It is found in
the greatest profusion in sepulchral Gothic, associated with several
slight variations from the usual dentil type, of which No.21, from the
tomb of Pietro Cornaro, may serve as an example.are of not unfrequent
occurrence: varying much in size and depth, according to the expression of
the work in which they occur; generally increasing in size in late work
(the earliest dentils are seldom more than an inch or an inch and a half
long: the fully developed dentil of the later Gothic is often as much as
four or five in length, by one and a half in breadth); but they are all
somewhat rare, compared to the true or armor dentil, above described.On
the other hand, there are one or two unique conditions, which will be
noted in the buildings where they occur.[77] The Ducal Palace furnishes
three anomalies in the arch, dogtooth, and dentil: it has a hyperbolic
arch, as noted above, Chap.; it has a double-fanged dogtooth
in the rings of the spiral shafts on its angles; and, finally, it has a
dentil with concave sides, of which the section and two of the blocks,
real size, are given in Plate XIV.The labor of obtaining this difficult
profile has, however, been thrown away; for the effect of the dentil at
ten feet distance is exactly the same as that of the usual form: and the
reader may consider the dogtooth and dentil in that plate as fairly
representing the common use of them in the Venetian Gothic.I am aware of no other form of fillet decoration requiring
notice: in the Northern Gothic, the fillet is employed chiefly to give
severity or flatness to mouldings supposed to be too much rounded, and
is therefore generally plain.It is itself an ugly moulding, and, when
thus employed, is merely a foil for others, of which, however, it at
last usurped the place, and became one of the most painful features in
the debased Gothic both of Italy and the North.FOOTNOTES:

  [74] I do not here speak of artistical merits, but the play of the
    light among the lower shafts is also singularly beautiful in this
    sketch of Prout's, and the character of the wild and broken leaves,
    half dead, on the stone of the foreground.[75] Vide the "Seven Lamps," p.[76] The sections of all the mouldings are given on the right of
    each; the part which is constantly solid being shaded, and that
    which is cut into dentils left.[77] As, however, we shall not probably be led either to Bergamo or
    Bologna, I may mention here a curiously rich use of the dentil,
    entirely covering the foliation and tracery of a niche on the
    outside of the duomo of Bergamo; and a roll, entirely incrusted, as
    the handle of a mace often is with nails, with massy dogteeth or
    nail-heads, on the door of the Pepoli palace of Bologna.I. I have classed these two means of architectural effect together,
because the one is in most cases the negative of the other, and is used
to relieve it exactly as shadow relieves light; recess alternating with
roll, not only in lateral, but in successive order; not merely side by
side with each other, but interrupted the one by the other in their own
lines.A recess itself has properly no decoration; but its depth gives
value to the decoration which flanks, encloses, or interrupts it, and
the form which interrupts it best is the roll.I use the word roll generally for any mouldings which present
to the eye somewhat the appearance of being cylindrical, and look like
round rods.When upright, they are in appearance, if not in fact, small
shafts; and are a kind of bent shaft, even when used in archivolts and
traceries;--when horizontal, they confuse themselves with cornices, and
are, in fact, generally to be considered as the best means of drawing an
architectural line in any direction, the soft curve of their side
obtaining some shadow at nearly all times of the day, and that more
tender and grateful to the eye than can be obtained either by an
incision or by any other form of projection.Their decorative power is, however, too slight for rich work,
and they frequently require, like the angle and the fillet, to be rendered
interesting by subdivision or minor ornament of their own.When the roll
is small, this is effected, exactly as in the case of the fillet, by
cutting pieces out of it; giving in the simplest results what is called
the Norman billet moulding: and when the cuts are given in couples, and
the pieces rounded into spheres and almonds, we have the ordinary Greek
bead, both of them too well known to require illustration.The Norman
billet we shall not meet with in Venice; the bead constantly occurs in
Byzantine, and of course in Renaissance work.17,
there is a remarkable example of its early treatment, where the cuts in
it are left sharp.But the roll, if it be of any size, deserves better treatment.Its rounded surface is too beautiful to be cut away in notches; and it
is rather to be covered with flat chasing or inlaid patterns.Thus
ornamented, it gradually blends itself with the true shaft, both in the
Romanesque work of the North, and in the Italian connected schools; and
the patterns used for it are those used for shaft decoration in general.V. But, as alternating with the recess, it has a decoration peculiar
to itself.We have often, in the preceding chapters, noted the fondness
of the Northern builders for deep shade and hollowness in their
mouldings; and in the second chapter of the "Seven Lamps," the changes
are described which reduced the massive roll mouldings of the early
Gothic to a series of recesses, separated by bars of light.The shape of
these recesses is at present a matter of no importance to us: it was,
indeed, endlessly varied; but needlessly, for the value of a recess is
in its darkness, and its darkness disguises its form.But it was not in
mere wanton indulgence of their love of shade that the Flamboyant
builders deepened the furrows of their mouldings: they had found a means
of decorating those furrows as rich as it was expressive, and the entire
frame-work of their architecture was designed with a view to the effect
of this decoration; where the ornament ceases, the frame-work is meagre
and mean: but the ornament is, in the best examples of the style,
unceasing.It is, in fact, an ornament formed by the ghosts or anatomies of
the old shafts, left in the furrows which had taken their place.Every
here and there, a fragment of a roll or shaft is left in the recess or
furrow: a billet-moulding on a huge scale, but a billet-moulding reduced
to a skeleton; for the fragments of roll are cut hollow, and worked into
mere entanglement of stony fibres, with the gloom of the recess shown
through them.These ghost rolls, forming sometimes pedestals, sometimes
canopies, sometimes covering the whole recess with an arch of tracery,
beneath which it runs like a tunnel, are the peculiar decorations of the
Flamboyant Gothic.Now observe, in all kinds of decoration, we must keep carefully
under separate heads, the consideration of the changes wrought in the
mere physical form, and in the intellectual purpose of ornament.The
relations of the canopy to the statue it shelters, are to be considered
altogether distinctly from those of the canopy to the building which it
decorates.In its earliest conditions the canopy is partly confused with
representations of miniature architecture: it is sometimes a small
temple or gateway, sometimes a honorary addition to the pomp of a saint,
a covering to his throne, or to his shrine; and this canopy is often
expressed in bas-relief (as in painting), without much reference to the
great requirements of the building.At other times it is a real
protection to the statue, and is enlarged into a complete pinnacle,
carried on proper shafts, and boldly roofed.But in the late northern
system the canopies are neither expressive nor protective.They are a
kind of stone lace-work, required for the ornamentation of the building,
for which the statues are often little more than an excuse, and of which
the physical character is, as above described, that of ghosts of
departed shafts.There is, of course, much rich tabernacle work which will not
come literally under this head, much which is straggling or flat in its
plan, connecting itself gradually with the ordinary forms of independent
shrines and tombs; but the general idea of all tabernacle work is marked
in the common phrase of a "niche," that is to say a hollow intended for
a statue, and crowned by a canopy; and this niche decoration only
reaches its full development when the Flamboyant hollows are cut
deepest, and when the manner and spirit of sculpture had so much lost
their purity and intensity that it became desirable to draw the eye away
from the statue to its covering, so that at last the canopy became the
more important of the two, and is itself so beautiful that we are often
contented with architecture from which profanity has struck the statues,
if only the canopies are left; and consequently, in our modern
ingenuity, even set up canopies where we have no intention of setting
statues.It is a pity that thus we have no really noble example of the
effect of the statue in the recesses of architecture: for the Flamboyant
recess was not so much a preparation for it as a gulf which swallowed it
up.When statues were most earnestly designed, they were thrust forward
in all kinds of places, often in front of the pillars, as at Amiens,
awkwardly enough, but with manly respect to the purpose of the figures.The Flamboyant hollows yawned at their sides, the statues fell back into
them, and nearly disappeared, and a flash of flame in the shape of a
canopy rose as they expired.X. I do not feel myself capable at present of speaking with perfect
justice of this niche ornament of the north, my late studies in Italy
having somewhat destroyed my sympathies with it.But I once loved it
intensely, and will not say anything to depreciate it now, save only
this, that while I have studied long at Abbeville, without in the least
finding that it made me care less for Verona, I never remained long in
Verona without feeling some doubt of the nobility of Abbeville.Recess decoration by leaf mouldings is constantly and beautifully
associated in the north with niche decoration, but requires no special
notice, the recess in such cases being used merely to give value to the
leafage by its gloom, and the difference between such conditions and
those of the south being merely that in the one the leaves are laid
across a hollow, and in the other over a solid surface; but in neither
of the schools exclusively so, each in some degree intermingling the
method of the other.Finally the recess decoration by the ball flower is very
definite and characteristic, found, I believe, chiefly in English work.It
consists merely in leaving a small boss or sphere, fixed, as it were, at
intervals in the hollows; such bosses being afterwards carved into
roses, or other ornamental forms, and sometimes lifted quite up out of
the hollow, on projecting processes, like vertebrae, so as to make them
more conspicuous, as throughout the decoration of the cathedral of
Bourges.The value of this ornament is chiefly in the _spotted_ character which
it gives to the lines of mouldings seen from a distance.It is very rich
and delightful when not used in excess; but it would satiate and weary
the eye if it were ever used in general architecture.The spire of
Salisbury, and of St.Mary's at Oxford, are agreeable as isolated
masses; but if an entire street were built with this spotty decoration
at every casement, we could not traverse it to the end without disgust.It is only another example of the constant aim at piquancy of effect
which characterised the northern builders; an ingenious but somewhat
vulgar effort to give interest to their grey masses of coarse stone,
without overtaking their powers either of invention or execution.We
will thank them for it without blame or praise, and pass on.I. We know now as much as is needful respecting the methods of minor
and universal decorations, which were distinguished in Chapter XXII., Sec.III., from the ornament which has special relation to particular parts.This local ornament, which, it will be remembered, we arranged in Sec.of the same chapter under five heads, we have next, under those heads,
to consider.And, first, the ornament of the bases, both of walls and
shafts.It was noticed in our account of the divisions of a wall, that there are
something in those divisions like the beginning, the several courses,
and the close of a human life.And as, in all well-conducted lives, the
hard work, and roughing, and gaining of strength come first, the honor
or decoration in certain intervals during their course, but most of all
in their close, so, in general, the base of the wall, which is its
beginning of labor, will bear least decoration, its body more,
especially those epochs of rest called its string courses; but its crown
or cornice most of all.Still, in some buildings, all these are
decorated richly, though the last most; and in others, when the base is
well protected and yet conspicuous, it may probably receive even more
decoration than other parts.Now, the main things to be expressed in a base are its levelness
and evenness.We cannot do better than construct the several members of
the base, as developed in Fig.55, each of a different 
marble, so as to produce marked level bars of color all along the
foundation.This is exquisitely done in all the Italian elaborate wall
bases; that of St.Anastasia at Verona is one of the most perfect
existing, for play of color; that of Giotto's campanile is on the whole
the most beautifully finished.Then, on the vertical portions, _a_, _b_,
_c_, we may put what patterns in mosaic we please, so that they be not
too rich; but if we choose rather to have sculpture (or _must_ have it
for want of stones to inlay), then observe that all sculpture on bases
must be in panels, or it will soon be worn away, and that a plain
panelling is often good without any other ornament.The member _b_,
which in St.Mark's is subordinate, and _c_, which is expanded into a
seat, are both of them decorated with simple but exquisitely-finished
panelling, in red and white or green and white marble; and the member
_e_ is in bases of this kind very valuable, as an expression of a firm
beginning of the substance of the wall itself.This member has been of
no service to us hitherto, and was unnoticed in the chapters on
construction; but it was expressed in the figure of the wall base, on
account of its great value when the foundation is of stone and the wall
of brick (coated or not).In such cases it is always better to add the
course _e_, above the <DW72> of the base, than abruptly to begin the
common masonry of the wall.It is, however, with the member _d_, or Xb, that we are most
seriously concerned; for this being the essential feature of all bases,
and the true preparation for the wall or shaft, it is most necessary
that here, if anywhere, we should have full expression of levelness and
precision; and farther, that, if possible, the eye should not be
suffered to rest on the points of junction of the stones, which would
give an effect of instability.Both these objects are accomplished by
attracting the eye to two rolls, separated by a deep hollow, in the
member _d_ itself.The bold projections of their mouldings entirely
prevent the attention from being drawn to the joints of the masonry, and
besides form a simple but beautifully connected group of bars of shadow,
which express, in their perfect parallelism, the absolute levelness of
the foundation.I need hardly give any perspective drawing of an arrangement
which must be perfectly familiar to the reader, as occurring under nearly
every column of the too numerous classical buildings all over Europe.But I may name the base of the Bank of England as furnishing a very
simple instance of the group, with a square instead of a rounded hollow,
both forming the base of the wall, and gathering into that of the shafts
as they occur; while the bases of the pillars of the facade of the
British Museum are as good examples as the reader can study on a larger
scale.[Illustration: Plate X.
               PROFILES OF BASES.]V. I believe this group of mouldings was first invented by the
Greeks, and it has never been materially improved, as far as its peculiar
purpose is concerned;[78] the classical attempts at its variation being
the ugliest: one, the using a single roll of larger size, as may be seen
in the Duke of York's column, which therefore looks as if it stood on a
large sausage (the Monument has the same base, but more concealed by
pedestal decoration): another, the using two rolls without the
intermediate cavetto,--a condition hardly less awkward, and which may be
studied to advantage in the wall and shaftbases of the Athenaeum
Club-house: and another, the introduction of what are called fillets
between the rolls, as may be seen in the pillars of Hanover Chapel,
Regent Street, which look, in consequence, as if they were standing upon
a pile of pewter collection plates.But the only successful changes have
been mediaeval; and their nature will be at once understood by a glance
at the varieties given on the opposite page.It will be well first to
give the buildings in which they occur, in order.Mark's,     | 15.Northern portico, upper shafts, | 20.Michele, Pavia.| 24.Fondaco de' Turchi, Venice.Fondaco de' Turchi, Venice.Eighteen out of the twenty eight varieties are Venetian,
being bases to which I shall have need of future reference; but the
interspersed examples, 8, 9, 12, and 19, from Milan, Pavia, Vienne
(France), and Verona, show the exactly correspondent conditions of the
Romanesque base at the period, throughout the centre of Europe.The last
five examples show the changes effected by the French Gothic architects:
the Salisbury base (22) I have only introduced to show its dulness and
vulgarity beside them; and 23, from Torcello, for a special reason, in
that place.The reader will observe that the two bases, 8 and 9, from the
two most important Lombardic churches of Italy, St.Michele of Pavia, mark the character of the barbaric base founded on
pure Roman models, sometimes approximating to such models very closely;
and the varieties 10, 11, 13, 16 are Byzantine types, also founded on
Roman models.But in the bases 1 to 7 inclusive, and, still more
characteristically, in 23 below, there is evidently an original element,
a tendency to use the fillet and hollow instead of the roll, which is
eminently Gothic; which in the base 3 reminds one even of Flamboyant
conditions, and is excessively remarkable as occurring in Italian work
certainly not later than the tenth century, taking even the date of the
last rebuilding of the Duomo of Torcello, though I am strongly inclined
to consider these bases portions of the original church.And I have
therefore put the base 23 among the Gothic group to which it has so
strong relationship, though, on the last supposition, five centuries
older than the earliest of the five terminal examples; and it is still
more remarkable because it reverses the usual treatment of the lower
roll, which is in general a tolerably accurate test of the age of a
base, in the degree of its projection.Thus, in the examples 2, 3, 4, 5,
9, 10, 12, the lower roll is hardly rounded at all, and diametrically
opposed to the late Gothic conditions, 24 to 28, in which it advances
gradually, like a wave preparing to break, and at last is actually seen
curling over with the long-backed rush of surf upon the shore.Yet the
Torcello base resembles these Gothic ones both in expansion beneath and
in depth of cavetto above.There can be no question of the ineffable superiority of these
Gothic bases, in grace of profile, to any ever invented by the ancients.But they have all two great faults: They seem, in the first place, to
have been designed without sufficient reference to the necessity of
their being usually seen from above; their grace of profile cannot be
estimated when so seen, and their excessive expansion gives them an
appearance of flatness and separation from the shaft, as if they had
splashed out under its pressure: in the second place their cavetto is so
deeply cut that it has the appearance of a black fissure between the
members of the base; and in the Lyons and Bourges shafts, 24 and 26, it
is impossible to conquer the idea suggested by it, that the two stones
above and below have been intended to join close, but that some pebbles
have got in and kept them from fitting; one is always expecting the
pebbles to be crushed, and the shaft to settle into its place with a
thunder-clap.For these reasons, I said that the profile of the pure classic
base had hardly been materially improved; but the various conditions of
it are beautiful or commonplace, in proportion to the variety of
proportion among their lines and the delicacy of their curvatures; that
is to say, the expression of characters like those of the abstract lines
in Plate VII.The five best profiles in Plate X. are 10, 17, 19, 20, 21; 10 is
peculiarly beautiful in the opposition between the bold projection of
its upper roll, and the delicate leafy curvature of its lower; and this
and 21 may be taken as nearly perfect types, the one of the steep, the
other of the expansive basic profiles.The characters of all, however,
are so dependent upon their place and expression, that it is unfair to
judge them thus separately; and the precision of curvature is a matter
of so small consequence in general effect, that we need not here pursue
the subject farther.X. We have thus far, however, considered only the lines of moulding
in the member X b, whether of wall or shaft base.But the reader will
remember that in our best shaft base, in Fig.78), certain
props or spurs were applied to the <DW72> of X b; but now that X b is
divided into these delicate mouldings, we cannot conveniently apply the
spur to its irregular profile; we must be content to set it against the
lower roll.Let the upper edge of this lower roll be the curved line
here, _a_, _d_, _e_, _b_, Fig.LIX., and _c_ the angle of the square
plinth projecting beneath it.Then the spur, applied as we saw in Chap.VII., will be of some such form as the triangle _c e d_, Fig.Now it has just been stated that it is of small importance
whether the abstract lines of the profile of a base moulding be fine or
not, because we rarely stoop down to look at them.But this triangular
spur is nearly always seen from above, and the eye is drawn to it as one
of the most important features of the whole base; therefore it is a point
of immediate necessity to substitute for its harsh right lines (_c d_,
_c e_) some curve of noble abstract character.I mentioned, in speaking of the line of the salvia leaf at p.224, that I had marked off the portion of it, _x y_, because I thought
it likely to be generally useful to us afterwards; and I promised the
reader that as he had built, so he should decorate his edifice at his
own free will.If, therefore, he likes the above triangular spur, _c d
e_, by all means let him keep it; but if he be on the whole dissatisfied
with it, I may be permitted, perhaps, to advise him to set to work like
a tapestry bee, to cut off the little bit of line of salvia leaf _x y_,
and try how he can best substitute it for the awkward lines _c d c e_.He may try it any way that he likes; but if he puts the salvia curvature
inside the present lines, he will find the spur looks weak, and I think
he will determine at last on placing it as I have done at _c d_, _c e_,
Fig.(If the reader will be at the pains to transfer the salvia leaf
line with tracing paper, he will find it accurately used in this
figure.)Then I merely add an outer circular line to represent the outer
swell of the roll against which the spur is set, and I put another such
spur to the opposite corner of the square, and we have the half base,
Fig.LX., which is a general type of the best Gothic bases in existence,
being very nearly that of the upper shafts of the Ducal Palace of
Venice.In those shafts the quadrant _a b_, or the upper edge of the
lower roll, is 2 feet 1-3/8 inches round, and the base of the spur _d
e_, is 10 inches; the line _d e_ being therefore to _a b_ as 10 to
25-3/8.it is as 10 to 24, the measurement being easier and
the type somewhat more generally representative of the best, _i.e._
broadest, spurs of Italian Gothic.Now, the reader is to remember, there is nothing magical in
salvia leaves: the line I take from them happened merely to fall
conveniently on the page, and might as well have been taken from
anything else; it is simply its character of gradated curvature which
fits it for our use.On Plate XI., opposite, I have given plans of the
spurs and quadrants of twelve Italian and three Northern bases; these
latter (13), from Bourges, (14) from Lyons, (15) from Rouen, are given
merely to show the Northern disposition to break up bounding lines, and
lose breadth in picturesqueness.These Northern bases look the prettiest
in this plate, because this variation of the outline is nearly all the
ornament they have, being cut very rudely; but the Italian bases above
them are merely prepared by their simple outlines for far richer
decoration at the next step, as we shall see presently.The Northern
bases are to be noted also for another grand error: the projection of
the roll beyond the square plinth, of which the corner is seen, in
various degrees of advancement, in the three examples.13 is the base
whose profile is No.26 in Plate X.; 14 is 24 in the same plate; and 15
is 28.The Italian bases are the following; all, except 7 and 10, being
Venetian: 1 and 2, upper colonnade, St.Mark's; 3, Ca' Falier; 4, lower
colonnade, and 5, transept, St.Mark's; 6, from the Church of St.John
and Paul; 7, from the tomb near St.Anastasia, Verona, described above
(p.142); 8 and 9, Fon daco de' Turchi, Venice; 10, tomb of Can Mastino
della Scala, Verona; 11, San Stefano, Venice; 12, Ducal Palace, Venice,
upper colonnade.3, 8, 9, 11 are the bases whose profiles are
respectively Nos.18, 11, 13, and 20 in Plate X. The flat surfaces of
the basic plinths are here shaded; and in the lower corner of the square
occupied by each quadrant is put, also shaded, the central profile of
each spur, from its root at the roll of the base to its point; those of
Nos.1 and 2 being conjectural, for their spurs were so rude and ugly,
that I took no note of their profiles; but they would probably be as
here given.As these bases, though here, for the sake of comparison,
reduced within squares of equal size, in reality belong to shafts of
very different size, 9 being some six or seven inches in diameter,
and 6, three or four feet, the proportionate size of the roll varies
accordingly, being largest, as in 9, where the base is smallest, and in
6 and 12 the leaf profile is given on a larger scale than the plan, or
its character could not have been exhibited.Now, in all these spurs, the reader will observe that the
narrowest are for the most part the earliest.2, from the upper
colonnade of St.Mark's, is the only instance I ever saw of the double
spur, as transitive between the square and octagon plinth; the truncated
form, 1, is also rare and very ugly.3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 are the
general conditions of the Byzantine spur; 8 is a very rare form of plan
in Byzantine work, but proved to be so by its rude level profile; while
7, on the contrary, Byzantine in plan, is eminently Gothic in the
profile.9 to 12 are from formed Gothic buildings, equally refined in
their profile and plan.The character of the profile is indeed much altered by the
accidental nature of the surface decoration; but the importance of the
broad difference between the raised and flat profile will be felt on
glancing at the examples 1 to 6 in Plate XII.The three upper examples
are the Romanesque types, which occur as parallels with the Byzantine
types, 1 to 3 of Plate XI.Their plans would be nearly the same; but
instead of resembling flat leaves, they are literally spurs, or claws,
as high as they are broad; and the third, from St.Michele of Pavia,
appears to be intended to have its resemblance to a claw enforced by the
transverse fillet.Ambrogio, Milan; 2 from Vienne, France.The 4th type, Plate XII., almost like the extremity of a man's foot, is
a Byzantine form (perhaps worn on the edges), from the nave of St.Mark's; and the two next show the unity of the two principles, forming
the perfect Italian Gothic types,--5, from tomb of Can Signorio della
Scala, Verona; 6, from San Stefano, Venice (the base 11 of Plate XI., in
perspective).The two other bases, 10 and 12 of Plate XI., are
conditions of the same kind, showing the varieties of rise and fall in
exquisite modulation; the 10th, a type more frequent at Verona than
Venice, in which the spur profile overlaps the roll, instead of rising
out of it, and seems to hold it down, as if it were a ring held by
sockets.This is a character found both in early and late work; a kind
of band, or fillet, appears to hold, and even compress, the _centre_ of
the roll in the base of one of the crypt shafts of St.Peter's, Oxford,
which has also spurs at its angles; and long bands flow over the base of
the angle shaft of the Ducal Palace of Venice, next the Porta della
Carta.When the main contours of the base are once determined, its
decoration is as easy as it is infinite.I have merely given, in Plate
XII., three examples to which I shall need to refer, hereafter.9 is
a very early and curious one; the decoration of the base 6 in Plate XI.,
representing a leaf turned over and flattened down; or, rather, the idea
of the turned leaf, worked as well as could be imagined on the flat
contour of the spur.Then 10 is the perfect, but simplest possible
development of the same idea, from the earliest bases of the upper
colonnade of the Ducal Palace, that is to say, the bases of the sea
facade; and 7 and 8 are its lateral profile and transverse section.Finally, 11 and 12 are two of the spurs of the later shafts of the same
colonnade on the Piazzetta side (No.11 occurs on
one of these shafts only, and is singularly beautiful.I suspect it to
be earlier than the other, which is the characteristic base of the rest
of the series, and already shows the loose, sensual, ungoverned
character of fifteenth century ornament in the dissoluteness of its
rolling.I merely give these as examples ready to my hand, and
necessary for future reference; not as in anywise representative of the
variety of the Italian treatment of the general contour, far less of the
endless caprices of the North.The most beautiful base I ever saw, on the
whole, is a Byzantine one in the Baptistery of St.Mark's, in which the
spur profile approximates to that of No.; but it is formed
by a cherub, who sweeps downwards on the wing.His two wings, as they half
close, form the upper part of the spur, and the rise of it in the front
is formed by exactly the action of Alichino, swooping on the pitch lake:
"quei drizzo, volando, suso il petto."But it requires noble management
to confine such a fancy within such limits.The greater number of the
best bases are formed of leaves; and the reader may amuse himself as he
will by endless inventions of them, from types which he may gather among
the weeds at the nearest roadside.The value of the vegetable form is
especially here, as above noted, Chap.XXXII., its capability
of unity with the mass of the base, and of being suggested by few lines;
none but the Northern Gothic architects are able to introduce entire
animal forms in this position with perfect success.There is a beautiful
instance at the north door of the west front of Rouen; a lizard pausing
and curling himself round a little in the angle; one expects him the
next instant to lash round the shaft and vanish: and we may with
advantage compare this base with those of Renaissance Scuola di San
Rocca[79] at Venice, in which the architect, imitating the mediaeval
bases, which he did not understand, has put an elephant, four inches
higher, in the same position.I have not in this chapter spoken at all of the profiles which
are given in Northern architecture to the projections of the lower
members of the base, _b_ and _c_ in Fig.II., nor of the methods in
which both these, and the rolls of the mouldings in Plate X., are
decorated, especially in Roman architecture, with superadded chain work
or chasing of various patterns.Of the first I have not spoken, because
I shall have no occasion to allude to them in the following essay; nor
of the second, because I consider them barbarisms.Decorated rolls and
decorated ogee profiles, such, for instance, as the base of the Arc de
l'Etoile at Paris, are among the richest and farthest refinements of
decorative appliances; and they ought always to be reserved for jambs,
cornices, and archivolts: if you begin with them in the base, you have
no power of refining your decorations as you ascend, and, which is still
worse, you put your most delicate work on the jutting portions of the
foundation,--the very portions which are most exposed to abrasion.The
best expression of a base is that of stern endurance,--the look of being
able to bear roughing; or, if the whole building is so delicate that no
one can be expected to treat even its base with unkindness,[80] then at
least the expression of quiet, prefatory simplicity.The angle spur may
receive such decoration as we have seen, because it is one of the most
important features in the whole building; and the eye is always so
attracted to it that it cannot be in rich architecture left altogether
blank; the eye is stayed upon it by its position, but glides, and ought
to glide, along the basic rolls to take measurement of their length: and
even with all this added fitness, the ornament of the basic spur is
best, in the long run, when it is boldest and simplest.XVIII., as the most beautiful I ever saw, was not for that
reason the best I ever saw: beautiful in its place, in a quiet corner of
a Baptistery sheeted with jasper and alabaster, it would have been
utterly wrong, nay, even offensive, if used in sterner work, or repeated
along a whole colonnade.is the richest
with which I was ever perfectly satisfied for general service; and the
basic spurs of the building which I have named as the best Gothic
monument in the world (p.The
adaptation, therefore, of rich cornice and roll mouldings to the level
and ordinary lines of bases, whether of walls or shafts, I hold to be
one of the worst barbarisms which the Roman and Renaissance architects
ever committed; and that nothing can afterwards redeem the effeminacy
and vulgarity of the buildings in which it prominently takes place.I have also passed over, without present notice, the fantastic
bases formed by couchant animals, which sustain many Lombardic shafts.The pillars they support have independent bases of the ordinary kind;
and the animal form beneath is less to be considered as a true base
(though often exquisitely combined with it, as in the shaft on the
south-west angle of the cathedral of Genoa) than as a piece of
sculpture, otherwise necessary to the nobility of the building, and
deriving its value from its special positive fulfilment of expressional
purposes, with which we have here no concern.As the embodiment of a
wild superstition, and the representation of supernatural powers, their
appeal to the imagination sets at utter defiance all judgment based on
ordinary canons of law; and the magnificence of their treatment atones,
in nearly every case, for the extravagance of their conception.I should
not admit this appeal to the imagination, if it had been made by a
nation in whom the powers of body and mind had been languid; but by the
Lombard, strong in all the realities of human life, we need not fear
being led astray: the visions of a distempered fancy are not indeed
permitted to replace the truth, or set aside the laws of science: but
the imagination which is thoroughly under the command of the intelligent
will,[81] has a dominion indiscernible by science, and illimitable by
law; and we may acknowledge the authority of the Lombardic gryphons in
the mere splendor of their presence, without thinking idolatry an excuse
for mechanical misconstruction, or dreading to be called upon, in other
cases, to admire a systemless architecture, because it may happen to
have sprung from an irrational religion.FOOTNOTES:

  [78] Another most important reason for the peculiar sufficiency and
    value of this base, especially as opposed to the bulging forms of
    the single or double roll, without the cavetto, has been suggested
    by the writer of the Essay on the Aesthetics of Gothic Architecture
    in the British Quarterly for August, 1849:--"The Attic base
    _recedes_ at the point where, if it suffered from superincumbent
    weight, it would bulge out."[79] I have put in Appendix 24, "Renaissance Bases," my memorandum
    written respecting this building on the spot.But the reader had
    better delay referring to it, until we have completed our
    examination of ornaments in shafts and capitals.[80] Appendix 25, "Romanist Decoration of Bases."[81] In all the wildness of the Lombardic fancy (described in
    Appendix 8), this command of the will over its action is as distinct
    as it is stern.The fancy is, in the early work of the nation,
    visibly diseased; but never the will, nor the reason.THE WALL VEIL AND SHAFT.I. No subject has been more open ground of dispute among architects
than the decoration of the wall veil, because no decoration appeared
naturally to grow out of its construction; nor could any curvatures be
given to its surface large enough to produce much impression on the eye.It has become, therefore, a kind of general field for experiments of
various effects of surface ornament, or has been altogether abandoned to
the mosaicist and fresco painter.But we may perhaps conclude, from what
was advanced in the Fifth Chapter, that there is one kind of decoration
which will, indeed, naturally follow on its construction.For it is
perfectly natural that the different kinds of stone used in its
successive courses should be of different colors; and there are many
associations and analogies which metaphysically justify the introduction
of horizontal bands of color, or of light and shade.They are, in the
first place, a kind of expression of the growth or age of the wall, like
the rings in the wood of a tree; then they are a farther symbol of the
alternation of light and darkness, which was above noted as the source
of the charm of many inferior mouldings: again, they are valuable as an
expression of horizontal space to the imagination, space of which the
conception is opposed, and gives more effect by its opposition, to the
enclosing power of the wall itself (this I spoke of as probably the
great charm of these horizontal bars to the Arabian mind): and again
they are valuable in their suggestion of the natural courses of rocks,
and beds of the earth itself.And to all these powerful imaginative
reasons we have to add the merely ocular charm of interlineal opposition
of color; a charm so great, that all the best colorists, without a
single exception, depend upon it for the most piquant of their pictorial
effects, some vigorous mass of alternate stripes or bars of color being
made central in all their richest arrangements.The whole system of
Tintoret's great picture of the Miracle of St.Mark is poised on the
bars of blue, which cross the white turban of the executioner.There are, therefore, no ornaments more deeply suggestive in
their simplicity than these alternate bars of horizontal colors; nor do
I know any buildings more noble than those of the Pisan Romanesque, in
which they are habitually employed; and certainly none so graceful, so
attractive, so enduringly delightful in their nobleness.Yet, of this
pure and graceful ornamentation, Professor Willis says, "a practice more
destructive of architectural grandeur can hardly be conceived:" and
modern architects have substituted for it the ingenious ornament of
which the reader has had one specimen above, Fig.61, and with
which half the large buildings in London are disfigured, or else
traversed by mere straight lines, as, for instance, the back of the
Bank.The lines on the Bank may, perhaps, be considered typical of
accounts; but in general the walls, if left destitute of them, would
have been as much fairer than the walls charged with them, as a sheet of
white paper is than the leaf of a ledger.But that the reader may have
free liberty of judgment in this matter, I place two examples of the old
and the Renaissance ornament side by side on the opposite page.That on
the right is Romanesque, from St.Pietro of Pistoja; that on the left,
modern English, from the Arthur Club-house, St.But why, it will be asked, should the lines which mark the
division of the stones be wrong when they are chiselled, and right when
they are marked by color?First, because the color separation is a
natural one.You build with different kinds of stone, of which,
probably, one is more costly than another; which latter, as you cannot
construct your building of it entirely, you arrange in conspicuous bars.But the chiselling of the stones is a wilful throwing away of time and
labor in defacing the building: it costs much to hew one of those
monstrous blocks into shape; and, when it is done, the building is
_weaker_ than it was before, by just as much stone as has been cut away
from its joints.And, secondly, because, as I have repeatedly urged,
straight lines are ugly things as _lines_, but admirable as limits of
 spaces; and the joints of the stones, which are painful in
proportion to their regularity, if drawn as lines, are perfectly
agreeable when marked by variations of hue.What is true of the divisions of stone by chiselling, is equally
true of divisions of bricks by pointing.Nor, of course, is the mere
horizontal bar the only arrangement in which the colors of brickwork or
masonry can be gracefully disposed.It is rather one which can only be
employed with advantage when the courses of stone are deep and bold.When the masonry is small, it is better to throw its colors into
chequered patterns.We shall have several interesting examples to study
in Venice besides the well-known one of the Ducal Palace.The town of
Moulins, in France, is one of the most remarkable on this side the Alps
for its chequered patterns in bricks.The church of Christchurch,
Streatham, lately built, though spoiled by many grievous errors (the
iron work in the campanile being the grossest), yet affords the
inhabitants of the district a means of obtaining some idea of the
variety of effects which are possible with no other material than brick.V. We have yet to notice another effort of the Renaissance architects
to adorn the blank spaces of their walls by what is called Rustication.There is sometimes an obscure trace of the remains of the imitation of
something organic in this kind of work.In some of the better French
eighteenth century buildings it has a distinctly floral character, like
a final degradation of Flamboyant leafage; and some of our modern
English architects appear to have taken the decayed teeth of elephants
for their type; but, for the most part, it resembles nothing so much as
worm casts; nor these with any precision.If it did, it would not bring
it within the sphere of our properly imitative ornamentation.I thought
it unnecessary to warn the reader that he was not to copy forms of
refuse or corruption; and that, while he might legitimately take the
worm or the reptile for a subject of imitation, he was not to study the
worm cast or coprolite.It is, however, I believe, sometimes supposed that rustication
gives an appearance of solidity to foundation stones.Not so; at least
to any one who knows the look of a hard stone.You may, by rustication,
make your good marble or granite look like wet slime, honeycombed by
sand-eels, or like half-baked tufo covered with slow exudation of
stalactite, or like rotten claystone coated with concretions of its own
mud; but not like the stones of which the hard world is built.Do not
think that nature rusticates her foundations.Smooth sheets of rock,
glistening like sea waves, and that ring under the hammer like a brazen
bell,--that is her preparation for first stories.She does rusticate
sometimes: crumbly sand-stones, with their ripple-marks filled with red
mud; dusty lime-stones, which the rains wash into labyrinthine cavities;
spongy lavas, which the volcano blast drags hither and thither into ropy
coils and bubbling hollows;--these she rusticates, indeed, when she
wants to make oyster-shells and magnesia of them; but not when she needs
to lay foundations with them.Then she seeks the polished surface and
iron heart, not rough looks and incoherent substance.Of the richer modes of wall decoration it is impossible to
institute any general comparison; they are quite infinite, from mere
inlaid geometrical figures up to incrustations of elaborate bas-relief.The architect has perhaps more license in them, and more power of
producing good effect with rude design than in any other features of the
building; the chequer and hatchet work of the Normans and the rude
bas-reliefs of the Lombards being almost as satisfactory as the delicate
panelling and mosaic of the Duomo of Florence.But this is to be noted
of all good wall ornament, that it retains the expression of firm and
massive substance, and of broad surface, and that architecture instantly
declined when linear design was substituted for massive, and the sense
of weight of wall was lost in a wilderness of upright or undulating
rods.Of the richest and most delicate wall veil decoration by inlaid
work, as practised in Italy from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, I
have given the reader two characteristic examples in Plates XX.There are, however, three spaces in which the wall veil,
peculiarly limited in shape, was always felt to be fitted for surface
decoration of the most elaborate kind; and in these spaces are found the
most majestic instances of its treatment, even to late periods.One of
these is the spandril space, or the filling between any two arches,
commonly of the shape _a_, Fig.; the half of which, or the flank
filling of any arch, is called a spandril.In Chapter XVII., on Filling
of Apertures, the reader will find another of these spaces noted, called
the tympanum, and commonly of the form _b_, Fig.: and finally, in
Chapter XVIII., he will find the third space described, that between an
arch and its protecting gable, approximating generally to the form _c_,
Fig.The methods of treating these spaces might alone furnish subject
for three very interesting essays; but I shall only note the most
essential points respecting them.It was observed in Chapter XII., that this portion of
the arch load might frequently be lightened with great advantage by
piercing it with a circle, or with a group of circles; and the roof of
the Euston Square railroad station was adduced as an example.One of the
spandril decorations of Bayeux Cathedral is given in the "Seven Lamps,"
Plate VII.It is little more than one of these Euston Square
spandrils, with its circles foliated.SPANDRIL DECORATION
               THE DUCAL PALACE.]Sometimes the circle is entirely pierced; at other times it is merely
suggested by a mosaic or light tracery on the wall surface, as in the
plate opposite, which is one of the spandrils of the Ducal Palace at
Venice.It was evidently intended that all the spandrils of this
building should be decorated in this manner, but only two of them seem
to have been completed.X. The other modes of spandril filling may be broadly reduced to four
heads.Free figure sculpture, as in the Chapter-house of Salisbury,
and very superbly along the west front of Bourges, the best Gothic
spandrils I know.Radiated foliage, more or less referred to the
centre, or to the bottom of the spandril for its origin; single figures
with expanded wings often answering the same purpose.Trefoils; and
4, ordinary wall decoration continued into the spandril space, as in
Plate XIII., above, from St.Pietro at Pistoja, and in Westminster
Abbey.The Renaissance architects introduced spandril fillings composed
of colossal human figures reclining on the sides of the arch, in
precarious lassitude; but these cannot come under the head of wall veil
decoration.It was noted that, in Gothic architecture,
this is for the most part a detached slab of stone, having no
constructional relation to the rest of the building.The plan of its
sculpture is therefore quite arbitrary; and, as it is generally in a
conspicuous position, near the eye, and above the entrance, it is almost
always charged with a series of rich figure sculptures, solemn in feeling
and consecutive in subject.It occupies in Christian sacred edifices very
nearly the position of the pediment in Greek sculpture.This latter is
itself a kind of tympanum, and charged with sculpture in the same
manner.The same principles apply to it which have been
noted respecting the spandril, with one more of some importance.The
chief difficulty in treating a gable lies in the excessive sharpness of
its upper point.It may, indeed, on its outside apex, receive a finial;
but the meeting of the inside lines of its terminal mouldings is
necessarily both harsh and conspicuous, unless artificially concealed.The most beautiful victory I have ever seen obtained over this
difficulty was by placing a sharp shield, its point, as usual,
downwards, at the apex of the gable, which exactly reversed the
offensive lines, yet without actually breaking them; the gable being
completed behind the shield.The same thing is done in the Northern and
Southern Gothic: in the porches of Abbeville and the tombs of Verona.I believe there is little else to be noted of general laws
of ornament respecting the wall veil.We have next to consider its
concentration in the shaft.Now the principal beauty of a shaft is its perfect proportion to its
work,--its exact expression of necessary strength.If this has been
truly attained, it will hardly need, in some cases hardly bear, more
decoration than is given to it by its own rounding and taper curvatures;
for, if we cut ornaments in intaglio on its surface, we weaken it; if we
leave them in relief, we overcharge it, and the sweep of the line from
its base to its summit, though deduced in Chapter VIII., from
necessities of construction, is already one of gradated curvature, and
of high decorative value.It is, however, carefully to be noted, that decorations are
admissible on colossal and on diminutive shafts, which are wrong upon
those of middle size.For, when the shaft is enormous, incisions or
sculpture on its sides (unless colossal also), do not materially
interfere with the sweep of its curve, nor diminish the efficiency of
its sustaining mass.And if it be diminutive, its sustaining function is
comparatively of so small importance, the injurious results of failure
so much less, and the relative strength and cohesion of its mass so much
greater, that it may be suffered in the extravagance of ornament or
outline which would be unendurable in a shaft of middle size, and
impossible in one of colossal.Thus, the shafts drawn in Plate XIII., of
the "Seven Lamps," though given as examples of extravagance, are yet
pleasing in the general effect of the arcade they support; being each
some six or seven feet high.But they would have been monstrous, as
well as unsafe, if they had been sixty or seventy.Therefore, to determine the general rule for shaft decoration,
we must ascertain the proportions representative of the mean bulk of
shafts: they might easily be calculated from a sufficient number of
examples, but it may perhaps be assumed, for our present general
purpose, that the mean standard would be of some twenty feet in height,
by eight or nine in circumference: then this will be the size on which
decoration is most difficult and dangerous: and shafts become more and
more fit subjects for decoration, as they rise farther above, or fall
farther beneath it, until very small and very vast shafts will both be
found to look blank unless they receive some chasing or imagery; blank,
whether they support a chair or table on the one side, or sustain a
village on the ridge of an Egyptian architrave on the other.Of the various ornamentation of colossal shafts, there are no
examples so noble as the Egyptian; these the reader can study in Mr.Roberts' work on Egypt nearly as well, I imagine, as if he were beneath
their shadow, one of their chief merits, as examples of method, being
the perfect decision and visibility of their designs at the necessary
distance: contrast with these the incrustations of bas-relief on the
Trajan pillar, much interfering with the smooth lines of the shaft, and
yet themselves untraceable, if not invisible.On shafts of middle size, the only ornament which has ever been
accepted as right, is the Doric fluting, which, indeed, gave the effect
of a succession of unequal lines of shade, but lost much of the repose
of the cylindrical gradation.The Corinthian fluting, which is a mean
multiplication and deepening of the Doric, with a square instead of a
sharp ridge between each hollow, destroyed the serenity of the shaft
altogether, and is always rigid and meagre.Both are, in fact, wrong in
principle; they are an elaborate weakening[83] of the shaft, exactly
opposed (as above shown) to the ribbed form, which is the result of a
group of shafts bound together, and which is especially beautiful when
special service is given to each member.On shafts of inferior size, every species of decoration may be
wisely lavished, and in any quantity, so only that the form of the shaft
be clearly visible.This I hold to be absolutely essential, and that
barbarism begins wherever the sculpture is either so bossy, or so deeply
cut, as to break the contour of the shaft, or compromise its solidity.(Appendix 8), the richly sculptured shaft of the
lower story has lost its dignity and definite function, and become a
shapeless mass, injurious to the symmetry of the building, though of
some value as adding to its imaginative and fantastic character.Had all
the shafts been like it, the facade would have been entirely spoiled;
the inlaid pattern, on the contrary, which is used on the shortest shaft
of the upper story, adds to its preciousness without interfering with
its purpose, and is every way delightful, as are all the inlaid shaft
ornaments of this noble church (another example of them is given in
Plate XII.The same rule would condemn the
Caryatid; which I entirely agree with Mr.Fergusson in thinking (both
for this and other reasons) one of the chief errors of the Greek
schools; and, more decisively still, the Renaissance inventions of shaft
ornament, almost too absurd and too monstrous to be seriously noticed,
which consist in leaving square blocks between the cylinder joints, as
in the portico of No.1, Regent Street, and many other buildings in
London; or in rusticating portions of the shafts, or wrapping fleeces
about them, as at the entrance of Burlington House, in Piccadilly; or
tying drapery round them in knots, as in the new buildings above noticed
(Chap.But, within the limits thus defined,
there is no feature capable of richer decoration than the shaft; the
most beautiful examples of all I have seen, are the slender pillars,
encrusted with arabesques, which flank the portals of the Baptistery and
Duomo at Pisa, and some others of the Pisan and Lucchese churches; but
the varieties of sculpture and inlaying, with which the small
Romanesque shafts, whether Italian or Northern, are adorned when they
occupy important positions, are quite endless, and nearly all admirable.Digby Wyatt has given a beautiful example of inlaid work so
employed, from the cloisters of the Lateran, in his work on early
mosaic; an example which unites the surface decoration of the shaft with
the adoption of the spiral contour.This latter is often all the
decoration which is needed, and none can be more beautiful; it has been
spoken against, like many other good and lovely things, because it has
been too often used in extravagant degrees, like the well-known twisting
of the pillars in Raffaelle's "Beautiful gate."But that extravagant
condition was a Renaissance barbarism: the old Romanesque builders kept
their spirals slight and pure; often, as in the example from St.below, giving only half a turn from the base of the shaft
to its head, and nearly always observing what I hold to be an imperative
law, that no twisted shaft shall be single, but composed of at least two
distinct members, twined with each other.I suppose they followed their
own right feeling in doing this, and had never studied natural shafts;
but the type they _might_ have followed was caught by one of the few
great painters who were not affected by the evil influence of the
fifteenth century, Benozzo Gozzoli, who, in the frescoes of the Ricardi
Palace, among stems of trees for the most part as vertical as stone
shafts, has suddenly introduced one of the shape given in Fig.Many forest trees present, in their accidental contortions, types of
most complicated spiral shafts, the plan being originally of a grouped
shaft rising from several roots; nor, indeed, will the reader ever find
models for every kind of shaft decoration, so graceful or so gorgeous,
as he will find in the great forest aisle, where the strength of the
earth itself seems to rise from the roots into the vaulting; but the
shaft surface, barred as it expands with rings of ebony and silver, is
fretted with traceries of ivy, marbled with purple moss, veined with
grey lichen, and tesselated, by the rays of the rolling heaven, with
flitting fancies of blue shadow and burning gold.FOOTNOTES:

  [82] Vide end of Appendix 20.[83] Vide, however, their defence in the Essay above quoted, p.I. There are no features to which the attention of architects has
been more laboriously directed, in all ages, than these crowning members
of the wall and shaft; and it would be vain to endeavor, within any
moderate limits, to give the reader any idea of the various kinds of
admirable decoration which have been invented for them.But, in
proportion to the effort and straining of the fancy, have been the
extravagances into which it has occasionally fallen; and while it is
utterly impossible severally to enumerate the instances either of its
success or its error, it is very possible to note the limits of the one
and the causes of the other.This is all that we shall attempt in the
present chapter, tracing first for ourselves, as in previous instances,
the natural channels by which invention is here to be directed or
confined, and afterwards remarking the places where, in real practice,
it has broken bounds.The reader remembers, I hope, the main points respecting the
cornice and capital, established above in the Chapters on Construction.Of these I must, however, recapitulate thus much:--

1.That both the cornice and capital are, with reference to the _slope_
of their profile or bell, to be divided into two great orders; in one of
which the ornament is convex, and in the other concave.That the capital, with reference to the method of twisting the
cornice round to construct it, and to unite the circular shaft with the
square abacus, falls into five general forms, represented in Fig.That the most elaborate capitals were formed by true or simple
capitals with a common cornice added above their abacus.We have then, in considering decoration, first to observe the treatment
of the two great orders of the cornice; then their gathering into the
five of the capital; then the addition of the secondary cornice to the
capital when formed.The two great orders or families of cornice were above
distinguished in Fig.69.; and it was mentioned in the same place
that a third family arose from their combination.We must deal with the
two great opposed groups first.V. by circular curves drawn on opposite
sides of the same line.But we now know that in these smaller features
the circle is usually the least interesting curve that we can use; and
that it will be well, since the capital and cornice are both active in
their expression, to use some of the more abstract natural lines.We
will go back, therefore, to our old friend the salvia leaf; and taking
the same piece of it we had before, _x y_, Plate VII., we will apply it
to the cornice line; first within it, giving the concave cornice, then
without, giving the convex cornice.In all the figures, _a_, _b_, _c_,
_d_, Plate XV., the dotted line is at the same <DW72>, and represents an
average profile of the root of cornices (_a_, Fig.69); the curve
of the salvia leaf is applied to it in each case, first with its
roundest curvature up, then with its roundest curvature down; and we
have thus the two varieties, _a_ and _b_, of the concave family, and _c_
and _d_, of the convex family.These four profiles will represent all the simple cornices in
the world; represent them, I mean, as central types: for in any of the
profiles an infinite number of <DW72>s may be given to the dotted line of
the root (which in these four figures is always at the same angle); and
on each of these innumerable <DW72>s an innumerable variety of curves may
be fitted, from every leaf in the forest, and every shell on the shore,
and every movement of the human fingers and fancy; therefore, if the
reader wishes to obtain something like a numerical representation of the
number of possible and beautiful cornices which may be based upon these
four types or roots, and among which the architect has leave to
choose according to the circumstances of his building and the method of
its composition, let him set down a figure 1 to begin with, and write
ciphers after it as fast as he can, without stopping, for an hour.V. None of the types are, however, found in perfection of curvature,
except in the best work.Very often cornices are worked with circular
segments (with a noble, massive effect, for instance, in St.Michele of
Lucca), or with rude approximation to finer curvature, especially _a_,
Plate XV., which occurs often so small as to render it useless to take
much pains upon its curve.It occurs perfectly pure in the condition
represented by 1 of the series 1-6, in Plate XV., on many of the
Byzantine and early Gothic buildings of Venice; in more developed form
it becomes the profile of the bell of the capital in the later Venetian
Gothic, and in much of the best Northern Gothic.It also represents the
Corinthian capital, in which the curvature is taken from the bell to be
added in some excess to the nodding leaves.It is the most graceful of
all simple profiles of cornice and capital._b_ is a much rarer and less manageable type: for this evident
reason, that while _a_ is the natural condition of a line rooted and
strong beneath, but bent out by superincumbent weight, or nodding over
in freedom, _b_ is yielding at the base and rigid at the summit.It has,
however, some exquisite uses, especially in combination, as the reader
may see by glancing in advance at the inner line of the profile 14 in
Plate XV._c_ is the leading convex or Doric type, as _a_ is the leading
concave or Corinthian.Its relation to the best Greek Doric is exactly
what the relation of _a_ is to the Corinthian; that is to say, the
curvature must be taken from the straighter limb of the curve and added
to the bolder bend, giving it a sudden turn inwards (as in the
Corinthian a nod outwards), as the reader may see in the capital of the
Parthenon in the British Museum, where the lower limb of the curve is
_all but_ a right line.[84] But these Doric and Corinthian lines are
mere varieties of the great families which are represented by the
central lines _a_ and _c_, including not only the Doric capital, but all
the small cornices formed by a slight increase of the curve of _c_,
which are of so frequent occurrence in Greek ornaments._d_ is the Christian Doric, which I said (Chap.was invented to replace the antique: it is the representative of the great
Byzantine and Norman families of convex cornice and capital, and, next
to the profile _a_, the most important of the four, being the best
profile for the convex capital, as _a_ is for the concave; _a_ being the
best expression of an elastic line inserted vertically in the shaft, and
_d_ of an elastic line inserted horizontally and rising to meet vertical
pressure.If the reader will glance at the arrangements of boughs of trees, he
will find them commonly dividing into these two families, _a_ and _d_:
they rise out of the trunk and nod from it as _a_, or they spring with
sudden curvature out from it, and rise into sympathy with it, as at _d_;
but they only accidentally display tendencies to the lines _b_ or _c_.Boughs which fall as they spring from the tree also describe the curve
_d_ in the plurality of instances, but reversed in arrangement; their
junction with the stem being at the top of it, their sprays bending out
into rounder curvature.These then being the two primal groups, we have next to note the
combined group, formed by the concave and convex lines joined in various
proportions of curvature, so as to form together the reversed or ogee
curve, represented in one of its most beautiful states by the glacier
line _a_, on Plate VII.I would rather have taken this line than any
other to have formed my third group of cornices by, but as it is too
large, and almost too delicate, we will take instead that of the
Matterhorn side, _e f_, Plate VII.For uniformity's sake I keep the
<DW72> of the dotted line the same as in the primal forms; and applying
this Matterhorn curve in its four relative positions to that line, I
have the types of the four cornices or capitals of the third family,
_e_, _f_, _g_, _h_, on Plate XV.These are, however, general types only thus far, that their line is
composed of one short and one long curve, and that they represent the
four conditions of treatment of every such line; namely, the longest
curve concave in _e_ and _f_, and convex in _g_ and _h_; and the point
of contrary flexure set high in _e_ and _g_, and low in _f_ and _h_.The
relative depth of the arcs, or nature of their curvature, cannot be
taken into consideration without a complexity of system which my space
does not admit.Of the four types thus constituted, _e_ and _f_ are of great importance;
the other two are rarely used, having an appearance of weakness in
consequence of the shortest curve being concave: the profiles _e_ and
_f_, when used for cornices, have usually a fuller sweep and somewhat
greater equality between the branches of the curve; but those here given
are better representatives of the structure applicable to capitals and
cornices indifferently.X. Very often, in the farther treatment of the profiles _e_ or _f_,
another limb is added to their curve in order to join it to the upper or
lower members of the cornice or capital.I do not consider this addition
as forming another family of cornices, because the leading and effective
part of the curve is in these, as in the others, the single ogee; and
the added bend is merely a less abrupt termination of it above or below:
still this group is of so great importance in the richer kinds of
ornamentation that we must have it sufficiently represented.We shall
obtain a type of it by merely continuing the line of the Matterhorn
side, of which before we took only a fragment.The entire line _e_ to
_g_ on Plate VII., is evidently composed of three curves of unequal
lengths, which if we call the shortest 1, the intermediate one 2, and
the longest 3, are there arranged in the order 1, 3, 2, counting
upwards.But evidently we might also have had the arrangements 1, 2, 3,
and 2, 1, 3, giving us three distinct lines, altogether independent of
position, which being applied to one general dotted <DW72> will each give
four cornices, or twelve altogether.Of these the six most important are
those which have the shortest curve convex: they are given in light
relief from _k_ to _p_, Plate XV., and, by turning the page upside down,
the other six will be seen in dark relief, only the little upright bits
of shadow at the bottom are not to be considered as parts of them, being
only admitted in order to give the complete profile of the more
important cornices in light.In these types, as in _e_ and _f_, the only general condition is,
that their line shall be composed of three curves of different lengths
and different arrangements (the depth of arcs and radius of curvatures
being unconsidered).They are arranged in three couples, each couple
being two positions of the same entire line; so that numbering the
component curves in order of magnitude and counting upwards, they will
read--

  _k_ 1, 2, 3,
  _l_ 3, 2, 1,
  _m_ 1, 3, 2,
  _n_ 2, 3, 1,
  _o_ 2, 1, 3,
  _p_ 3, 1, 2._m_ and _n_, which are the _Matterhorn line_, are the most beautiful and
important of all the twelve; _k_ and _l_ the next; _o_ and _p_ are used
only for certain conditions of flower carving on the surface.The
reverses (dark) of _k_ and _l_ are also of considerable service; the
other four hardly ever used in good work.If we were to add a fourth curve to the component series, we
should have forty-eight more cornices: but there is no use in pursuing
the system further, as such arrangements are very rare and easily
resolved into the simpler types with certain arbitrary additions fitted
to their special place; and, in most cases, distinctly separate from the
main curve, as in the inner line of No.14, which is a form of the type
_e_, the longest curve, _i.e._, the lowest, having deepest curvature,
and each limb opposed by a short contrary curve at its extremities, the
convex limb by a concave, the concave by a convex.Such, then, are the great families of profile lines into
which all cornices and capitals may be divided; but their best examples
unite two such profiles in a mode which we cannot understand till we
consider the further ornament with which the profiles are charged.And
in doing this we must, for the sake of clearness, consider, first the
nature of the designs themselves, and next the mode of cutting them.In Plate XVI., opposite, I have thrown together a few of the
most characteristic mediaeval examples of the treatment of the simplest
cornice profiles: the uppermost, _a_, is the pure root of cornices from
St.The second, _d_, is the Christian Doric cornice, here
lettered _d_ in order to avoid confusion, its profile being _d_ of Plate
XV.in bold development, and here seen on the left-hand side, truly
drawn, though filled up with the ornament to show the mode in which the
angle is turned.The third, _b_, is _b_ of
Plate XV., the pattern being inlaid in black because its office was in
the interior of St.Mark's, where it was too dark to see sculptured
ornament at the required distance.(The other two simple profiles, _a_
and _c_ of Plate XV., would be decorated in the same manner, but require
no example here, for the profile _a_ is of so frequent occurrence that
it will have a page to itself alone in the next volume; and c may be
seen over nearly every shop in London, being that of the common Greek
egg cornice.)The fourth, _e_ in Plate XVI., is a transitional cornice,
passing from Byzantine into Venetian Gothic: _f_ is a fully developed
Venetian Gothic cornice founded on Byzantine traditions; and _g_ the
perfect Lombardic-Gothic cornice, founded on the Pisan Romanesque
traditions, and strongly marked with the noblest Northern element, the
Lombardic vitality restrained by classical models.I consider it a
perfect cornice, and of the highest order.Now in the design of this series of ornaments there are two main
points to be noted; the first, that they all, except _b_, are distinctly
rooted in the lower part of the cornice, and spring to the top.This
arrangement is constant in all the best cornices and capitals; and it is
essential to the expression of the supporting power of both.It is
exactly opposed to the system of _running_ cornices and _banded_[85]
capitals, in which the ornament flows along them horizontally, or is
twined round them, as the mouldings are in the early English capital,
and the foliage in many decorated ones.Such cornices have arisen from a
mistaken appliance of the running ornaments, which are proper to
archivolts, jambs, &c., to the features which have definite functions of
support.A tendril may nobly follow the outline of an arch, but must not
creep along a cornice, nor swathe or bandage a capital; it is essential
to the expression of these features that their ornament should have an
elastic and upward spring; and as the proper profile for the curve is
that of a tree bough, as we saw above, so the proper arrangement of its
farther ornament is that which best expresses rooted and ascendant
strength like that of foliage.There are certain very interesting exceptions to the rule (we shall see
a curious one presently); and in the carrying out of the rule itself, we
may see constant licenses taken by the great designers, and momentary
violations of it, like those above spoken of, respecting other
ornamental laws--violations which are for our refreshment, and for
increase of delight in the general observance; and this is one of the
peculiar beauties of the cornice _g_, which, rooting itself in strong
central clusters, suffers some of its leaves to fall languidly aside, as
the drooping outer leaves of a natural cluster do so often; but at the
very instant that it does this, in order that it may not lose any of its
expression of strength, a fruit-stalk is thrown up above the languid
leaves, absolutely vertical, as much stiffer and stronger than the rest
of the plant as the falling leaves are weaker.Cover this with your
finger, and the cornice falls to pieces, like a bouquet which has been
untied.There are some instances in which, though the real arrangement
is that of a running stem, throwing off leaves up and down, the positions
of the leaves give nearly as much elasticity and organisation to the
cornice, as if they had been rightly rooted; and others, like _b_, where
the reversed portion of the ornament is lost in the shade, and the
general expression of strength is got by the lower member.This cornice
will, nevertheless, be felt at once to be inferior to the rest; and
though we may often be called upon to admire designs of these kinds,
which would have been exquisite if not thus misplaced, the reader will
find that they are both of rare occurrence, and significative of
declining style; while the greater mass of the banded capitals are heavy
and valueless, mere aggregations of confused sculpture, swathed round
the extremity of the shaft, as if she had dipped it into a mass of
melted ornament, as the glass-blower does his blow-pipe into the metal,
and brought up a quantity adhering glutinously to its extremity.We have
many capitals of this kind in England: some of the worst and heaviest in
the choir of York.The later capitals of the Italian Gothic have the
same kind of effect, but owing to another cause: for their structure is
quite pure, and based on the Corinthian type: and it is the branching
form of the heads of the leaves which destroys the effect of their
organisation.On the other hand, some of the Italian cornices which are
actually composed by running tendrils, throwing off leaves into oval
interstices, are so massive in their treatment, and so marked and firm
in their vertical and arched lines, that they are nearly as suggestive
of support as if they had been arranged on the rooted system.A cornice
of this kind is used in St.Michele of Lucca (Plate VI.in the "Seven
Lamps," and XXI.here), and with exquisite propriety; for that cornice
is at once a crown to the story beneath it and a foundation to that
which is above it, and therefore unites the strength and elasticity of
the lines proper to the cornice with the submission and prostration of
those proper to the foundation.This, then, is the first point needing general notice in the
designs in Plate XVI.The second is the difference between the freedom
of the Northern and the sophistication of the classical cornices, in
connection with what has been advanced in Appendix 8.The cornices, _a_,
_d_, and _b_, are of the same date, but they show a singular difference
in the workman's temper: that at _b_ is a single copy of a classical
mosaic; and many carved cornices occur, associated with it, which are,
in like manner, mere copies of the Greek and Roman egg and arrow
mouldings.But the cornices _a_ and _d_ are copies of nothing of the
kind: the idea of them has indeed been taken from the Greek honeysuckle
ornament, but the chiselling of them is in no wise either Greek, or
Byzantine, in temper.The Byzantines were languid copyists: this work is
as energetic as its original; energetic, not in the quantity of work,
but in the spirit of it: an indolent man, forced into toil, may cover
large spaces with evidence of his feeble action, or accumulate his
dulness into rich aggregation of trouble, but it is gathered weariness
still.The man who cut those two uppermost cornices had no time to
spare: did as much cornice as he could in half an hour; but would not
endure the slightest trace of error in a curve, or of bluntness in an
edge.His work is absolutely unreproveable; keen, and true, as Nature's
own; his entire force is in it, and fixed on seeing that every line of
it shall be sharp and right: the faithful energy is in him: we shall see
something come of that cornice: The fellow who inlaid the other (_b_),
will stay where he is for ever; and when he has inlaid one leaf up, will
inlay another down,--and so undulate up and down to all eternity: but
the man of _a_ and _d_ will cut his way forward, or there is no truth in
handicrafts, nor stubbornness in stone.But there is something else noticeable in those two cornices,
besides the energy of them: as opposed either to _b_, or the Greek
honeysuckle or egg patterns, they are _natural_ designs.The Greek egg
and arrow cornice is a nonsense cornice, very noble in its lines, but
utterly absurd in meaning.Arrows have had nothing to do with eggs (at
least since Leda's time), neither are the so-called arrows like arrows,
nor the eggs like eggs, nor the honeysuckles like honeysuckles; they are
all conventionalised into a monotonous successiveness of
nothing,--pleasant to the eye, useless to the thought.But those
Christian cornices are, as far as may be, suggestive; there is not the
tenth of the work in them that there is in the Greek arrows, but, as far
as that work will go, it has consistent intention; with the fewest
possible incisions, and those of the easiest shape, they suggest the
true image, of clusters of leaves, each leaf with its central depression
from root to point, and that distinctly visible at almost any distance
from the eye, and in almost any light.Here, then, are two great new elements visible; energy and
naturalism:--Life, with submission to the laws of God, and love of his
works; this is Christianity, dealing with her classical models.Now look
back to what I said in Chap.of this dealing of hers, and
invention of the new Doric line; then to what is above stated (Sec.respecting that new Doric, and the boughs of trees; and now to the
evidence in the cutting of the leaves on the same Doric section, and see
how the whole is beginning to come together.We said that something would come of these two cornices, _a_ and
_d_.In _e_ and _f_ we see that something _has_ come of them: _e_ is
also from St.Mark's, and one of the earliest examples in Venice of the
transition from the Byzantine to the Gothic cornice.It is already
singularly developed; flowers have been added between the clusters of
leaves, and the leaves themselves curled over: and observe the
well-directed thought of the sculptor in this curling;--the old
incisions are retained below, and their excessive rigidity is one of the
proofs of the earliness of the cornice; but those incisions now stand
for the _under_ surface of the leaf; and behold, when it turns over, on
the top of it you see true _ribs_.Look at the upper and under surface
of a cabbage-leaf, and see what quick steps we are making.The fifth example (_f_) was cut in 1347; it is from the tomb of
Marco Giustiniani, in the church of St.John and Paul, and it exhibits
the character of the central Venetian Gothic fully developed.The lines
are all now soft and undulatory, though elastic; the sharp incisions
have become deeply-gathered folds; the hollow of the leaf is expressed
completely beneath, and its edges are touched with light, and incised
into several lobes, and their ribs delicately drawn above.(The flower
between is only accidentally absent; it occurs in most cornices of the
time.)But in both these cornices the reader will notice that while the
naturalism of the sculpture is steadily on the increase, the classical
formalism is still retained.The leaves are accurately numbered, and
sternly set in their places; they are leaves in office, and dare not
stir nor wave.They have the shapes of leaves, but not the functions,
"having the form of knowledge, but denying the power thereof."Look back to the XXXIIIrd paragraph of the first chapter,
and you will see the meaning of it.These cornices are the Venetian
Ecclesiastical Gothic; the Christian element struggling with the
Formalism of the Papacy,--the Papacy being entirely heathen in all its
principles.That officialism of the leaves and their ribs means
Apostolic succession, and I don't know how much more, and is already
preparing for the transition to old Heathenism again, and the
Renaissance.Now look to the last cornice (_g_).That is Protestantism,--a
slight touch of Dissent, hardly amounting to schism, in those falling
leaves, but true life in the whole of it.The forms all broken through,
and sent heaven knows where, but the root held fast; and the strong sap
in the branches; and, best of all, good fruit ripening and opening
straight towards heaven, and in the face of it, even though some of the
leaves lie in the dust.The cornice _f_ represents Heathenism and Papistry,
animated by the mingling of Christianity and nature.The good in it, the
life of it, the veracity and liberty of it, such as it has, are
Protestantism in its heart; the rigidity and saplessness are the
Romanism of it.It is the mind of Fra Angelico in the monk's
dress,--Christianity before the Reformation.The cornice _g_ has the
Lombardic life element in its fulness, with only some color and shape of
Classicalism mingled with it--the good of classicalism; as much method
and Formalism as are consistent with life, and fitting for it: The
continence within certain border lines, the unity at the root, the
simplicity of the great profile,--all these are the healthy classical
elements retained: the rest is reformation, new strength, and recovered
liberty.There is one more point about it especially noticeable.The
leaves are thoroughly natural in their general character, but they are
of no particular species: and after being something like cabbage-leaves
in the beginning, one of them suddenly becomes an ivy-leaf in the end.Now I don't know what to say of this.I know it, indeed, to be a
classical character;--it is eminently characteristic of Southern work;
and markedly distinctive of it from the Northern ornament, which would
have been oak, or ivy, or apple, but not anything, nor two things in
one.It is, I repeat, a clearly classical element; but whether a good or
bad element, I am not sure;--whether it is the last trace of Centaurism
and other monstrosity dying away; or whether it has a figurative
purpose, legitimate in architecture (though never in painting), and has
been rightly retained by the Christian sculptor, to express the working
of that spirit which grafts one nature upon another, and discerns a law
in its members warring against the law of its mind.These, then, being the points most noticeable in the spirit both
of the designs and the chiselling, we have now to return to the question
proposed in Sec.XIII., and observe the modifications of form of profile
which resulted from the changing contours of the leafage; for up to Sec.XIII., we had, as usual, considered the possible conditions of form in
the abstract;--the modes in which they have been derived from each other
in actual practice require to be followed in their turn.How the Greek
Doric or Greek ogee cornices were invented is not easy to determine,
and, fortunately, is little to our present purpose; for the mediaeval
ogee cornices have an independent development of their own, from the
first type of the concave cornice _a_ in Plate XV.That cornice occurs, in the simplest work, perfectly pure, but
in finished work it was quickly felt that there was a meagreness in its
junction with the wall beneath it, where it was set as here at _a_, Fig.LXIII., which could only be conquered by concealing such junction in a
bar of shadow.There were two ways of getting this bar: one by a
projecting roll at the foot of the cornice (_b_, Fig.), the other
by slipping the whole cornice a little forward (_c_.From
these two methods arise two groups of cornices and capitals, which we
shall pursue in succession.With the roll at the base (_b_, Fig.The
chain of its succession is represented from 1 to 6, in Plate XV.: 1 and
2 are the steps already gained, as in Fig.; and in them the
profile of cornice used is _a_ of Plate XV., or a refined condition of
_b_ of Fig.Now, keeping the same refined profile,
substitute the condition of it, _f_ of Fig.(and there accounted
for), above the roll here, and you have 3, Plate XV.This superadded
abacus was instantly felt to be harsh in its projecting angle; but you
know what to do with an angle when it is harsh.Use your simplest
chamfer on it (_a_ or _b_, Fig.LIII., page 287, above), but on the
visible side only, and you have fig.(the top stone being
made deeper that you may have room to chamfer it).4 is
the profile of Lombardic and Venetian early capitals and cornices, by
tens of thousands; and it continues into the late Venetian Gothic, with
this only difference, that as times advances, the vertical line at the
top of the original cornice begins to <DW72> outwards, and through a
series of years rises like the hazel wand in the hand of a diviner:--but
how slowly!a stone dial which marches but 45 degrees in three
centuries, and through the intermediate condition 5 arrives at 6, and so
stays.In tracing this chain I have kept all the profiles of the same height in
order to make the comparison more easy; the depth chosen is about
intermediate between that which is customary in cornices on the one
hand, which are often a little shorter, and capitals on the other, which
are often a little deeper.[87] And it is to be noted that the profiles 5
and 6 establish themselves in capitals chiefly, while 4 is retained in
cornices to the latest times.If the lower angle, which
was quickly felt to be hard, be rounded off, we have the form _a_, Fig.The front of the curved line is then decorated, as we have seen;
and the termination of the decorated surface marked by an incision, as
in an ordinary chamfer, as at _b_ here.This I believe to have been the
simple origin of most of the Venetian ogee cornices; but they are
farther complicated by the curves given to the leafage which flows over
them.In the ordinary Greek cornices, and in _a_ and _d_ of Plate XVI.,
the decoration is _incised_ from the outside profile, without any
suggestion of an interior surface of a different contour.But in the
leaf cornices which follow, the decoration is represented as _overlaid_
on one of the early profiles, and has another outside contour of its
own; which is, indeed, the true profile of the cornice, but beneath
which, more or less, the simpler profile is seen or suggested, which
terminates all the incisions of the chisel.This under profile will
often be found to be some condition of the type _a_ or _b_, Fig.;
and the leaf profile to be another ogee with its fullest curve up
instead of down, lapping over the cornice edge above, so that the entire
profile might be considered as made up of two ogee curves laid, like
packed herrings, head to tail.7 is a heavier contour, doubtless composed in the
same manner, but of which I had not marked the innermost profile, and
which I have given here only to complete the series which, from 7 to 12
inclusive, exemplifies the gradual restriction of the leaf outline, from
its boldest projection in the cornice to its most modest service in the
capital.This change, however, is not one which indicates difference of
age, but merely of office and position: the cornice 7 is from the tomb
of the Doge Andrea Dandolo (1350) in St.Mark's, 8 from a canopy over a
door of about the same period, 9 from the tomb of the Dogaressa Agnese
Venier (1411), 10 from that of Pietro Cornaro (1361),[88] and 11 from
that of Andrea Morosini (1347), all in the church of San Giov.and
Paola, all these being cornice profiles; and, finally, 12 from a capital
of the Ducal Palace, of fourteen century work.Now the reader will doubtless notice that in the three
examples, 10 to 12, the leaf has a different contour from that of 7, 8,
or 9.I have always desired
that the reader should theoretically consider the capital as a
concentration of the cornice; but in practice it often happens that the
cornice is, on the contrary, an unrolled capital; and one of the richest
early forms of the Byzantine cornice (not given in Plate XV., because its
separate character and importance require examination apart) is nothing
more than an unrolled continuation of the lower range of acanthus leaves
on the Corinthian capital.From this cornice others appear to have been
derived, like _e_ in Plate XVI., in which the acanthus outline has
become confused with that of the honeysuckle, and the rosette of the
centre of the Corinthian capital introduced between them; and thus their
forms approach more and more to those derived from the cornice itself.Now if the leaf has the contour of 10, 11, or 12, Plate XV., the profile
is either actually of a capital, or of a cornice derived from a capital;
while, if the leaf have the contour of 7 or 8, the profile is either
actually of a cornice or of a capital derived from a cornice.Where the
Byzantines use the acanthus, the Lombards use the Persepolitan
water-leaf; but the connection of the cornices and capitals is exactly
the same.Thus far, however, we have considered the characters of profile
which are common to the cornice and capital both.We have now to note
what farther decorative features or peculiarities belong to the capital
itself, or result from the theoretical gathering of the one into the
other.The five types there given, represented
the five different methods of concentration of the root of cornices, _a_
of Fig.V. Now, as many profiles of cornices as were developed in Plate
XV.from this cornice root, there represented by the dotted <DW72>, so
many may be applied to each of the five types in Fig.XXII.,--applied
simply in _a_ and _b_, but with farther modifications, necessitated by
their truncations or spurs, in _c_, _d_, and _e_.Then, these cornice profiles having been so applied in such length and
<DW72> as is proper for capitals, the farther condition comes into effect
described in Chapter IX.XXIV., and any one of the cornices in Plate
XV.may become the _abacus_ of a capital formed out of any other, or
out of itself.The infinity of forms thus resultant cannot, as may well
be supposed, be exhibited or catalogued in the space at present
permitted to us: but the reader, once master of the principle, will
easily be able to investigate for himself the syntax of all examples
that may occur to him, and I shall only here, as a kind of exercise, put
before him a few of those which he will meet with most frequently in his
Venetian inquiries, or which illustrate points, not hitherto touched
upon, in the disposition of the abacus.the capital at the top, on the left hand, is the
rudest possible gathering of the plain Christian Doric cornice, _d_ of
Plate XV.The shaft is octagonal, and the capital is not cut to fit it,
but is square at the base; and the curve of its profile projects on two
of its sides more than on the other two, so as to make the abacus
oblong, in order to carry an oblong mass of brickwork, dividing one of
the upper lights of a Lombard campanile at Milan.The awkward stretching
of the brickwork, to do what the capital ought to have done, is very
remarkable.There is here no second superimposed abacus.The figure on the right hand, at the top, shows the simple
but perfect fulfilment of all the requirements in which the first example
fails.The mass of brickwork to be carried is exactly the same in size
and shape; but instead of being trusted to a single shaft, it has two of
smaller area (compare Chap.), and all the expansion
necessary is now gracefully attained by their united capitals, hewn out
of one stone.Take the section of these capitals through their angle,
and nothing can be simpler or purer; it is composed of 2, in Plate XV.,
used for the capital itself, with _c_ of Fig.used for the
abacus; the reader could hardly have a neater little bit of syntax for a
first lesson.If the section be taken through the side of the bell, the
capital profile is the root of cornices, _a_ of Fig.This capital is somewhat remarkable in having its sides perfectly
straight, some slight curvature being usual on so bold a scale; but it
is all the better as a first example, the method of reduction being
of order _d_, in Fig.110, and with a concave cut, as in
Fig.These two capitals are from the cloister of the duomo
of Verona.represents an exquisitely
finished example of the same type, from St.Above, at 2,
in Plate II., the plan of the shafts was given, but I inadvertently
reversed their position: in comparing that plan with Plate XVII., Plate
II.The capitals, with the band connecting
them, are all cut out of one block; their profile is an adaptation of 4
of Plate XV., with a plain headstone superimposed.This method of
reduction is that of order _d_ in Fig.XXII., but the peculiarity of
treatment of their truncation is highly interesting.represents the plans of the capitals at the base, the shaded parts being
the bells: the open line, the roll with its connecting band.The bell of
the one, it will be seen, is the exact reverse of that of the other: the
angle truncations are, in both, curved horizontally as well as
uprightly; but their curve is convex in the one, and in the other
concave.will show the effect of both, with the farther
incisions, to the same depth, on the flank of the one with the concave
truncation, which join with the rest of its singularly bold and keen
execution in giving the impression of its rather having been cloven
into its form by the sweeps of a sword, than by the dull travail of a
chisel.Its workman was proud of it, as well he might be: he has written
his name upon its front (I would that more of his fellows had been as
kindly vain), and the goodly stone proclaims for ever, ADAMINUS DE
SANCTO GIORGIO ME FECIT.The reader will easily understand that the gracefulness of
this kind of truncation, as he sees it in Plate XVII., soon suggested the
idea of reducing it to a vegetable outline, and laying four healing
leaves, as it were, upon the wounds which the sword had made.These four
leaves, on the truncations of the capital, correspond to the four leaves
which we saw, in like manner, extend themselves over the spurs of the
base, and, as they increase in delicacy of execution, form one of the
most lovely groups of capitals which the Gothic workmen ever invented;
represented by two perfect types in the capitals of the Piazzetta
columns of Venice.But this pure group is an isolated one; it remains in
the first simplicity of its conception far into the thirteenth century,
while around it rise up a crowd of other forms, imitative of the old
Corinthian, and in which other and younger leaves spring up in luxuriant
growth among the primal four.The varieties of their grouping we shall
enumerate hereafter: one general characteristic of them all must be
noted here.The reader has been told repeatedly[89] that there are two,
and only two, real orders of capitals, originally represented by the
Corinthian and the Doric; and distinguished by the concave or convex
contours of their bells, as shown by the dotted lines at _e_, Fig.And hitherto, respecting the capital, we have been exclusively
concerned with the methods in which these two families of simple
contours have gathered themselves together, and obtained reconciliation
to the abacus above, and the shaft below.But the last paragraph
introduces us to the surface ornament disposed upon these, in the
chiselling of which the characters described above, Sec.XXVIII., which
are but feebly marked in the cornice, boldly distinguish and divide the
families of the capital.Whatever the nature of the ornament be, it must clearly have
relief of some kind, and must present projecting surfaces separated by
incisions.But it is a very material question whether the contour,
hitherto broadly considered as that of the entire bell, shall be that of
the _outside_ of the projecting and relieved ornaments, or of the
_bottoms of the incisions_ which divide them; whether, that is to say,
we shall first cut out the bell of our capital quite smooth, and then
cut farther into it, with incisions, which shall leave ornamental forms
in relief, or whether, in originally cutting the contour of the bell, we
shall leave projecting bits of stone, which we may afterwards work into
the relieved ornament.Clearly, if to ornament the
already hollowed profile, _b_, we cut deep incisions into it, we shall
so far weaken it at the top, that it will nearly lose all its supporting
power.Clearly, also, if to ornament the already bulging profile _c_ we
were to leave projecting pieces of stone outside of it, we should nearly
destroy all its relation to the original sloping line X, and produce an
unseemly and ponderous mass, hardly recognizable as a cornice profile.It is evident, on the other hand, that we can afford to cut into this
profile without fear of destroying its strength, and that we can afford
to leave projections outside of the other, without fear of destroying
its lightness.Such is, accordingly, the natural disposition of the
sculpture, and the two great families of capitals are therefore
distinguished, not merely by their concave and convex contours, but by
the ornamentation being left outside the bell of the one, and cut into
the bell of the other; so that, in either case, the ornamental portions
will fall _between the dotted lines_ at _e_, Fig.V., and the pointed
oval, or vesica piscis, which is traced by them, may be called the Limit
of ornamentation.Several distinctions in the quantity and style of the
ornament must instantly follow from this great distinction in its
position.For, observe: since in the Doric
profile, _c_ of Fig.V., the contour itself is to be composed of the
surface of the ornamentation, this ornamentation must be close and
united enough to form, or at least suggest, a continuous surface; it
must, therefore, be rich in quantity and close in aggregation; otherwise
it will destroy the massy character of the profile it adorns, and
approximate it to its opposite, the concave.On the other hand, the
ornament left projecting from the concave, must be sparing enough, and
dispersed enough, to allow the concave bell to be clearly seen beneath
it; otherwise it will choke up the concave profile, and approximate it
to its opposite, the convex.For, clearly, as the sculptor
of the concave profile must leave masses of rough stone prepared for his
outer ornament, and cannot finish them at once, but must complete the
cutting of the smooth bell beneath first, and then return to the
projecting masses (for if he were to finish these latter first, they
would assuredly, if delicate or sharp, be broken as he worked on; since,
I say, he must work in this foreseeing and predetermined method, he is
sure to reduce the system of his ornaments to some definite symmetrical
order before he begins); and the habit of conceiving beforehand all that
he has to do, will probably render him not only more orderly in its
arrangement, but more skilful and accurate in its execution, than if he
could finish all as he worked on.On the other hand, the sculptor of the
convex profile has its smooth surface laid before him, as a piece of
paper on which he can sketch at his pleasure; the incisions he makes in
it are like touches of a dark pencil; and he is at liberty to roam over
the surface in perfect freedom, with light incisions or with deep;
finishing here, suggesting there, or perhaps in places leaving the
surface altogether smooth.It is ten to one, therefore, but that, if he
yield to the temptation, he becomes irregular in design, and rude in
handling; and we shall assuredly find the two families of capitals
distinguished, the one by its symmetrical, thoroughly organised, and
exquisitely executed ornament, the other by its rambling, confused, and
rudely chiselled ornament: But, on the other hand, while we shall
often have to admire the disciplined precision of the one, and as often
to regret the irregular rudeness of the other, we shall not fail to find
balancing qualities in both.The severity of the disciplinarian capital
represses the power of the imagination; it gradually degenerates into
Formalism; and the indolence which cannot escape from its stern demand
of accurate workmanship, seeks refuge in copyism of established forms,
and loses itself at last in lifeless mechanism.The license of the
other, though often abused, permits full exercise to the imagination:
the mind of the sculptor, unshackled by the niceties of chiselling,
wanders over its orbed field in endless fantasy; and, when generous as
well as powerful, repays the liberty which has been granted to it with
interest, by developing through the utmost wildness and fulness of its
thoughts, an order as much more noble than the mechanical symmetry of
the opponent school, as the domain which it regulates is vaster.And now the reader shall judge whether I had not reason to cast
aside the so-called Five orders of the Renaissance architects, with
their volutes and fillets, and to tell him that there were only two real
orders, and that there could never be more.[90] For we now find that
these two great and real orders are representative of the two great
influences which must for ever divide the heart of man: the one of
Lawful Discipline, with its perfection and order, but its danger of
degeneracy into Formalism; the other of Lawful Freedom, with its vigor
and variety, but its danger of degeneracy into Licentiousness.I shall not attempt to give any illustrations here of the most
elaborate developments of either order; they will be better given on a
larger scale: but the examples in Plate XVII.represent the
two methods of ornament in their earliest appliance.The two lower
capitals in Plate XVII.are a pure type of the concave school; the two
in the centre of Plate XVIII., of the convex.are two Lombardic capitals; that on the left from Sta.Sofia at Padua,
that on the right from the cortile of St.They both
have the concave angle truncation; but being of date prior to the time
when the idea of the concave bell was developed, they are otherwise left
square, and decorated with the surface ornament characteristic of the
convex school.The relation of the designs to each other is interesting;
the cross being prominent in the centre of each, but more richly
relieved in that from St.The two beneath are from the
southern portico of St.Mark's; the shafts having been of different
lengths, and neither, in all probability, originally intended for their
present place, they have double abaci, of which the uppermost is the
cornice running round the whole facade.The zigzagged capital is highly
curious, and in its place very effective and beautiful, although one of
the exceptions which it was above noticed that we should sometimes find
to the law stated in Sec.The lower capital, which is also of the true convex school,
exhibits one of the conditions of the spurred type, _e_ of Fig.XXII.,
respecting which one or two points must be noticed.If we were to take up the plan of the simple spur, represented at _e_ in
Fig.110, and treat it, with the salvia leaf, as we did the
spur of the base, we should have for the head of our capital a plan like
Fig.LXVI., which is actually that of one of the capitals of the Fondaco
de' Turchi at Venice; with this only difference, that the intermediate
curves between the spurs would have been circular: the reason they are
not so, here, is that the decoration, instead of being confined to the
spur, is now spread over the whole mass, and contours are therefore
given to the intermediate curves which fit them for this ornament; the
inside shaded space being the head of the shaft, and the outer, the
abacus.a characteristic type of the plans
of the spurred capitals, generally preferred by the sculptors of the
convex school, but treated with infinite variety, the spurs often being
cut into animal forms, or the incisions between them multiplied, for
richer effect; and in our own Norman capital the type _c_ of Fig.is variously subdivided by incisions on its <DW72>, approximating in
general effect to many conditions of the real spurred type, _e_, but
totally differing from them in principle.The treatment of the spur in the concave school is far more
complicated, being borrowed in nearly every case from the original
Corinthian.The
spur itself is carved into a curling tendril or concave leaf, which
supports the projecting angle of a four-sided abacus, whose hollow sides
fall back behind the bell, and have generally a rosette or other
ornament in their centres.The mediaeval architects often put another
square abacus above all, as represented by the shaded portion of Fig.LXVII., and some massy conditions of this form, elaborately ornamented,
are very beautiful; but it is apt to become rigid and effeminate, as
assuredly it is in the original Corinthian, which is thoroughly mean and
meagre in its upper tendrils and abacus.Mark's, and
singular in having double spurs; it is therefore to be compared with
the doubly spurred base, also from St Mark's, in Plate XI.In other
respects it is a good example of the union of breadth of mass with
subtlety of curvature, which characterises nearly all the spurred
capitals of the convex school.: the
inner shaded circle is the head of the shaft; the white cross, the
bottom of the capital, which expands itself into the external shaded
portions at the top.Each spur, thus formed, is cut like a ship's bow,
with the Doric profile; the surfaces so obtained are then charged with
arborescent ornament.I shall not here farther exemplify the conditions of the
treatment of the spur, because I am afraid of confusing the reader's
mind, and diminishing the distinctness of his conception of the
differences between the two great orders, which it has been my principal
object to develope throughout this chapter.If all my readers lived in
London, I could at once fix this difference in their minds by a simple,
yet somewhat curious illustration.In many parts of the west end of
London, as, for instance, at the corners of Belgrave Square, and the
north side of Grosvenor Square, the Corinthian capitals of newly-built
houses are put into cages of wire.The wire cage is the exact form of
the typical capital of the convex school; the Corinthian capital,
within, is a finished and highly decorated example of the concave.The
space between the cage and capital is the limit of ornamentation.Those of my readers, however, to whom this illustration is
inaccessible, must be content with the two profiles, 13 and 14, on Plate
XV.If they will glance along the line of sections from 1 to 6, they
will see that the profile 13 is their final development, with a
superadded cornice for its abacus.It is taken from a capital in a very
important ruin of a palace, near the Rialto of Venice, and hereafter to
be described; the projection, outside of its principal curve, is the
profile of its _superadded_ leaf ornamentation; it may be taken as one
of the simplest, yet a perfect type of the concave group.The profile 14 is that of the capital of the main shaft of
the northern portico of St.Mark's, the most finished example I ever met
with of the convex family, to which, in spite of the central inward bend
of its profile, it is marked as distinctly belonging, by the bold convex
curve at its root, springing from the shaft in the line of the Christian
Doric cornice, and exactly reversing the structure of the other profile,
which rises from the shaft, like a palm leaf from its stem.Farther, in
the profile 13, the innermost line is that of the bell; but in the
profile 14, the outermost line is that of the bell, and the inner line
is the limit of the incisions of the chisel, in undercutting a
reticulated veil of ornament, surrounding a flower like a lily; most
ingeniously, and, I hope, justly, conjectured by the Marchese Selvatico
to have been intended for an imitation of the capitals of the temple of
Solomon, which Hiram made, with "nets of checker work, and wreaths of
chain work for the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars... and
the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in
the porch."On this exquisite capital there is imposed an abacus of
the profile with which we began our investigation long ago, the profile _a_
of Fig.V. This abacus is formed by the cornice already given, _a_, of
Plate XVI.: and therefore we have, in this lovely Venetian capital, the
summary of the results of our investigation, from its beginning to its
close: the type of the first cornice; the decoration of it, in its
emergence from the classical models; the gathering into the capital; the
superimposition of the secondary cornice, and the refinement of the bell
of the capital by triple curvature in the two limits of chiselling.I
cannot express the exquisite refinements of the curves on the small
scale of Plate XV.; I will give them more accurately in a larger
engraving; but the scale on which they are here given will not prevent
the reader from perceiving, and let him note it thoughtfully, that the
outer curve of the noble capital is the one which was our first example
of associated curves; that I have had no need, throughout the whole of
our inquiry, to refer to any other ornamental line than the three which
I at first chose, the simplest of those which Nature set by chance
before me; and that this lily, of the delicate Venetian marble, has but
been wrought, by the highest human art, into the same line which the
clouds disclose, when they break from the rough rocks of the flank of
the Matterhorn.FOOTNOTES:

  [84] In very early Doric it was an absolute right line; and that
    capital is therefore derived from the pure cornice root, represented
    by the dotted line.[85] The word banded is used by Professor Willis in a different
    sense; which I would respect, by applying it in his sense always to
    the Impost, and in mine to the capital itself.(This note is not for
    the general reader, who need not trouble himself about the matter.)[86] The Renaissance period being one of return to formalism on the
    one side, of utter licentiousness on the other, so that sometimes,
    as here, I have to declare its lifelessness, at other times (Chap.There is, of course, no
    contradiction in this: but the reader might well ask how I knew the
    change from the base 11 to the base 12, in Plate XII., to be one
    from temperance to luxury; and from the cornice _f_ to the cornice
    _g_, in Plate XVI., to be one from formalism to vitality.I know it,
    both by certain internal evidences, on which I shall have to dwell
    at length hereafter, and by the context of the works of the time.But the outward signs might in both ornaments be the same,
    distinguishable only as signs of opposite tendencies by the event of
    both.The blush of shame cannot always be told from the blush of
    indignation.[87] The reader must always remember that a cornice, in becoming a
    capital, must, if not originally bold and deep, have depth added to
    its profile, in order to reach the just proportion of the lower
    member of the shaft head; and that therefore the small Greek egg
    cornices are utterly incapable of becoming capitals till they have
    totally changed their form and depth.The Renaissance architects,
    who never obtained hold of a right principle but they made it worse
    than a wrong one by misapplication, caught the idea of turning the
    cornice into a capital, but did not comprehend the necessity of the
    accompanying change of depth.Hence we have pilaster heads formed of
    small egg cornices, and that meanest of all mean heads of shafts,
    the coarse Roman Doric profile chopped into a small egg and arrow
    moulding, both which may be seen disfiguring half the buildings in
    London.[88] I have taken these dates roughly from Selvatico; their absolute
    accuracy to within a year or two, is here of no importance.THE ARCHIVOLT AND APERTURE.I. If the windows and doors of some of our best northern Gothic
buildings were built up, and the ornament of their archivolts concealed,
there would often remain little but masses of dead wall and unsightly
buttress; the whole vitality of the building consisting in the graceful
proportions or rich mouldings of its apertures.It is not so in the
south, where, frequently, the aperture is a mere dark spot on the
variegated wall; but there the column, with its horizontal or curved
architrave, assumes an importance of another kind, equally dependent
upon the methods of lintel and archivolt decoration.These, though in
their richness of minor variety they defy all exemplification, may be
very broadly generalized.Of the mere lintel, indeed, there is no specific decoration, nor can be;
it has no organism to direct its ornament, and therefore may receive any
kind and degree of ornament, according to its position.In a Greek
temple, it has meagre horizontal lines; in a Romanesque church, it
becomes a row of upright niches, with an apostle in each; and may become
anything else at the architect's will.But the arch head has a natural
organism, which separates its ornament into distinct families, broadly
definable.In speaking of the arch-line and arch masonry, we considered
the arch to be cut straight through the wall; so that, if half built, it
would have the appearance at _a_, Fig.But in the chapter on Form
of Apertures, we found that the side of the arch, or jamb of the
aperture, might often require to be bevelled, so as to give the section
_b_, Fig.It is easily conceivable that when two ranges of
voussoirs were used, one over another, it would be easier to leave
those beneath, of a smaller diameter, than to bevel them to accurate
junction with those outside.Whether influenced by this facility, or by
decorative instinct, the early northern builders often substitute for
the bevel the third condition, _c_, of Fig.; so that, of the three
forms in that figure, _a_ belongs principally to the south, _c_ to the
north, and _b_ indifferently to both.If the arch in the northern building be very deep, its depth
will probably be attained by a succession of steps, like that in _c_; and
the richest results of northern archivolt decoration are entirely based on
the aggregation of the ornament of these several steps; while those of
the south are only the complete finish and perfection of the ornament of
one.In this ornament of the single arch, the points for general note
are very few.It was, in the first instance, derived from the classical
architrave,[91] and the early Romanesque arches are nothing but such an
architrave, bent round.The horizontal lines of the latter become
semicircular, but their importance and value remain exactly the same;
their continuity is preserved across all the voussoirs, and the joints
and functions of the latter are studiously concealed.As the builders
get accustomed to the arch, and love it better, they cease to be ashamed
of its structure: the voussoirs begin to show themselves confidently,
and fight for precedence with the architrave lines; and there is an
entanglement of the two structures, in consequence, like the circular
and radiating lines of a cobweb, until at last the architrave lines get
worsted, and driven away outside of the voussoirs; being permitted to
stay at all only on condition of their dressing themselves in mediaeval
costume, as in the plate opposite.V. In other cases, however, before the entire discomfiture of the
architrave, a treaty of peace is signed between the adverse parties on
these terms: That the architrave shall entirely dismiss its inner three
meagre lines, and leave the space of them to the voussoirs, to display
themselves after their manner; but that, in return for this concession,
the architrave shall have leave to expand the small cornice which
usually terminates it (the reader had better look at the original form
in that of the Erechtheum, in the middle of the Elgin room of the
British Museum) into bolder prominence, and even to put brackets under
it, as if it were a roof cornice, and thus mark with a bold shadow the
terminal line of the voussoirs.This condition is seen in the arch from
St.Pietro of Pistoja, Plate XIII., above.If the Gothic spirit of the building be thoroughly determined,
and victorious, the architrave cornice is compelled to relinquish its
classical form, and take the profile of a Gothic cornice or dripstone;
while, in other cases, as in much of the Gothic of Verona, it is forced
to disappear altogether.But the voussoirs then concede, on the other
hand, so much of their dignity as to receive a running ornament of
foliage or animals, like a classical frieze, and continuous round the
arch.In fact, the contest between the adversaries may be seen running
through all the early architecture of Italy: success inclining sometimes
to the one, sometimes to the other, and various kinds of truce or
reconciliation being effected between them: sometimes merely formal,
sometimes honest and affectionate, but with no regular succession in
time.The greatest victory of the voussoir is to annihilate the cornice,
and receive an ornament of its own outline, and entirely limited by its
own joints: and yet this may be seen in the very early apse of Murano.The most usual condition, however, is that unity of the two
members above described, Sec.V., and which may be generally represented
by the archivolt section _a_, Fig.; and from this descend a family of
Gothic archivolts of the highest importance.For the cornice, thus
attached to the arch, suffers exactly the same changes as the level
cornice, or capital; receives, in due time, its elaborate ogee profile
and leaf ornaments, like Fig.; and, when the shaft
loses its shape, and is lost in the later Gothic jamb, the archivolt has
influence enough to introduce this ogee profile in the jamb also,
through the banded impost: and we immediately find ourselves involved in
deep successions of ogee mouldings in sides of doors and windows, which
never would have been thought of, but for the obstinate resistance of
the classical architrave to the attempts of the voussoir at its
degradation or banishment.This, then, will be the first great head under which we shall
in future find it convenient to arrange a large number of archivolt
decorations.It is the distinctively Southern and Byzantine form, and
typically represented by the section _a_, of Fig.; and it is
susceptible of almost every species of surface ornament, respecting
which only this general law may be asserted: that, while the outside or
vertical surface may properly be decorated, and yet the soffit or under
surface left plain, the soffit is never to be decorated, and the outer
surface left plain.Much beautiful sculpture is, in the best Byzantine
buildings, half lost by being put under soffits; but the eye is led to
discover it, and even to demand it, by the rich chasing of the outside
of the voussoirs.It would have been an hypocrisy to carve them
externally only.But there is not the smallest excuse for carving the
soffit, and not the outside; for, in that case, we approach the building
under the idea of its being perfectly plain; we do not look for the
soffit decoration, and, of course, do not see it: or, if we do, it is
merely to regret that it should not be in a better place.In the
Renaissance architects, it may, perhaps, for once, be considered a
merit, that they put their bad decoration systematically in the places
where we should least expect it, and can seldomest see it:--Approaching
the Scuola di San Rocco, you probably will regret the extreme plainness
and barrenness of the window traceries; but, if you will go very close
to the wall beneath the windows, you may, on sunny days, discover a
quantity of panel decorations which the ingenious architect has
concealed under the soffits.The custom of decorating the arch soffit with panelling is a Roman
application of the Greek roof ornament, which, whatever its intrinsic
merit (compare Chap.), may rationally be applied to waggon
vaults, as of St.Peter's, and to arch soffits under which one walks.But the Renaissance architects had not wit enough to reflect that people
usually do not walk through windows.So far, then, of the Southern archivolt: In Fig.LXIX., above,
it will be remembered that _c_ represents the simplest form of the
Northern.In the farther development of this, which we have next to
consider, the voussoirs, in consequence of their own negligence or
over-confidence, sustain a total and irrecoverable defeat.That
archivolt is in its earliest conditions perfectly pure and
undecorated,--the simplest and rudest of Gothic forms.Necessarily, when
it falls on the pier, and meets that of the opposite arch, the entire
section of masonry is in the shape of a cross, and is carried by the
crosslet shaft, which we above stated to be distinctive of Northern
design.I am more at a loss to account for the sudden and fixed
development of this type of archivolt than for any other architectural
transition with which I am acquainted.But there it is, pure and firmly
established, as early as the building of St.Michele of Pavia; and we
have thenceforward only to observe what comes of it.X. We find it first, as I said, perfectly barren; cornice and
architrave altogether ignored, the existence of such things practically
denied, and a plain, deep-cut recess with a single mighty shadow
occupying their place.The voussoirs, thinking their great adversary
utterly defeated, are at no trouble to show themselves; visible enough
in both the upper and under archivolts, they are content to wait the
time when, as might have been hoped, they should receive a new
decoration peculiar to themselves.In this state of paralysis, or expectation, their flank is turned
by an insidious chamfer.The edges of the two great blank archivolts are
felt to be painfully conspicuous; all the four are at once beaded or
chamfered, as at _b_, Fig.; a rich group of deep lines, running
concentrically with the arch, is the result on the instant, and the fate
of the voussoirs is sealed.They surrender at once without a struggle,
and unconditionally; the chamfers deepen and multiply themselves, cover
the soffit, ally themselves with other forms resulting from grouped
shafts or traceries, and settle into the inextricable richness of the
fully developed Gothic jamb and arch; farther complicated in the end by
the addition of niches to their recesses, as above described.The voussoirs, in despair, go over to the classical camp, in
hope of receiving some help or tolerance from their former enemies.They
receive it indeed: but as traitors should, to their own eternal
dishonor.They are sharply chiselled at the joints, or rusticated, or
cut into masks and satyrs' heads, and so set forth and pilloried in the
various detestable forms of which the simplest is given above in Plate
XIII.(on the left); and others may be seen in nearly every large
building in London, more especially in the bridges; and, as if in pure
spite at the treatment they had received from the archivolt, they are
now not content with vigorously showing their lateral joints, but shape
themselves into right-angled steps at their heads, cutting to pieces
their limiting line, which otherwise would have had sympathy with that
of the arch, and fitting themselves to their new friend, the Renaissance
Ruled Copy-book wall.It had been better they had died ten times over,
in their own ancient cause, than thus prolonged their existence.We bid them farewell in their dishonor, to return to our
victorious chamfer.It had not, we said, obtained so easy a conquest,
unless by the help of certain forms of the grouped shaft.The chamfer
was quite enough to decorate the archivolts, if there were no more than
two; but if, as above noticed in Sec.III., the archivolt was very deep,
and composed of a succession of such steps, the multitude of chamferings
were felt to be weak and insipid, and instead of dealing with the
outside edges of the archivolts, the group was softened by introducing
solid shafts in their dark inner angles.This, the manliest and best
condition of the early northern jamb and archivolt, is represented in
section at fig.; and its simplest aspect in Plate V.,
from the Broletto of Como,--an interesting example, because there the
voussoirs being in the midst of their above-described southern contest
with the architrave, were better prepared for the flank attack upon them
by the shaft and chamfer, and make a noble resistance, with the help of
color, in which even the shaft itself gets slightly worsted, and cut
across in several places, like General Zach's column at Marengo.The shaft, however, rapidly rallies, and brings up its own
peculiar decorations to its aid; and the intermediate archivolts receive
running or panelled ornaments, also, until we reach the exquisitely rich
conditions of our own Norman archivolts, and of the parallel Lombardic
designs, such as the entrance of the Duomo, and of San Fermo, at Verona.This change, however, occupies little time, and takes place principally
in doorways, owing to the greater thickness of wall, and depth of
archivolt; so that we find the rich shafted succession of ornament, in
the doorway and window aperture, associated with the earliest and rudest
double archivolt, in the nave arches, at St.The nave
arches, therefore, are most usually treated by the chamfer, and the
voussoirs are there defeated much sooner than by the shafted
arrangements, which they resist, as we saw, in the south by color; and
even in the north, though forced out of their own shape, they take that
of birds' or monsters' heads, which for some time peck and pinch the
rolls of the archivolt to their hearts' content; while the Norman zigzag
ornament allies itself with them, each zigzag often restraining itself
amicably between the joints of each voussoir in the ruder work, and even
in the highly finished arches, distinctly presenting a concentric or
sunlike arrangement of lines; so much so, as to prompt the conjecture,
above stated, Chap.XXVI., that all such ornaments were intended
to be typical of light issuing from the orb of the arch.I doubt the
intention, but acknowledge the resemblance; which perhaps goes far to
account for the never-failing delightfulness of this zigzag decoration.The diminution of the zigzag, as it gradually shares the defeat of the
voussoir, and is at last overwhelmed by the complicated, railroad-like
fluency of the later Gothic mouldings, is to me one of the saddest
sights in the drama of architecture.One farther circumstance is deserving of especial note in Plate
V., the greater depth of the voussoirs at the top of the arch.This has
been above alluded to as a feature of good construction, Chap.; it is to be noted now as one still more valuable in decoration:
for when we arrive at the deep succession of concentric archivolts, with
which northern portals, and many of the associated windows, are headed,
we immediately find a difficulty in reconciling the outer curve with the
inner.If, as is sometimes the case, the width of the group of
archivolts be twice or three times that of the inner aperture, the inner
arch may be distinctly pointed, and the outer one, if drawn with
concentric arcs, approximate very nearly to a round arch.This is
actually the case in the later Gothic of Verona; the outer line of the
archivolt having a hardly perceptible point, and every inner arch of
course forming the point more distinctly, till the innermost becomes a
lancet.By far the nobler method, however, is that of the pure early
Italian Gothic; to make every outer arch a _magnified fac-simile_ of the
innermost one, every arc including the same number of degrees, but
degrees of a larger circle.The result is the condition represented in
Plate V., often found in far bolder development; exquisitely springy and
elastic in its expression, and entirely free from the heaviness and
monotony of the deep northern archivolts.We have not spoken of the intermediate form, _b_, of Fig.(which its convenience for admission of light has rendered common in
nearly all architectures), because it has no transitions peculiar to
itself: in the north it sometimes shares the fate of the outer
architrave, and is channelled into longitudinal mouldings; sometimes
remains smooth and massy, as in military architecture, or in the simpler
forms of domestic and ecclesiastical.In Italy it receives surface
decoration like the architrave, but has, perhaps, something of peculiar
expression in being placed between the tracery of the window within, and
its shafts and tabernacle work without, as in the Duomo of Florence: in
this position it is always kept smooth in surface, and inlaid (or
painted) with delicate arabesques; while the tracery and the tabernacle
work are richly sculptured.The example of its treatment by 
voussoirs, given in Plate XIX., may be useful to the reader as a kind of
central expression of the aperture decoration of the pure Italian
Gothic;--aperture decoration proper; applying no shaft work to the
jambs, but leaving the bevelled opening unenriched; using on the outer
archivolt the voussoirs and concentric architrave in reconcilement (the
latter having, however, some connection with the Norman zigzag); and
beneath them, the pure Italian two-pieced and mid-cusped arch, with rich
cusp decoration.It is a Veronese arch, probably of the thirteenth
century, and finished with extreme care; the red portions are all in
brick, delicately cast: and the most remarkable feature of the whole is
the small piece of brick inlaid on the angle of each stone voussoir,
with a most just feeling, which every artist will at once understand,
that the color ought not to be let go all at once.We have traced the various conditions of treatment in the
archivolt alone; but, except in what has been said of the peculiar
expression of the voussoirs, we might throughout have spoken in the same
terms of the jamb.Even a parallel to the expression of the voussoir may
be found in the Lombardic and Norman divisions of the shafts, by zigzags
and other transverse ornamentation, which in the end are all swept away
by the canaliculated mouldings.Then, in the recesses of these and of
the archivolts alike, the niche and statue decoration develops itself;
and the vaulted and cavernous apertures are covered with incrustations
of fretwork, and with every various application of foliage to their
fantastic mouldings.I have kept the inquiry into the proper ornament of the
archivolt wholly free from all confusion with the questions of beauty in
tracery; for, in fact, all tracery is a mere multiplication and
entanglement of small archivolts, and its cusp ornament is a minor
condition of that proper to the spandril.It does not reach its
completely defined form until the jamb and archivolt have been divided
into longitudinal mouldings; and then the tracery is formed by the
innermost group of the shafts or fillets, bent into whatever forms or
foliations the designer may choose; but this with a delicacy of
adaptation which I rather choose to illustrate by particular examples,
of which we shall meet with many in the course of our inquiry, than to
delay the reader by specifying here.As for the conditions of beauty in
the disposition of the tracery bars, I see no hope of dealing with the
subject fairly but by devoting, if I can find time, a separate essay to
it--which, in itself, need not be long, but would involve, before it
could be completed, the examination of the whole mass of materials
lately collected by the indefatigable industry of the English architects
who have devoted their special attention to this subject, and which are
of the highest value as illustrating the chronological succession or
mechanical structure of tracery, but which, in most cases, touch on
their aesthetic merits incidentally only.Of works of this kind, by far
the best I have met with is Mr.Edmund Sharpe's, on Decorated Windows,
which seems to me, as far as a cursory glance can enable me to judge, to
exhaust the subject as respects English Gothic; and which may be
recommended to the readers who are interested in the subject, as
containing a clear and masterly enunciation of the general principles by
which the design of tracery has been regulated, from its first
development to its final degradation.FOOTNOTES:

  [91] The architrave is properly the horizontal piece of stone laid
    across the tops of the pillars in Greek buildings, and commonly
    marked with horizontal lines, obtained by slight projections of its
    surface, while it is protected above in the richer orders, by a
    small cornice.I. The modes of decoration hitherto considered, have been common to
the exteriors and interiors of all noble buildings; and we have taken no
notice of the various kinds of ornament which require protection from
weather, and are necessarily confined to interior work.But in the case
of the roof, the exterior and interior treatments become, as we saw in
construction, so also in decoration, separated by broad and bold
distinctions.One side of a wall is, in most cases, the same as another,
and if its structure be concealed, it is mostly on the inside; but, in
the roof, the anatomical structure, out of which decoration should
naturally spring, is visible, if at all, in the interior only: so that
the subject of internal ornament becomes both wide and important, and
that of external, comparatively subordinate.Now, so long as we were concerned principally with the outside of
buildings, we might with safety leave expressional character out of the
question for the time, because it is not to be expected that all persons
who pass the building, or see it from a distance, shall be in the temper
which the building is properly intended to induce; so that ornaments
somewhat at variance with this temper may often be employed externally
without painful effect.But these ornaments would be inadmissible in the
interior, for those who enter will for the most part either be in the
proper temper which the building requires, or desirous of acquiring it.(The distinction is not rigidly observed by the mediaeval builders, and
grotesques, or profane subjects, occur in the interior of churches, in
bosses, crockets, capitals, brackets, and such other portions of minor
ornament: but we do not find the interior wall covered with hunting and
battle pieces, as often the Lombardic exteriors.)And thus the interior
expression of the roof or ceiling becomes necessarily so various, and
the kind and degree of fitting decoration so dependent upon particular
circumstances, that it is nearly impossible to classify its methods, or
limit its application.I have little, therefore, to say here, and that touching rather
the omission than the selection of decoration, as far as regards
interior roofing.Whether of timber or stone, roofs are necessarily
divided into surfaces, and ribs or beams;--surfaces, flat or carved;
ribs, traversing these in the directions where main strength is
required; or beams, filling the hollow of the dark gable with the
intricate roof-tree, or supporting the flat ceiling.Wherever the ribs
and beams are simply and unaffectedly arranged, there is no difficulty
about decoration; the beams may be carved, the ribs moulded, and the eye
is satisfied at once; but when the vaulting is unribbed, as in plain
waggon vaults and much excellent early Gothic, or when the ceiling is
flat, it becomes a difficult question how far their services may receive
ornamentation independent of their structure.I have never myself seen a
flat ceiling satisfactorily decorated, except by painting: there is much
good and fanciful panelling in old English domestic architecture, but it
always is in some degree meaningless and mean.The flat ceilings of
Venice, as in the Scuola di San Rocco and Ducal Palace, have in their
vast panellings some of the noblest paintings (on stretched canvas)
which the world possesses: and this is all very well for the ceiling;
but one would rather have the painting in a better place, especially
when the rain soaks through its canvas, as I have seen it doing through
many a noble Tintoret.On the whole, flat ceilings are as much to be
avoided as possible; and, when necessary, perhaps a panelled
ornamentation with rich  patterns is the most satisfying, and
loses least of valuable labor.But I leave the question to the reader's
thought, being myself exceedingly undecided respecting it: except only
touching one point--that a blank ceiling is not to be redeemed by a
decorated ventilator.I have a more confirmed opinion, however, respecting the
decoration of curved surfaces.The majesty of a roof is never, I think,
so great, as when the eye can pass undisturbed over the course of all
its curvatures, and trace the dying of the shadows along its smooth and
sweeping vaults.And I would rather, myself, have a plain ridged Gothic
vault, with all its rough stones visible, to keep the sleet and wind out
of a cathedral aisle, than all the fanning and pendanting and foliation
that ever bewildered Tudor weight.But mosaic or fresco may of course be
used as far as we can afford or obtain them; for these do not break the
curvature.Perhaps the most solemn roofs in the world are the apse
conchas of the Romanesque basilicas, with their golden ground and severe
figures.Exactly opposed to these are the decorations which disturb the
serenity of the curve without giving it interest, like the vulgar
panelling of St.Peter's and the Pantheon; both, I think, in the last
degree detestable.V. As roofs internally may be divided into surfaces and ribs,
externally they may be divided into surfaces, and points, or ridges;
these latter often receiving very bold and distinctive ornament.The
outside surface is of small importance in central Europe, being almost
universally low in <DW72>, and tiled throughout Spain, South France, and
North Italy: of still less importance where it is flat, as a terrace; as
often in South Italy and the East, mingled with low domes: but the
larger Eastern and Arabian domes become elaborate in ornamentation: I
cannot speak of them with confidence; to the mind of an inhabitant of
the north, a roof is a guard against wild weather; not a surface which
is forever to bask in serene heat, and gleam across deserts like a
rising moon.I can only say, that I have never seen any drawing of a
richly decorated Eastern dome that made me desire to see the original.tiles are used in some cases with quaint effect; but I believe the
dignity of the building is always greater when the roof is kept in an
undisturbed mass, opposing itself to the variegation and richness of the
walls.The Italian round tile is itself decoration enough, a deep and
rich fluting, which all artists delight in; this, however, is fitted
exclusively for low pitch of roofs.On steep domestic roofs, there is no
ornament better than may be obtained by merely rounding, or cutting to
an angle, the lower extremities of the flat tiles or shingles, as in
Switzerland: thus the whole surface is covered with an appearance of
scales, a fish-like defence against water, at once perfectly simple,
natural, and effective at any distance; and the best decoration of
sloping stone roofs, as of spires, is a mere copy of this scale armor;
it enriches every one of the spires and pinnacles of the cathedral of
Coutances, and of many Norman and early Gothic buildings.Roofs covered
or edged with lead have often patterns designed upon the lead, gilded
and relieved with some dark color, as on the house of Jaques Coeur at
Bourges; and I imagine the effect of this must have been singularly
delicate and beautiful, but only traces of it now remain.The northern
roofs, however, generally stand in little need of surface decoration,
the eye being drawn to the fantastic ranges of their dormer windows, and
to the finials and fringes on their points and ridges.Whether dormer windows are legitimately to be classed as
decorative features, seems to me to admit of doubt.The northern spire
system is evidently a mere elevation and exaggeration of the domestic
turret with its look-out windows, and one can hardly part with the
grotesque lines of the projections, though nobody is to be expected to
live in the spire: but, at all events, such windows are never to be
allowed in places visibly inaccessible, or on less than a natural and
serviceable scale.Under the general head of roof-ridge and point decoration, we
may include, as above noted, the entire race of fringes, finials, and
crockets.As there is no use in any of these things, and as they are
visible additions and parasitical portions of the structure, more
caution is required in their use than in any other features of ornament,
and the architect and spectator must both be in felicitous humor before
they can be well designed or thoroughly enjoyed.They are generally
most admirable where the grotesque Northern spirit has most power; and I
think there is almost always a certain spirit of playfulness in them,
adverse to the grandest architectural effects, or at least to be kept in
severe subordination to the serener character of the prevalent lines.But as they are opposed to the seriousness of majesty on the one hand,
so they are to the weight of dulness on the other; and I know not any
features which make the contrast between continental domestic
architecture, and our own, more humiliatingly felt, or which give so
sudden a feeling of new life and delight, when we pass from the streets
of London to those of Abbeville or Rouen, as the quaint points and
pinnacles of the roof gables and turrets.The commonest and heaviest
roof may be redeemed by a spike at the end of it, if it is set on with
any spirit; but the foreign builders have (or had, at least) a peculiar
feeling in this, and gave animation to the whole roof by the fringe of
its back, and the spike on its forehead, so that all goes together, like
the dorsal fins and spines of a fish: but our spikes have a dull,
screwed on, look; a far-off relationship to the nuts of machinery; and
our roof fringes are sure to look like fenders, as if they were meant to
catch ashes out of the London smoke-clouds.Stone finials and crockets are, I think, to be considered in
architecture, what points and flashes of light are in the color of
painting, or of nature.There are some landscapes whose best character
is sparkling, and there is a possibility of repose in the midst of
brilliancy, or embracing it,--as on the fields of summer sea, or summer
land:

  "Calm, and deep peace, on this high wold,
   And on the dews that drench the furze,
   And on the silvery gossamers,
   _That twinkle into green and gold_."And there are colorists who can keep their quiet in the midst of a
jewellery of light; but, for the most part, it is better to avoid
breaking up either lines or masses by too many points, and to make the
few points used exceedingly precious.So the best crockets and finials
are set, like stars, along the lines, and at the points, which they
adorn, with considerable intervals between them, and exquisite delicacy
and fancy of sculpture in their own designs; if very small, they may
become more frequent, and describe lines by a chain of points; but their
whole value is lost if they are gathered into bunches or clustered into
tassels and knots; and an over-indulgence in them always marks lowness
of school.In Venice, the addition of the finial to the arch-head is the
first sign of degradation; all her best architecture is entirely without
either crockets or finials; and her ecclesiastical architecture may be
classed, with fearless accuracy, as better or worse, in proportion to
the diminution or expansion of the crocket.The absolutely perfect use
of the crocket is found, I think, in the tower of Giotto, and in some
other buildings of the Pisan school.In the North they generally err on
one side or other, and are either florid and huge, or mean in outline,
looking as if they had been pinched out of the stonework, as throughout
the entire cathedral of Amiens; and are besides connected with the
generally spotty system which has been spoken of under the head of
archivolt decoration.X. Employed, however, in moderation, they are among the most
delightful means of delicate expression; and the architect has more
liberty in their individual treatment than in any other feature of the
building.Separated entirely from the structural system, they are
subjected to no shadow of any other laws than those of grace and
chastity; and the fancy may range without rebuke, for materials of their
design, through the whole field of the visible or imaginable creation.The reader has decorated but little
for himself as yet; but I have not, at least, attempted to bias his
judgment.Of the simple forms of decoration which have been set before
him, he has always been left free to choose; and the stated restrictions
in the methods of applying them have been only those which followed on
the necessities of construction previously determined.These having been
now defined, I do indeed leave my reader free to build; and with what a
freedom!All the lovely forms of the universe set before him, whence to
choose, and all the lovely lines that bound their substance or guide
their motion; and of all these lines,--and there are myriads of myriads
in every bank of grass and every tuft of forest; and groups of them
divinely harmonized, in the bell of every flower, and in every several
member of bird and beast,--of all these lines, for the principal forms
of the most important members of architecture, I have used but Three!What, therefore, must be the infinity of the treasure in them all!There
is material enough in a single flower for the ornament of a score of
cathedrals, but suppose we were satisfied with less exhaustive
appliance, and built a score of cathedrals, each to illustrate a single
flower?that would be better than trying to invent new styles, I think.There is quite difference of style enough, between a violet and a
harebell, for all reasonable purposes.Perhaps, however, even more strange than the struggle of our
architects to invent new styles, is the way they commonly speak of this
treasure of natural infinity.Let us take our patience to us for an
instant, and hear one of them, not among the least intelligent:--

  "It is not true that all natural forms are beautiful.We may hardly
  be able to detect this in Nature herself; but when the forms are
  separated from the things, and exhibited alone (by sculpture or
  carving), we then see that they are not all fitted for ornamental
  purposes; and indeed that very few, perhaps none, are so fitted
  without correction.Yes, I say _correction_, for though it is the
  highest aim of every art to imitate nature, this is not to be done by
  imitating any natural form, but by _criticising_ and _correcting_
  it,--criticising it by Nature's rules gathered from all her works,
  but never completely carried out by her in any one work; correcting
  it, by rendering it more natural, _i.e._ more conformable to the
  general tendency of Nature, according to that noble maxim recorded of
  Raffaelle, 'that the artist's object was to make things not as Nature
  makes them, but as she WOULD make them;' as she ever tries to make
  them, but never succeeds, though her aim may be deduced from a
  comparison of her efforts; just as if a number of archers had aimed
  unsuccessfully at a mark upon a wall, and this mark were then
  removed, we could by the examination of their arrow marks point out
  the most probable position of the spot aimed at, with a certainty of
  being nearer to it than any of their shots.I had thought that, by this time, we had done with that stale,
second-hand, one-sided, and misunderstood saying of Raffaelle's; or that
at least, in these days of purer Christian light, men might have begun
to get some insight into the meaning of it: Raffaelle was a painter of
humanity, and assuredly there is something the matter with humanity, a
few _dovrebbe's_, more or less, wanting in it.We have most of us heard
of original sin, and may perhaps, in our modest moments, conjecture that
we are not quite what God, or nature, would have us to be.Raffaelle
_had_ something to mend in Humanity: I should have liked to have seen
him mending a daisy!--or a pease-blossom, or a moth, or a mustard seed,
or any other of God's slightest works.If he had accomplished that, one
might have found for him more respectable employment,--to set the stars
in better order, perhaps (they seem grievously scattered as they are,
and to be of all manner of shapes and sizes,--except the ideal shape,
and the proper size); or to give us a corrected view of the ocean; that,
at least, seems a very irregular and improveable thing; the very
fishermen do not know, this day, how far it will reach, driven up before
the west wind:--perhaps Some One else does, but that is not our
business.Let us go down and stand by the beach of it,--of the great
irregular sea, and count whether the thunder of it is not out of time.One,--two:--here comes a well-formed wave at last, trembling a little at
the top, but, on the whole, orderly.So, crash among the shingle, and up
as far as this grey pebble; now stand by and watch!Another:--Ah,
careless wave!why couldn't you have kept your crest on?it is all gone
away into spray, striking up against the cliffs there--I thought as
much--missed the mark by a couple of feet!Another:--How now, impatient
one!couldn't you have waited till your friend's reflux was done with,
instead of rolling yourself up with it in that unseemly manner?A fourth, and a goodly one at last.What think we of yonder
slow rise, and crystalline hollow, without a flaw?Steady, good wave;
not so fast; not so fast; where are you coming to?--By our architectural
word, this is too bad; two yards over the mark, and ever so much of you
in our face besides; and a wave which we had some hope of, behind there,
broken all to pieces out at sea, and laying a great white table-cloth of
foam all the way to the shore, as if the marine gods were to dine off
it!Alas, for these unhappy arrow shots of Nature; she will never hit
her mark with those unruly waves of hers, nor get one of them, into the
ideal shape, if we wait for a thousand years.Let us send for a Greek
architect to do it for her.He comes--the great Greek architect, with
measure and rule.Will he not also make the weight for the winds?and
weigh out the waters by measure?and make a decree for the rain, and a
way for the lightning of the thunder?He sets himself orderly to his
work, and behold!this is the mark of nature, and this is the thing into
which the great Greek architect improves the sea--

[Greek: Thalatta, thalatta]: Was it this, then, that they wept to see
from the sacred mountain--those wearied ones?Yes, and were not also
the leaves, and the blades of grass; and, in a sort, as far as may be
without mark of sin, even the countenance of man?Or would it be
pleasanter and better to have us all alike, and numbered on our
foreheads, that we might be known one from the other?V. Is there, then, nothing to be done by man's art?Have we only to
copy, and again copy, for ever, the imagery of the universe?We
have work to do upon it; there is not any one of us so simple, nor so
feeble, but he has work to do upon it.But the work is not to improve,
but to explain.This infinite universe is unfathomable, inconceivable,
in its whole; every human creature must slowly spell out, and long
contemplate, such part of it as may be possible for him to reach; then
set forth what he has learned of it for those beneath him; extricating
it from infinity, as one gathers a violet out of grass; one does not
improve either violet or grass in gathering it, but one makes the flower
visible; and then the human being has to make its power upon his own
heart visible also, and to give it the honor of the good thoughts it has
raised up in him, and to write upon it the history of his own soul.And
sometimes he may be able to do more than this, and to set it in strange
lights, and display it in a thousand ways before unknown: ways specially
directed to necessary and noble purposes, for which he had to choose
instruments out of the wide armory of God.All this he may do: and in
this he is only doing what every Christian has to do with the written,
as well as the created word, "rightly _dividing_ the word of truth."Out
of the infinity of the written word, he has also to gather and set forth
things new and old, to choose them for the season and the work that are
before him, to explain and manifest them to others, with such
illustration and enforcement as may be in his power, and to crown them
with the history of what, by them, God has done for his soul.And, in
doing this, is he improving the Word of God?Just such difference as
there is between the sense in which a minister may be said to improve a
text, to the people's comfort, and the sense in which an atheist might
declare that he could improve the Book, which, if any man shall add
unto, there shall be added unto him the plagues that are written
therein; just such difference is there between that which, with respect
to Nature, man is, in his humbleness, called upon to do, and that which,
in his insolence, he imagines himself capable of doing.Have no fear, therefore, reader, in judging between nature and
art, so only that you love both.If you can love one only, then let it
be Nature; you are safe with her: but do not then attempt to judge the
art, to which you do not care to give thought, or time.But if you love
both, you may judge between them fearlessly; you may estimate the last,
by its making you remember the first, and giving you the same kind of
joy.If, in the square of the city, you can find a delight, finite,
indeed, but pure and intense, like that which you have in a valley among
the hills, then its art and architecture are right; but if, after fair
trial, you can find no delight in them, nor any instruction like that of
nature, I call on you fearlessly to condemn them.We are forced, for the sake of accumulating our power and knowledge, to
live in cities; but such advantage as we have in association with each
other is in great part counterbalanced by our loss of fellowship with
nature.We cannot all have our gardens now, nor our pleasant fields to
meditate in at eventide.Then the function of our architecture is, as
far as may be, to replace these; to tell us about nature; to possess us
with memories of her quietness; to be solemn and full of tenderness,
like her, and rich in portraitures of her; full of delicate imagery of
the flowers we can no more gather, and of the living creatures now far
away from us in their own solitude.If ever you felt or found this in a
London Street,--if ever it furnished you with one serious thought, or
one ray of true and gentle pleasure,--if there is in your heart a true
delight in its grim railings and dark casements, and wasteful finery of
shops, and feeble coxcombry of club-houses,--it is well: promote the
building of more like them.But if they never taught you anything, and
never made you happier as you passed beneath them, do not think they
have any mysterious goodness nor occult sublimity.Have done with the
wretched affectation, the futile barbarism, of pretending to enjoy: for,
as surely as you know that the meadow grass, meshed with fairy rings, is
better than the wood pavement, cut into hexagons; and as surely as you
know the fresh winds and sunshine of the upland are better than the
choke-damp of the vault, or the gas-light of the ball-room, you may
know, as I told you that you should, that the good architecture, which
has life, and truth, and joy in it, is better than the bad architecture,
which has death, dishonesty, and vexation of heart in it, from the
beginning to the end of time.And now come with me, for I have kept you too long from your
gondola: come with me, on an autumnal morning, through the dark gates of
Padua, and let us take the broad road leading towards the East.It lies level, for a league or two, between its elms, and vine festoons
full laden, their thin leaves veined into scarlet hectic, and their
clusters deepened into gloomy blue; then mounts an embankment above the
Brenta, and runs between the river and the broad plain, which stretches
to the north in endless lines of mulberry and maize.The Brenta flows
slowly, but strongly; a muddy volume of yellowish-grey water, that
neither hastens nor slackens, but glides heavily between its monotonous
banks, with here and there a short, babbling eddy twisted for an instant
into its opaque surface, and vanishing, as if something had been dragged
into it and gone down.Dusty and shadeless, the road fares along the
<DW18> on its northern side; and the tall white tower of Dolo is seen
trembling in the heat mist far away, and never seems nearer than it did
at first.Presently you pass one of the much vaunted "villas on the
Brenta:" a glaring, spectral shell of brick and stucco, its windows with
painted architraves like picture-frames, and a court-yard paved with
pebbles in front of it, all burning in the thick glow of the feverish
sunshine, but fenced from the high road, for magnificence sake, with
goodly posts and chains; then another, of Kew Gothic, with Chinese
variations, painted red and green; a third composed for the greater
part of dead-wall, with fictitious windows painted upon it, each with a
pea-green blind, and a classical architrave in bad perspective; and a
fourth, with stucco figures set on the top of its garden-wall: some
antique, like the kind to be seen at the corner of the New Road, and
some of clumsy grotesque dwarfs, with fat bodies and large boots.This
is the architecture to which her studies of the Renaissance have
conducted modern Italy.The sun climbs steadily, and warms into intense white the walls
of the little piazza of Dolo, where we change horses.Another dreary
stage among the now divided branches of the Brenta, forming irregular
and half-stagnant canals; with one or two more villas on the other side
of them, but these of the old Venetian type, which we may have
recognised before at Padua, and sinking fast into utter ruin, black, and
rent, and lonely, set close to the edge of the dull water, with what
were once small gardens beside them, kneaded into mud, and with blighted
fragments of gnarled hedges and broken stakes for their fencing; and
here and there a few fragments of marble steps, which have once given
them graceful access from the water's edge, now settling into the mud in
broken joints, all aslope, and slippery with green weed.At last the
road turns sharply to the north, and there is an open space, covered
with bent grass, on the right of it: but do not look that way.Five minutes more, and we are in the upper room of the little
inn at Mestre, glad of a moment's rest in shade.The table is (always, I
think) covered with a cloth of nominal white and perennial grey, with
plates and glasses at due intervals, and small loaves of a peculiar
white bread, made with oil, and more like knots of flour than bread.The
view from its balcony is not cheerful: a narrow street, with a solitary
brick church and barren campanile on the other side of it; and some
coventual buildings, with a few crimson remnants of fresco about their
windows; and, between them and the street, a ditch with some slow
current in it, and one or two small houses beside it, one with an arbor
of roses at its door, as in an English tea-garden; the air, however,
about us having in it nothing of roses, but a close smell of garlic and
crabs, warmed by the smoke of various stands of hot chestnuts.There is
much vociferation also going on beneath the window respecting certain
wheelbarrows which are in rivalry for our baggage: we appease their
rivalry with our best patience, and follow them down the narrow street.X. We have but walked some two hundred yards when we come to a low
wharf or quay, at the extremity of a canal, with long steps on each side
down to the water, which latter we fancy for an instant has become black
with stagnation; another glance undeceives us,--it is covered with the
black boats of Venice.We enter one of them, rather to try if they be
real boats or not, than with any definite purpose, and glide away; at
first feeling as if the water were yielding continually beneath the boat
and letting her sink into soft vacancy.It is something clearer than any
water we have seen lately, and of a pale green; the banks only two or
three feet above it, of mud and rank grass, with here and there a
stunted tree; gliding swiftly past the small casement of the gondola, as
if they were dragged by upon a painted scene.Stroke by stroke we count the plunges of the oar, each heaving up the
side of the boat slightly as her silver beak shoots forward.We lose
patience, and extricate ourselves from the cushions: the sea air blows
keenly by, as we stand leaning on the roof of the floating cell.In
front, nothing to be seen but long canal and level bank; to the west,
the tower of Mestre is lowering fast, and behind it there have risen
purple shapes, of the color of dead rose-leaves, all round the horizon,
feebly defined against the afternoon sky,--the Alps of Bassano.Forward
still: the endless canal bends at last, and then breaks into intricate
angles about some low bastions, now torn to pieces and staggering in
ugly rents towards the water,--the bastions of the fort of Malghera.Another turn, and another perspective of canal; but not interminable.The silver beak cleaves it fast,--it widens: the rank grass of the
banks sinks lower, and lower, and at last dies in tawny knots along an
expanse of weedy shore.Over it, on the right, but a few years back, we
might have seen the lagoon stretching to the horizon, and the warm
southern sky bending over Malamocco to the sea.Now we can see nothing
but what seems a low and monotonous dock-yard wall, with flat arches to
let the tide through it;--this is the railroad bridge, conspicuous above
all things.But at the end of those dismal arches, there rises, out of
the wide water, a straggling line of low and confused brick buildings,
which, but for the many towers which are mingled among them, might be
the suburbs of an English manufacturing town.Four or five domes, pale,
and apparently at a greater distance, rise over the centre of the line;
but the object which first catches the eye is a sullen cloud of black
smoke brooding over the northern half of it, and which issues from the
belfry of a church.FOOTNOTES:

  [92] Garbett on Design, p.I find the chroniclers agree in fixing the year 421, if any: the
following sentence from De Monaci may perhaps interest the reader."God, who punishes the sins of men by war sorrows, and whose ways are
past finding out, willing both to save the innocent blood, and that a
great power, beneficial to the whole world, should arise in a spot
strange beyond belief, moved the chief men of the cities of the Venetian
province (which from the border of Pannonia, extended as far as the
Adda, a river of Lombardy), both in memory of past, and in dread of
future distress, to establish states upon the nearer islands of the
inner gulphs of the Adriatic, to which, in the last necessity, they
might retreat for refuge.And first Galienus de Fontana, Simon de
Glauconibus, and Antonius Calvus, or, as others have it, Adalburtus
Falerius, Thomas Candiano, Comes Daulus, Consuls of Padua, by the
command of their King and the desire of the citizens, laid the
foundations of the new commonwealth, under good auspices, on the island
of the Rialto, the highest and nearest to the mouth of the deep river
now called the Brenta, in the year of Our Lord, as many writers assure
us, four hundred and twenty-one, on the 25th day of March."[93]

It is matter also of very great satisfaction to know that Venice was
founded by good Christians: "La qual citade e stada hedificada da veri e
boni Christiani:" which information I found in the MS.copy of the
Zancarol Chronicle, in the library of St.Finally the conjecture as to the origin of her name, recorded by
Sansovino, will be accepted willingly by all who love Venice: "Fu
interpretato da alcuni, che questa voce VENETIA voglia dire _VENI
ETIAM_, cioe, vieni ancora, e ancora, percioche quante volte verrai,
sempre vedrai nuove cose, enuove bellezze."The best authorities agree in giving the year 697 as that of the
election of the first doge, Paul Luke Anafeste.He was elected in a
general meeting of the commonalty, tribunes, and clergy, at Heraclea,
"divinis rebus procuratis," as usual, in all serious work, in those
times.His authority is thus defined by Sabellico, who was not likely to
have exaggerated it:--"Penes quem decus omne imperii ac majestas esset:
cui jus concilium cogendi quoties de republica aliquid referri
oporteret; qui tribunos annuos in singulas insulas legeret, a quibus ad
Ducem esset provocatio.Caeterum, si quis dignitatem, ecclesiam,
sacerdotumve cleri populique suffragio esset adeptus, ita demum id ratum
haberetur si dux ipse auctor factus esset."The last clause is
very important, indicating the subjection of the ecclesiastical to the
popular and ducal (or patrician) powers, which, throughout her career,
was one of the most remarkable features in the policy of Venice.The
appeal from the tribunes to the doge is also important; and the
expression "decus omne imperii," if of somewhat doubtful force, is at
least as energetic as could have been expected from an historian under
the influence of the Council of Ten.The date of the decree which made the right of sitting in the grand
council hereditary, is variously given; the Venetian historians
themselves saying as little as they can about it.The thing was
evidently not accomplished at once, several decrees following in
successive years: the Council of Ten was established without any doubt
in 1310, in consequence of the conspiracy of Tiepolo.The Venetian
verse, quoted by Mutinelli (Annali Urbani di Venezia, p."Del mille tresento e diese
   A mezzo el mese delle ceriese
   Bagiamonte passo el ponte
   E per esso fo fatto el Consegio di diese."The reader cannot do better than take 1297 as the date of the beginning
of the change of government, and this will enable him exactly to divide
the 1100 years from the election of the first doge into 600 of monarchy
and 500 of aristocracy.The coincidence of the numbers is somewhat
curious; 697 the date of the establishment of the government, 1297 of
its change, and 1797 of its fall.S. PIETRO DI CASTELLO.It is credibly reported to have been founded in the seventh century, and
(with somewhat less of credibility) in a place where the Trojans,
conducted by Antenor, had, after the destruction of Troy, built "un
castello, chiamato prima Troja, poscia Olivolo, interpretato, luogo
pieno."Peter appeared in person to the Bishop of
Heraclea, and commanded him to found in his honor, a church in that spot
of the rising city on the Rialto: "ove avesse veduto una mandra di buoi
e di pecore pascolare unitamente.Questa fu la prodigiosa origine della
Chiesa di San Pietro, che poscia, o rinovata, o ristaurata, da Orso
Participazio IV Vescovo Olivolense, divenne la Cattedrale della Nuova
citta."(Notizie Storiche delle Chiese e Monasteri di Venezia.What there was so prodigious in oxen and sheep feeding together,
we need St.The title of Bishop of Castello
was first taken in 1091: St.Mark's was not made the cathedral church
till 1807.It may be thought hardly fair to conclude the small
importance of the old St.Pietro di Castello from the appearance of the
wretched modernisations of 1620.But these modernisations are spoken of
as improvements; and I find no notice of peculiar beauties in the older
building, either in the work above quoted, or by Sansovino; who only
says that when it was destroyed by fire (as everything in Venice was, I
think, about three times in a century), in the reign of Vital Michele,
it was rebuilt "with good thick walls, maintaining, _for all that_, the
order of its arrangement taken from the Greek mode of building."This
does not seem the description of a very enthusiastic effort to rebuild a
highly ornate cathedral.The present church is among the least
interesting in Venice; a wooden bridge, something like that of Battersea
on a small scale, connects its island, now almost deserted, with a
wretched suburb of the city behind the arsenal; and a blank level of
lifeless grass, rotted away in places rather than trodden, is extended
before its mildewed facade and solitary tower.I may refer the reader to the eleventh chapter of the twenty-eighth book
of Daru for some account of the restraints to which the Venetian clergy
were subjected.I have not myself been able to devote any time to the
examination of the original documents bearing on this matter, but the
following extract from a letter of a friend, who will not at present
permit me to give his name, but who is certainly better conversant
with the records of the Venetian State than any other Englishman, will
be of great value to the general reader:--

"In the year 1410, or perhaps at the close of the thirteenth century,
churchmen were excluded from the Grand Council and declared ineligible
to civil employment; and in the same year, 1410, the Council of Ten,
with the Giunta, decreed that whenever in the state's councils matters
concerning ecclesiastical affairs were being treated, all the kinsfolk
of Venetian beneficed clergymen were to be expelled; and, in the year
1434, the RELATIONS of churchmen were declared ineligible to the post of
ambassador at Rome."The Venetians never gave possession of any see in their territories to
bishops unless they had been proposed to the pope by the senate, which
elected the patriarch, who was supposed, at the end of the sixteenth
century, to be liable to examination by his Holiness, as an act of
confirmation of installation; but of course, everything depended on the
relative power at any given time of Rome and Venice: for instance, a few
days after the accession of Julius II., in 1503, he requests the
Signory, cap in hand, to ALLOW him to confer the archbishopric of Zara
on a dependant of his, one Cipico the Bishop of Famagosta.Six years
later, when Venice was overwhelmed by the leaguers of Cambrai, that
furious pope would assuredly have conferred Zara on Cipico WITHOUT
asking leave.In 1608, the rich Camaldolite Abbey of Vangadizza, in the
Polesine, fell vacant through the death of Lionardo Loredano, in whose
family it had been since some while.The Venetian ambassador at Rome
received the news on the night of the 28th December; and, on the morrow,
requested Paul IV.not to dispose of this preferment until he heard from
the senate.The pope talked of 'poor cardinals' and of his nephew, but
made no positive reply; and, as Francesco Contarini was withdrawing,
said to him: 'My Lord ambassador, with this opportunity we will inform
you that, to our very great regret, we understand that the chiefs of the
Ten mean to turn sacristans; for they order the parish priests to close
the church doors at the Ave Maria, and not to ring the bells at certain
hours.This is precisely the sacristan's office; we don't know why their
lordships, by printed edicts, which we have seen, choose to interfere in
this matter.This is pure and mere ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and
even, in case of any inconvenience arising, is there not the patriarch,
who is at any rate your own; why not apply to him, who could remedy
these irregularities?These are matters which cause us very notable
displeasure; we say so that they may be written and known: it is decided
by the councils and canons, and not uttered by us, that whosoever forms
any resolve against the ecclesiastical liberty, cannot do so without
incurring censure: and in order that Father Paul [Bacon's correspondent]
may not say hereafter, as he did in his past writings, that our
predecessors assented either tacitly or by permission, we declare that
we do not give our assent, nor do we approve it; nay, we blame it, and
let this be announced in Venice, so that, for the rest, every one may
take care of his own conscience.Thomas a Becket, whose festival is
celebrated this very day, suffered martyrdom for the ecclesiastical
liberty; it is our duty likewise to support and defend it.'Contarini
says: 'This remonstrance was delivered with some marks of anger, which
induced me to tell him how the tribunal of the most excellent the Lords
chiefs of the Ten is in our country supreme; that it does not do its
business unadvisedly, or condescend to unworthy matters; and that,
therefore, should those Lords have come to any public declaration of
their will, it must be attributed to orders anterior, and to immemorial
custom and authority, recollecting that, on former occasions likewise,
similar commissions were given to prevent divers incongruities;
wherefore an upright intention, such as this, ought not to be taken in
any other sense than its own, especially as the parishes of Venice were
in her own gift,' &c.&c. The pope persisted in bestowing the abbacy on
his nephew, but the republic would not give possession, and a compromise
was effected by its being conferred on the Venetian Matteo Priuli, who
allowed the cardinal five thousand ducats per annum out of its revenues.A few years before this, this very same pope excommunicated the State,
because she had imprisoned two churchmen for heinous crimes; the strife
lasted for more than a year, and ended through the mediation of Henry
IV., at whose suit the prisoners were delivered to the French
ambassador, who made them over to a papal commissioner."In January, 1484, a tournament was in preparation on St.Mark's Square:
some murmurs had been heard about the distribution of the prizes having
been pre-arranged, without regard to the 'best man.'One of the chiefs
of the Ten was walking along Rialto on the 28th January, when a young
priest, twenty-two years old, a sword-cutlers son, and a Bolognese, and
one of Perugia, both men-at-arms under Robert Sansoverino, fell upon a
clothier with drawn weapons.The chief of the Ten desired they might be
seized, but at the moment the priest escaped; he was, however,
subsequently retaken, and in that very evening hanged by torch-light
between the columns with the two soldiers.; Venice weaker in 1605 than in 1484."* * * The exclusion from the Grand Council, whether at the end of the
fourteenth or commencement of the following century, of the Venetian
ecclesiastics, (as induced either by the republic's acquisitions on the
main land then made, and which, through the rich benefices they
embraced, might have rendered an ambitious churchman as dangerous in the
Grand Council as a victorious condottiere; or from dread of their
allegiance being divided between the church and their country, it being
acknowledged that no man can serve two masters,) did not render them
hostile to their fatherland, whose interests were, with very few
exceptions, eagerly fathered by the Venetian prelates at Rome, who, in
their turn, received all honor at Venice, where state receptions given
to cardinals of the houses of Correr, Grimani, Cornaro, Pisani,
Contarini, Zeno, Delfino, and others, vouch for the good understanding
that existed between the 'Papalists' and their countrymen.The Cardinal
Grimani was instrumental in detaching Julius II.from the league of
Cambrai; the Cardinal Cornaro always aided the state to obtain anything
required of Leo X.; and, both before and after their times, all
Venetians that had a seat in the Sacred College were patriots rather
than pluralists: I mean that they cared more for Venice than for their
benefices, admitting thus the soundness of that policy which denied them
admission into the Grand Council."To this interesting statement, I shall add, from the twenty-eighth book
of Daru, two passages, well deserving consideration by us English in
present days:

"Pour etre parfaitement assuree contre les envahissements de la
puissance ecclesiastique, Venise commenca par lui oter tout pretexte
d'intervenir dans les affaires de l'Etat; elle resta invariablement
fidele au dogme.Jamais aucune des opinions nouvelles n'y prit la
moindre faveur; jamais aucun heresiarque ne sortit de Venise.Les
conciles, les disputes, les guerres de religion, se passerent sans
qu'elle y prit jamais la moindre part.Inebranlable dans sa foi, elle ne
fut pas moins invariable dans son systeme de tolerance.Non seulement
ses sujets de la religion grecque conserverent l'exercise de leur culte,
leurs eveques et leurs pretres; mais les Protestantes, les Armeniens,
les Mahomitans, les Juifs, toutes les religions, toutes les sectes qui
se trouvaient dans Venise, avaient des temples, et la sepulture dans les
eglises n'etait point refuse aux heretiques.Une police vigilante
s'appliquait avec le meme soin a eteindre les discordes, et a empecher
les fanatiques et les novateurs de troubler l'Etat."*       *       *       *       *

"Si on considere que c'est dans un temps ou presque toutes les nations
tremblaient devant la puissance pontificale, que les Venitiens surent
tenir leur clerge dans la dependance, et braver souvent les censures
ecclesiastiques et les interdits, sans encourir jamais aucun reproche
sur la purete de leur foi, on sera force de reconnaitre que cette
republique avait devance de loin les autres peuples dans cette partie de
la science du gouvernement.La fameuse maxime, 'Siamo veneziani, poi
christiani,' n'etait qu'une formule energique qui ne prouvait point
quils voulussent placer l'interet de la religion apres celui de l'Etat,
mais qui annoncait leur invariable resolution de ne pas souffrir qu'un
pouvoir etranger portat atteinte aux droits de la republique."Dans toute la duree de son existence, an milieu des revers comme dans
la prosperite cet inebranlable gouvernement ne fit qu'une seule fois des
concessions a la cour de Borne, et ce fut pour detacher le Pape Jules
II."Jamais il ne se relacha du soin de tenir le clerge dans une nullite
absolue relativement aux affaires politiques; on peut en juger par la
conduite qu'il tint avec l'ordre religieux le plus redoutable et le plus
accoutume a s'immiscer dans les secrets de l'Etat et dans les interets
temporels."The main points, next stated, respecting the Jesuits are, that the
decree which permitted their establishment in Venice required formal
renewal every three years; that no Jesuit could stay in Venice more than
three years; that the slightest disobedience to the authority of the
government was instantly punished by imprisonment; that no Venetian
could enter the order without express permission from the government;
that the notaries were forbidden to sanction any testamentary disposal
of property to the Jesuits; finally, that the heads of noble families
were forbidden to permit their children to be educated in the Jesuits'
colleges, on pain of degradation from their rank.Now, let it be observed that the enforcement of absolute exclusion of
the clergy from the councils of the state, dates exactly from the period
which I have marked for the commencement of the decline of the Venetian
power.The Romanist is welcome to his advantage in this fact, if
advantage it be; for I do not bring forward the conduct of the senate of
Venice, as Daru does, by way of an example of the general science of
government.The Venetians accomplished therein what we ridiculously call
a separation of "Church and State" (as if the State were not, in all
Christendom, necessarily also the Church[94]), but _ought_ to call a
separation of lay and clerical officers.I do not point out this
separation as subject of praise, but as the witness borne by the
Venetians against the principles of the Papacy.If they were to blame,
in yielding to their fear of the ambitious spirit of Rome so far as to
deprive their councils of all religious element, what excuse are we to
offer for the state, which, with Lords Spiritual of her own faith
already in her senate, permits the polity of Rome to be represented by
lay members?To have sacrificed religion to mistaken policy, or
purchased security with ignominy, would have been no new thing in the
world's history; but to be at once impious and impolitic, and seek for
danger through dishonor, was reserved for the English parliament of
1829.I am glad to have this opportunity of referring to, and farther
enforcing, the note on this subject which, not without deliberation, I
appended to the "Seven Lamps;" and of adding to it the following
passage, written by my father in the year 1839, and published in one of
the journals of that year:--a passage remarkable as much for its
intrinsic value, as for having stated, twelve years ago, truths to which
the mind of England seems but now, and that slowly, awakening."We hear it said, that it cannot be merely the Roman religion that
causes the difficulty [respecting Ireland], for we were once all Roman
Catholics, and nations abroad of this faith are not as the Irish.It is
totally overlooked, that when we were so, our government was despotic,
and fit to cope with this dangerous religion, as most of the Continental
governments yet are.In what Roman Catholic state, or in what age of
Roman Catholic England, did we ever hear of such agitation as now exists
in Ireland by evil men taking advantage of an anomalous state of
things--Roman Catholic ignorance in the people, Protestant toleration in
the government?We have yet to feel the tremendous difficulty in which
Roman Catholic emancipation has involved us.Too late we discover that a
Roman Catholic is wholly incapable of being safely connected with the
British constitution, as it now exists, _in any near relation_.The
present constitution is no longer fit for Catholics.It is a creature
essentially Protestant, growing with the growth, and strengthening with
the strength, of Protestantism.So entirely is Protestantism interwoven
with the whole frame of our constitution and laws, that I take my stand
on this, against all agitators in existence, that the Roman religion is
totally incompatible with the British constitution.We have, in trying
to combine them, got into a maze of difficulties; we are the worse, and
Ireland none the better.It is idle to talk of municipal reform or
popular Lords Lieutenant.The mild sway of a constitutional monarchy is
not strong enough for a Roman Catholic population.The stern soul of a
Republican would not shrink from sending half the misguided population
and all the priests into exile, and planting in their place an
industrious Protestant people.But you cannot do this, and you cannot
convert the Irish, nor by other means make them fit to wear the mild
restraints of a Protestant Government.It was, moreover, a strange logic
that begot the idea of admitting Catholics to administer any part of our
laws or constitution.It was admitted by all that, by the very act of
abandoning the Roman religion, we became a free and enlightened people.It was only by throwing off the yoke of that slavish religion that we
attained to the freedom of thought which has advanced us in the scale of
society.We are so much advanced by adopting and adhering to a reformed
religion, that to prove our liberal and unprejudiced views, we throw
down the barriers betwixt the two religions, of which the one is the
acknowledged cause of light and knowledge, the other the cause of
darkness and ignorance.We are so much altered to the better by leaving
this people entirely, and giving them neither part nor lot amongst us,
that it becomes proper to mingle again with them.We have found so much
good in leaving them, that we deem it the best possible reason for
returning to be among them.No fear of their Church again shaking us,
with all our light and knowledge.It is true, the most enlightened
nations fell under the spell of her enchantments, fell into total
darkness and superstition; but no fear of us--we are too well informed!I fear me, when the
Roman religion rolled her clouds of darkness over the earlier ages, that
she quenched as much light, and knowledge, and judgment as our modern
Liberals have ever displayed.I do not expect a statesman to discuss the
point of Transubstantiation betwixt Protestant and Catholic, nor to
trace the narrow lines which divide Protestant sectarians from each
other; but can any statesman that shall have taken even a cursory
glance at the face of Europe, hesitate a moment on the choice of the
Protestant religion?If he unfortunately knew nothing of its being the
true one in regard to our eternal interests, he is at least bound to see
whether it be not the best for the worldly prosperity of a people.He
may be but moderately imbued with pious zeal for the salvation of a
kingdom, but at least he will be expected to weigh the comparative
merits of religion, as of law or government; and blind, indeed, must he
be if he does not discern that, in neglecting to cherish the Protestant
faith, or in too easily yielding to any encroachments on it, he is
foregoing the use of a state engine more powerful than all the laws
which the uninspired legislators of the earth have ever promulgated, in
promoting the happiness, the peace, prosperity, and the order, the
industry, and the wealth, of a people; in forming every quality valuable
or desirable in a subject or a citizen; in sustaining the public mind at
that point of education and information that forms the best security for
the state, and the best preservative for the freedom of a people,
whether religious or political."There having been three principal styles of architecture in Venice,--the
Greek or Byzantine, the Gothic, and the Renaissance, it will be shown,
in the sequel, that the Renaissance itself is divided into three
correspondent families: Renaissance engrafted on Byzantine, which is
earliest and best; Renaissance engrafted on Gothic, which is second, and
second best; Renaissance on Renaissance, which is double darkness, and
worst of all.The palaces in which Renaissance is engrafted on Byzantine
are those noticed by Commynes: they are characterized by an
ornamentation very closely resembling, and in some cases identical with,
early Byzantine work; namely, groups of  marble circles inclosed
in interlacing bands.I have put on the opposite page one of these
ornaments, from the Ca' Trevisan, in which a most curious and delicate
piece of inlaid design is introduced into a band which is almost exactly
copied from the church of Theotocos at Constantinople, and correspondent
with others in St.There is also much Byzantine feeling in the
treatment of the animals, especially in the two birds of the lower
compartment, while the peculiar curves of the cinque cento leafage are
visible in the leaves above.The dove, alighted, with the olive-branch
plucked off, is opposed to the raven with restless expanded wings.Beneath are evidently the two sacrifices "of every clean fowl and of
every clean beast."The color is given with green and white marbles, the
dove relieved on a ground of greyish green, and all is exquisitely
finished.13, the upper figure is from the same palace (Ca'
Trevisan), and it is very interesting in its proportions.If we take
five circles in geometrical proportion, each diameter being two-thirds
of the diameter next above it, and arrange the circles so proportioned,
in contact with each other, in the manner shown in the plate, we shall
find that an increase quite imperceptible in the diameter of the circles
in the angles, will enable us to inscribe the whole in a square.The
lines so described will then run in the centre of the white bands.I
cannot be certain that this is the actual construction of the Trevisan
design, because it is on a high wall surface, where I could not get at
its measurements; but I found this construction exactly coincide with
the lines of my eye sketch.The lower figure in Plate I. is from the
front of the Ca' Dario, and probably struck the eye of Commynes in its
first brightness.Salvatico, indeed, considers both the Ca' Trevisan
(which once belonged to Bianca Cappello) and the Ca' Dario, as buildings
of the sixteenth century.I defer the discussion of the question at
present, but have, I believe, sufficient reason for assuming the Ca'
Dario to have been built about 1486, and the Ca' Trevisan not much
later.VARIETIES OF THE ORDERS.Of these phantasms and grotesques, one of some general importance is
that commonly called Ionic, of which the idea was taken (Vitruvius says)
from a woman's hair, curled; but its lateral processes look more like
rams' horns: be that as it may, it is a mere piece of agreeable
extravagance, and if, instead of rams' horns, you put ibex horns, or
cows' horns, or an ass's head at once, you will have ibex orders, or ass
orders, or any number of other orders, one for every head or horn.You
may have heard of another order, the Composite, which is Ionic and
Corinthian mixed, and is one of the worst of ten thousand forms
referable to the Corinthian as their head: it may be described as a
spoiled Corinthian.And you may have also heard of another order, called
Tuscan (which is no order at all, but a spoiled Doric): and of another
called Roman Doric, which is Doric more spoiled, both which are simply
among the most stupid variations ever invented upon forms already known.I find also in a French pamphlet upon architecture,[95] as applied to
shops and dwelling houses, a sixth order, the "Ordre Francais," at least
as good as any of the three last, and to be hailed with acclamation,
considering whence it comes, there being usually more tendency on the
other side of the channel to the confusion of "orders" than their
multiplication: but the reader will find in the end that there are in
very deed only two orders, of which the Greek, Doric, and Corinthian are
the first examples, and _they_ not perfect, nor in anywise sufficiently
representative of the vast families to which they belong; but being the
first and the best known, they may properly be considered as the types
of the rest.The essential distinctions of the two great orders he will
find explained in Secs.XXVII., and in the
passages there referred to; but I should rather desire that these
passages might be read in the order in which they occur.I have sketched above, in the First Chapter, the great events of
architectural history in the simplest and fewest words I could; but this
indraught of the Lombard energies upon the Byzantine rest, like a wild
north wind descending into a space of rarified atmosphere, and
encountered by an Arab simoom from the south, may well require from us
some farther attention; for the differences in all these schools are
more in the degrees of their impetuosity and refinement (these
qualities being, in most cases, in inverse ratio, yet much united by the
Arabs) than in the style of the ornaments they employ.The same leaves,
the same animals, the same arrangement, are used by Scandinavians,
ancient Britons, Saxons, Normans, Lombards, Romans, Byzantines, and
Arabians; all being alike descended through classic Greece from Egypt
and Assyria, and some from Phoenicia.The belts which encompass the
Assyrian bulls, in the hall of the British Museum, are the same as the
belts of the ornaments found in Scandinavian tumuli; their method of
ornamentation is the same as that of the gate of Mycenae, and of the
Lombard pulpit of St.Ambrogio of Milan, and of the church of Theotocos
at Constantinople; the essential differences among the great schools are
their differences of temper and treatment, and science of expression; it
is absurd to talk of Norman ornaments, and Lombard ornaments, and
Byzantine ornaments, as formally distinguished; but there is
irreconcileable separation between Arab temper, and Lombard temper, and
Byzantine temper.Now, as far as I have been able to compare the three schools, it appears
to me that the Arab and Lombard are both distinguished from the
Byzantine by their energy and love of excitement, but the Lombard stands
alone in his love of jest: Neither an Arab nor Byzantine ever jests in
his architecture; the Lombard has great difficulty in ever being
thoroughly serious; thus they represent three conditions of humanity,
one in perfect rest, the Byzantine, with exquisite perception of grace
and dignity; the Arab, with the same perception of grace, but with a
restless fever in his blood; the Lombard, equally energetic, but not
burning himself away, capable of submitting to law, and of enjoying
jest.But the Arabian feverishness infects even the Lombard in the
South, showing itself, however, in endless invention, with a refreshing
firmness and order directing the whole of it.The excitement is greatest
in the earliest times, most of all shown in St.Michele of Pavia; and I
am strongly disposed to connect much of its peculiar manifestations with
the Lombard's habits of eating and drinking, especially his
carnivorousness.The Lombard of early times seems to have been exactly
what a tiger would be, if you could give him love of a joke, vigorous
imagination, strong sense of justice, fear of hell, knowledge of
northern mythology, a stone den, and a mallet and chisel; fancy him
pacing up and down in the said den to digest his dinner, and striking on
the wall, with a new fancy in his head, at every turn, and you have the
Lombardic sculptor.As civilisation increases the supply of vegetables,
and shortens that of wild beasts, the excitement diminishes; it is still
strong in the thirteenth century at Lyons and Rouen; it dies away
gradually in the later Gothic, and is quite extinct in the fifteenth
century.I think I shall best illustrate this general idea by simply copying the
entries in my diary which were written when, after six months' close
study of Byzantine work in Venice, I came again to the Lombard work of
Verona and Pavia.There are some other points alluded to in these
entries not pertaining to the matter immediately in hand; but I have
left them, as they will be of use hereafter.Comparing the arabesque and sculpture of the Duomo here with
St.Mark's, the first thing that strikes one is the low relief, the
second, the greater motion and spirit, with infinitely less grace and
science.With the Byzantine, however rude the cutting, every line is
lovely, and the animals or men are placed in any attitudes which secure
ornamental effect, sometimes impossible ones, always severe, restrained,
or languid.With the Romanesque workmen all the figures show the effort
(often successful) to express energetic action; hunting chiefly, much
fighting, and both spirited; some of the dogs running capitally,
straining to it, and the knights hitting hard, while yet the faces and
drawing are in the last degree barbarous.At Venice all is graceful,
fixed, or languid; the eastern torpor is in every line,--the mark of a
school formed on severe traditions, and keeping to them, and never
likely or desirous to rise beyond them, but with an exquisite sense of
beauty, and much solemn religious faith."If the Greek outer archivolt of St.Mark's is Byzantine, the law is
somewhat broken by its busy domesticity; figures engaged in every trade,
and in the preparation of viands of all kinds; a crowded kind of London
Christmas scene, interleaved (literally) by the superb balls of leafage,
unique in sculpture; but even this is strongly opposed to the wild war
and chase passion of the Lombard.Farther, the Lombard building is as
sharp, precise, and accurate, as that of St.The
Byzantines seem to have been too lazy to put their stones together; and,
in general, my first impression on coming to Verona, after four months
in Venice, is of the exquisitely neat masonry and perfect _feeling_
here; a style of Gothic formed by a combination of Lombard surface
ornament with Pisan Gothic, than which nothing can possibly be more
chaste, pure, or solemn."I have said much of the shafts of the entrance to the crypt of St.Zeno;[96] the following note of the sculptures on the archivolt above
them is to our present purpose:

"It is covered by very light but most effective bas-reliefs of jesting
subject:--two cocks carrying on their shoulders a long staff to which a
fox (?)is tied by the legs, hanging down between them: the strut of the
foremost cock, lifting one leg at right angles to the other, is
delicious.Then a stag hunt, with a centaur horseman drawing a bow; the
arrow has gone clear through the stag's throat, and is sticking there.Several capital hunts with dogs, with fruit trees between, and birds in
them; the leaves, considering the early time, singularly well set, with
the edges outwards, sharp, and deep cut: snails and frogs filling up the
intervals, as if suspended in the air, with some saucy puppies on their
hind legs, two or three nondescript beasts; and, finally, on the centre
of one of the arches on the south side, an elephant and castle,--a very
strange elephant, yet cut as if the carver had seen one."Observe this elephant and castle; we shall meet with him farther north.Zeno are, however, quite quiet and tame
compared with those of St.Michele of Pavia, which are designed also in
a somewhat gloomier mood; significative, as I think, of indigestion.(Note that they are much earlier than St.Zeno; of the seventh century
at latest.There is more of nightmare, and less of wit in them.)Lord
Lindsay has described them admirably, but has not said half enough; the
state of mind represented by the west front is more that of a feverish
dream, than resultant from any determined architectural purpose, or even
from any definite love and delight in the grotesque.One capital is
covered with a mass of grinning heads, other heads grow out of two
bodies, or out of and under feet; the creatures are all fighting, or
devouring, or struggling which shall be uppermost, and yet in an
ineffectual way, as if they would fight for ever, and come to no
decision.Neither sphinxes nor centaurs did I notice, nor a single
peacock (I believe peacocks to be purely Byzantine), but mermaids with
_two_ tails (the sculptor having perhaps seen double at the time),
strange, large fish, apes, stags (bulls?), dogs, wolves, and horses,
griffins, eagles, long-tailed birds (cocks?), hawks, and dragons,
without end, or with a dozen of ends, as the case may be; smaller birds,
with rabbits, and small nondescripts, filling the friezes.The actual
leaf, which is used in the best Byzantine mouldings at Venice, occurs in
parts of these Pavian designs.But the Lombard animals are all _alive_,
and fiercely alive too, all impatience and spring: the Byzantine birds
peck idly at the fruit, and the animals hardly touch it with their
noses.The cinque cento birds in Venice hold it up daintily, like
train-bearers; the birds in the earlier Gothic peck at it hungrily and
naturally; but the Lombard beasts gripe at it like tigers, and tear it
off with writhing lips and glaring eyes.They are exactly like Jip with
the bit of geranium, worrying imaginary cats in it."The notice of the leaf in the above extract is important,--it is the
vine-leaf; used constantly both by Byzantines and Lombards, but by the
latter with especial frequency, though at this time they were hardly
able to indicate what they meant.It forms the most remarkable
generality of the St.Michele decoration; though, had it not luckily
been carved on the facade, twining round a stake, and with grapes, I
should never have known what it was meant for, its general form being a
succession of sharp lobes, with incised furrows to the point of each.But it is thrown about in endless change; four or five varieties of it
might be found on every cluster of capitals: and not content with this,
the Lombards hint the same form even in their griffin wings.Michele of Lucca we have perhaps the noblest instance in Italy of
the Lombard spirit in its later refinement.It is some four centuries
later than St.Michele of Pavia, and the method of workmanship is
altogether different.In the Pavian church, nearly all the ornament is
cut in a coarse sandstone, in bold relief: a darker and harder stone (I
think, not serpentine, but its surface is so disguised by the lustre of
ages that I could not be certain) is used for the capitals of the
western door, which are especially elaborate in their sculpture;--two
devilish apes, or apish devils, I know not which, with bristly
moustaches and edgy teeth, half-crouching, with their hands
impertinently on their knees, ready for a spit or a spring if one goes
near them; but all is pure bossy sculpture; there is no inlaying, except
of some variegated tiles in the shape of saucers set concave (an
ornament used also very gracefully in St.Jacopo of Bologna): and the
whole surface of the church is enriched with the massy reliefs, well
preserved everywhere above the reach of human animals, but utterly
destroyed to some five or six feet from the ground; worn away into large
cellular hollows and caverns, some almost deep enough to render the
walls unsafe, entirely owing to the uses to which the recesses of the
church are dedicated by the refined and high-minded Italians.Michele of Lucca is wrought entirely in white marble and green
serpentine; there is hardly any relieved sculpture except in the
capitals of the shafts and cornices, and all the designs of wall
ornament are inlaid with exquisite precision--white on dark ground; the
ground being cut out and filled with serpentine, the figures left in
solid marble.The designs of the Pavian church are encrusted on the
walls; of the Lucchese, incorporated with them; small portions of real
sculpture being introduced exactly where the eye, after its rest on the
flatness of the wall, will take most delight in the piece of substantial
form.The entire arrangement is perfect beyond all praise, and the
morbid restlessness of the old designs is now appeased.Geometry seems
to have acted as a febrifuge, for beautiful geometrical designs are
introduced amidst the tumult of the hunt; and there is no more seeing
double, nor ghastly monstrosity of conception; no more ending of
everything in something else; no more disputing for spare legs among
bewildered bodies; no more setting on of heads wrong side foremost.The
fragments have come together: we are out of the Inferno with its weeping
down the spine; we are in the fair hunting-fields of the Lucchese
mountains (though they had their tears also),--with horse, and hound,
and hawk; and merry blast of the trumpet.--Very strange creatures to be
hunted, in all truth; but still creatures with a single head, and that
on their shoulders, which is exactly the last place in the Pavian church
where a head is to be looked for.Cockerell wonders, in one of his lectures, why I give
so much praise to this "crazy front of Lucca."But it is not crazy; not
by any means.Altogether sober, in comparison with the early Lombard
work, or with our Norman.Crazy in one sense it is: utterly neglected,
to the breaking of its old stout heart; the venomous nights and salt
frosts of the Maremma winters have their way with it--"Poor Tom's a
cold!"The weeds that feed on the marsh air, have twisted themselves
into its crannies; the polished fragments of serpentine are spit and
rent out of their cells, and lie in green ruins along its ledges; the
salt sea winds have eaten away the fair shafting of its star window into
a skeleton of crumbling rays.It cannot stand much longer; may Heaven
only, in its benignity, preserve it from restoration, and the sands of
the Serchio give it honorable grave.In the "Seven Lamps," Plate VI., I gave a faithful drawing of one of its
upper arches, to which I must refer the reader; for there is a marked
piece of character in the figure of the horseman on the left of it.And
in making this reference, I would say a few words about those much
abused plates of the "Seven Lamps."They are black, they are overbitten,
they are hastily drawn, they are coarse and disagreeable; how
disagreeable to many readers I venture not to conceive.But their truth
is carried to an extent never before attempted in architectural drawing.It does not in the least follow that because a drawing is delicate, or
looks careful, it has been carefully drawn from the thing represented;
in nine instances out of ten, careful and delicate drawings are made at
home.It is not so easy as the reader, perhaps, imagines, to finish a
drawing altogether on the spot, especially of details seventy feet from
the ground; and any one who will try the position in which I have had to
do some of my work--standing, namely, on a cornice or window sill,
holding by one arm round a shaft, and hanging over the street (or canal,
at Venice), with my sketch-book supported against the wall from which I
was drawing, by my breast, so as to leave my right hand free--will not
thenceforward wonder that shadows should be occasionally carelessly
laid in, or lines drawn with some unsteadiness.But, steady, or infirm,
the sketches of which those plates in the "Seven Lamps" are fac-similes,
were made from the architecture itself, and represent that architecture
with its actual shadows at the time of day at which it was drawn, and
with every fissure and line of it as they now exist; so that when I am
speaking of some new point, which perhaps the drawing was not intended
to illustrate, I can yet turn back to it with perfect certainty that if
anything be found in it bearing on matters now in hand, I may depend
upon it just as securely as if I had gone back to look again at the
building.It is necessary that my readers should understand this thoroughly, and I
did not before sufficiently explain it; but I believe I can show them
the use of this kind of truth, now that we are again concerned with this
front of Lucca.They will find a drawing of the entire front in Gally
Knight's "Architecture of Italy."It may serve to give them an idea of
its general disposition, and it looks very careful and accurate; but
every bit of the ornament on it is _drawn out of the artist's head_.There is not _one line_ of it that exists on the building.The reader
will therefore, perhaps, think my ugly black plate of somewhat more
value, upon the whole, in its rough veracity, than the other in its
delicate fiction.[97]

[Illustration: Plate XXI.As, however, I made a drawing of another part of the church somewhat
more delicately, and as I do not choose that my favorite church should
suffer in honor by my coarse work, I have had this, as far as might be,
fac-similied by line engraving (Plate XXI.).It represents the southern
side of the lower arcade of the west front; and may convey some idea of
the exquisite finish and grace of the whole; but the old plate, in the
"Seven Lamps," gives a nearer view of one of the upper arches, and a
more faithful impression of the present aspect of the work, and
especially of the seats of the horsemen; the limb straight, and well
down on the stirrup (the warrior's seat, observe, not the jockey's),
with a single pointed spur on the heel.The bit of the lower cornice
under this arch I could not see, and therefore had not drawn; it was
supplied from beneath another arch.I am afraid, however, the reader has
lost the thread of my story while I have been recommending my veracity
to him.I was insisting upon the healthy tone of this Lucca work as
compared with the old spectral Lombard friezes.The apes of the Pavian
church ride without stirrups, but all is in good order and harness here:
civilisation had done its work; there was reaping of corn in the Val
d'Arno, though rough hunting still upon its hills.But in the north,
though a century or two later, we find the forests of the Rhone, and its
rude limestone cotes, haunted by phantasms still (more meat-eating,
then, I think).I do not know a more interesting group of cathedrals
than that of Lyons, Vienne, and Valencia: a more interesting indeed,
generally, than beautiful; but there is a row of niches on the west
front of Lyons, and a course of panelled decoration about its doors,
which is, without exception, the most exquisite piece of Northern Gothic
I ever beheld, and with which I know nothing that is even comparable,
except the work of the north transept of Rouen, described in the "Seven
Lamps," p.159; work of about the same date, and exactly the same plan;
quatrefoils filled with grotesques, but somewhat less finished in
execution, and somewhat less wild in imagination.I wrote down hastily,
and in their own course, the subjects of some of the quatrefoils of
Lyons; of which I here give the reader the sequence:--

   1.Elephant and castle; less graphic than the St.A huge head walking on two legs, turned backwards, hoofed; the
        head has a horn behind, with drapery over it, which ends in
        another head.A boar hunt; the boar under a tree, very spirited.A bird putting its head between its legs to bite its own tail,
        which ends in a head.A dragon with a human head set on the wrong way.Peter awakened by the angel in prison; full of spirit, the
        prison picturesque, with a trefoiled arch, the angel eager, St.The miraculous draught of fishes; fish and all, in the small
        space.A large leaf, with two snails rampant, coming out of nautilus
        shells, with grotesque faces, and eyes at the ends of their
        horns.A man with an axe striking at a dog's head, which comes out of
        a nautilus shell: the rim of the shell branches into a stem
        with two large leaves.Sebastian; his body very full of arrows.Beasts coming to ark; Noah opening a kind of wicker cage.A vine leaf with a dragon's head and tail, the one biting the
        other.A man riding a goat, catching a flying devil.An eel or muraena growing into a bunch of flowers, which turns
        into two wings.A sprig of hazel, with nuts, thrown all around the quatrefoils
        with a squirrel in centre, apparently attached to the tree only
        by its enormous tail, richly furrowed into hair, and nobly
        sweeping.Four hares fastened together by the ears, galloping in a circle.Mingled with these grotesques are many _sword_ and _buckler_
        combats, the bucklers being round and conical like a hat; I
        thought the first I noticed, carried by a man at full gallop on
        horseback, had been a small umbrella.This list of subjects may sufficiently illustrate the feverish character
of the Northern Energy; but influencing the treatment of the whole there
is also the Northern love of what is called the Grotesque, a feeling
which I find myself, for the present, quite incapable either of
analysing or defining, though we all have a distinct idea attached to
the word: I shall try, however, in the next volume.WOODEN CHURCHES OF THE NORTH.I cannot pledge myself to this theory of the origin of the vaulting
shaft, but the reader will find some interesting confirmations of it in
Dahl's work on the wooden churches of Norway.The inside view of the
church of Borgund shows the timber construction of one shaft run up
through a crossing architrave, and continued into the clerestory; while
the church of Urnes is in the exact form of a basilica; but the wall
above the arches is formed of planks, with a strong upright above each
capital.The passage quoted from Stephen Eddy's Life of Bishop Wilfrid,
at p.86 of Churton's "Early English Church," gives us one of the
transformations or petrifactions of the wooden Saxon churches."At Ripon
he built a new church of _polished stone_, with columns variously
ornamented, and porches."Churton adds: "It was perhaps in bad
imitation of the marble buildings he had seen in Italy, that he washed
the walls of this original York Minster, and made them 'whiter than
snow.'"CHURCH OF ALEXANDRIA.The very cause which enabled the Venetians to possess themselves of the
body of St.Mark, was the destruction of the church by the caliph for
the _sake of its marbles_: the Arabs and Venetians, though bitter
enemies, thus building on the same models; these in reverence for the
destroyed church, and those with the very pieces of it.In the somewhat
prolix account of the matter given in the Notizie Storiche (above
quoted) the main points are, that "il Califa de' Saraceni, per
fabbricarsi un Palazzo presse di Babilonia, aveva ordinato che dalle
Chiese d' Cristiani si togliessero i piu scelti marmi;" and that the
Venetians, "videro sotto i loro occhi flagellarsi crudelmente un
Cristiano per aver infranto un marmo."I heartily wish that the same
kind of punishment were enforced to this day, for the same sin.I am glad here to re-assert opinions which it has grieved me to be
suspected of having changed.The calmer tone of the second volume of
"Modern Painters," as compared with the first, induced, I believe, this
suspicion, very justifiably, in the minds of many of its readers.The
difference resulted, however, from the simple fact, that the first was
written in great haste and indignation, for a special purpose and
time;--the second, after I had got engaged, almost unawares, in
inquiries which could not be hastily nor indignantly pursued; my
opinions remaining then, and remaining now, altogether unchanged on the
subject which led me into the discussion.And that no farther doubt of
them may be entertained by any who may think them worth questioning, I
shall here, once for all, express them in the plainest and fewest words
I can.I think that J. M. W. Turner is not only the greatest (professed)
landscape painter who ever lived, but that he has in him as much as
would have furnished all the rest with such power as they had; and that
if we put Nicolo Poussin, Salvator, and our own Gainsborough out of the
group, he would cut up into Claudes, Cuyps, Ruysdaels, and such others,
by uncounted bunches.I hope this is plainly and strongly enough stated.And farther, I like his later pictures, up to the year 1845, the best;
and believe that those persons who only like his early pictures do not,
in fact, like him at all.They do _not_ like that which is essentially
_his_.They like that in which he resembles other men; which he had
learned from Loutherbourg, Claude, or Wilson; that which is indeed his
own, they do not care for.Not that there is not much of his own in his
early works; they are all invaluable in their way; but those persons who
can find no beauty in his strangest fantasy on the Academy walls, cannot
distinguish the peculiarly Turneresque characters of the earlier
pictures.And, therefore, I again state here, that I think his pictures
painted between the years 1830 and 1845 his greatest; and that his
entire power is best represented by such pictures as the Temeraire, the
Sun of Venice going to Sea, and others, painted exactly at the time when
the public and the press were together loudest in abuse of him.I desire, however, the reader to observe that I said, above, _professed_
landscape painters, among whom, perhaps, I should hardly have put
Gainsborough.The landscape of the great figure painters is often
majestic in the highest degree, and Tintoret's especially shows exactly
the same power and feeling as Turner's.If with Turner I were to rank
the historical painters as landscapists, estimating rather the power
they show, than the actual value of the landscape they produced, I
should class those, whose landscapes I have studied, in some such order
as this at the side of the page:--associating with the landscape of
Perugino that of Francia and Angelico, and the other severe painters of
religious subjects.I have put Turner and Tintoret side by side, not
knowing which is, in landscape, the greater; I had nearly associated in
the same manner the noble names of John Bellini and Albert Durer; but
Bellini must be put first, for his profound religious peace yet not
separated from the other, if but that we might remember his kindness to
him in Venice; and it is well we should take note of it here, for it
furnishes us with a most interesting confirmation of what was said in
the text respecting the position of Bellini as the last of the religious
painters of Venice.The following passage is quoted in Jackson's "Essay
on Wood-engraving," from Albert Durer's Diary:

"I have many good friends among the Italians who warn me not to eat or
drink with their painters, of whom several are my enemies, and copy my
picture in the church, and others of mine, wherever they can find them,
and yet they blame them, _and say they are not according to ancient art,
and therefore not good_.Giovanni Bellini, however, has praised me
highly to several gentlemen, and wishes to have something of my doing:
he called on me himself, and requested that I would paint a picture for
him, for which, he said, he would pay me well.People are all surprised
that I should be so much thought of by a person of his reputation: he is
very old, but is still the best painter of them all."A choice little piece of description this, of the Renaissance painters,
side by side with the good old Venetian, who was soon to leave them to
their own ways.The Renaissance men are seen in perfection, envying,
stealing, and lying, but without wit enough to lie to purpose.It is of the highest importance, in these days, that Romanism should be
deprived of the miserable influence which its pomp and picturesqueness
have given it over the weak sentimentalism of the English people; I call
it a miserable influence, for of all motives to sympathy with the Church
of Rome, this I unhesitatingly class as the basest: I can, in some
measure, respect the other feelings which have been the beginnings of
apostasy; I can respect the desire for unity which would reclaim the
Romanist by love, and the distrust of his own heart which subjects the
proselyte to priestly power; I say I can respect these feelings, though
I cannot pardon unprincipled submission to them, nor enough wonder at
the infinite fatuity of the unhappy persons whom they have
betrayed:--Fatuity, self-inflicted, and stubborn in resistance to God's
Word and man's reason!--to talk of the authority of the Church, as if
the Church were anything else than the whole company of Christian men,
or were ever spoken of in Scripture[98] as other than a company to be
taught and fed, not to teach and feed.--Fatuity!to talk of a separation
of Church and State, as if a Christian state, and every officer therein,
were not necessarily a part of the Church,[99] and as if any state
officer could do his duty without endeavoring to aid and promote
religion, or any clerical officer do his duty without seeking for such
aid and accepting it:--Fatuity!to seek for the unity of a living body
of truth and trust in God, with a dead body of lies and trust in wood,
and thence to expect anything else than plague, and consumption by worms
undying, for both.to ask for any better
interpreter of God's Word than God, or to expect knowledge of it in any
other way than the plainly ordered way: if _any_ man will do he shall
know.But of all these fatuities, the basest is the being lured into the
Romanist Church by the glitter of it, like larks into a trap by broken
glass; to be blown into a change of religion by the whine of an
organ-pipe; stitched into a new creed by gold threads on priests'
petticoats; jangled into a change of conscience by the chimes of a
belfry.I know nothing in the shape of error so dark as this, no
imbecility so absolute, no treachery so contemptible.I had hardly
believed that it was a thing possible, though vague stories had been
told me of the effect, on some minds, of mere scarlet and candles, until
I came on this passage in Pugin's "Remarks on articles in the
Rambler":--

"Those who have lived in want and privation are the best qualified to
appreciate the blessings of plenty; thus, those who have been devout and
sincere members of the separated portion of the English Church; who have
prayed, and hoped, and loved, through all the poverty of the maimed
rites which it has retained--to them does the realisation of all their
longing desires appear truly ravishing.when one of the solemn piles is presented to them,
in all its pristine life and glory!--the stoups are filled to the brim;
the rood is raised on high; the screen glows with sacred imagery and
rich device; the niches are filled; the altar is replaced, sustained by
sculptured shafts, the relics of the saints repose beneath, the body of
Our Lord is enshrined on its consecrated stone; the lamps of the
sanctuary burn bright; the saintly portraitures in the glass windows
shine all gloriously; and the albs hang in the oaken ambries, and the
cope chests are filled with orphreyed baudekins; and pix and pax, and
chrismatory are there, and thurible, and cross."One might have put this man under a pix, and left him, one should have
thought; but he has been brought forward, and partly received, as an
example of the effect of ceremonial splendor on the mind of a great
architect.It is very necessary, therefore, that all those who have felt
sorrow at this should know at once that he is not a great architect,
but one of the smallest possible or conceivable architects; and that by
his own account and setting forth of himself.Hear him:--

"I believe, as regards architecture, few men have been so unfortunate as
myself.I have passed my life in thinking of fine things, studying fine
things, designing fine things, and realising very poor ones.I have
never had the chance of producing a single fine ecclesiastical building,
except my own church, where I am both paymaster and architect; but
everything else, either for want of adequate funds or injudicious
interference and control, or some other contingency, is more or less a
failure.George's was spoilt by the very instructions laid down by the
committee, that it was to hold 3000 people on the floor at a limited
price; in consequence, height, proportion, everything, was sacrificed to
meet these conditions.Nottingham was spoilt by the style being
restricted to lancet,--a period well suited to a Cistercian abbey in a
secluded vale, but very unsuitable for the centre of a crowded
town.* * *

"Kirkham was spoilt through several hundred pounds being reduced on the
original estimate; to effect this, which was a great sum in proportion
to the entire cost, the area of the church was contracted, the walls
lowered, tower and spire reduced, the thickness of walls diminished, and
stone arches omitted."(Remarks, &c., by A. Welby Pugin: Dolman, 1850.)Phidias can niche himself into the corner of a pediment, and
Raffaelle expatiate within the circumference of a clay platter; but
Pugin is inexpressible in less than a cathedral?Let his ineffableness
be assured of this, once for all, that no difficulty or restraint ever
happened to a man of real power, but his power was the more manifested
in the contending with, or conquering it; and that there is no field so
small, no cranny so contracted, but that a great spirit can house and
manifest itself therein.The thunder that smites the Alp into dust, can
gather itself into the width of a golden wire.Whatever greatness there
was in you, had it been Buonarroti's own, you had room enough for it in
a single niche: you might have put the whole power of it into two feet
cube of Caen stone.George's was not high enough for want of money?But was it want of money that made you put that blunt, overloaded,
laborious ogee door into the side of it?Was it for lack of funds that
you sunk the tracery of the parapet in its clumsy zigzags?Was it in
parsimony that you buried its paltry pinnacles in that eruption of
diseased crockets?or in pecuniary embarrassment that you set up the
belfry foolscaps, with the mimicry of dormer windows, which nobody can
ever reach nor look out of?Not so, but in mere incapability of better
things.I am sorry to have to speak thus of any living architect; and there is
much in this man, if he were rightly estimated, which one might both
regard and profit by.He has a most sincere love for his profession, a
heartily honest enthusiasm for pixes and piscinas; and though he will
never design so much as a pix or a piscina thoroughly well, yet better
than most of the experimental architects of the day.Employ him by all
means, but on small work.Expect no cathedrals from him; but no one, at
present, can design a better finial.That is an exceedingly beautiful
one over the western door of St.George's; and there is some spirited
impishness and switching of tails in the supporting figures at the
imposts.Only do not allow his good designing of finials to be employed
as an evidence in matters of divinity, nor thence deduce the
incompatibility of Protestantism and art.I should have said all that I
have said above, of artistical apostasy, if Giotto had been now living
in Florence, and if art were still doing all that it did once for Rome.But the grossness of the error becomes incomprehensible as well as
unpardonable, when we look to what level of degradation the human
intellect has sunk at this instant in Italy.So far from Romanism now
producing anything greater in art, it cannot even preserve what has been
given to its keeping.I know no abuses of precious inheritance half so
grievous, as the abuse of all that is best in art wherever the Romanist
priesthood gets possession of it.The noblest pieces of mediaeval sculpture in North Italy, the two
griffins at the central (west) door of the cathedral of Verona, were
daily permitted to be brought into service, when I was there in the
autumn of 1849, by a washerwoman living in the Piazza, who tied her
clothes-lines to their beaks: and the shafts of St.Mark's at Venice
were used by a salesman of common caricatures to fasten his prints upon
(Compare Appendix 25); and this in the face of the continually passing
priests: while the quantity of noble art annually destroyed in
altarpieces by candle-droppings, or perishing by pure brutality of
neglect, passes all estimate.I do not know, as I have repeatedly
stated, how far the splendor of architecture, or other art, is
compatible with the honesty and usefulness of religious service.The
longer I live, the more I incline to severe judgment in this matter, and
the less I can trust the sentiments excited by painted glass and 
tiles.But if there be indeed value in such things, our plain duty is to
direct our strength against the superstition which has dishonored them;
there are thousands who might possibly be benefited by them, to whom
they are now merely an offence, owing to their association with
idolatrous ceremonies.I have but this exhortation for all who love
them,--not to regulate their creeds by their taste in colors, but to
hold calmly to the right, at whatever present cost to their imaginative
enjoyment; sure that they will one day find in heavenly truth a brighter
charm than in earthly imagery, and striving to gather stones for the
eternal building, whose walls shall be salvation, and whose gates shall
be praise.The reader may at first suppose this division of the attributes of
buildings into action, voice, and beauty, to be the same division as Mr.Fergusson's, now well known, of their merits, into technic, aesthetic and
phonetic.But there is no connection between the two systems; mine, indeed, does
not profess to be a system, it is a mere arrangement of my subject, for
the sake of order and convenience in its treatment: but, as far as it
goes, it differs altogether from Mr.Fergusson's in these two following
respects:--

The action of a building, that is to say its standing or consistence,
depends on its good construction; and the first part of the foregoing
volume has been entirely occupied with the consideration of the
constructive merit of buildings: but construction is not their only
technical merit.There is as much of technical merit in their
expression, or in their beauty, as in their construction.There is no
more mechanical or technical admirableness in the stroke of the painter
who covers them with fresco, than in the dexterity of the mason who
cements their stones: there is just as much of what is technical in
their beauty, therefore, as in their construction; and, on the other
hand, there is often just as much intellect shown in their construction
as there is in either their expression or decoration.Fergusson
means by his "Phonetic" division, whatever expresses intellect: my
constructive division, therefore, includes part of his phonetic: and my
expressive and decorative divisions include part of his technical.Fergusson tries to make the same divisions fit the
_subjects_ of art, and art itself; and therefore talks of technic,
aesthetic, and phonetic, _arts_, (or, translating the Greek,) of artful
arts, sensitive arts, and talkative arts; but I have nothing to do with
any division of the arts, I have to deal only with the merits of
_buildings_.As, however, I have been led into reference to Mr.Fergusson's system, I would fain say a word or two to effect Mr.Fergusson's extrication from it.I hope to find in him a noble ally,
ready to join with me in war upon affectation, falsehood, and prejudice,
of every kind: I have derived much instruction from his most interesting
work, and I hope for much more from its continuation; but he must
disentangle himself from his system, or he will be strangled by it;
never was anything so ingeniously and hopelessly wrong throughout; the
whole of it is founded on a confusion of the instruments of man with his
capacities.Fergusson would have us take--

  "First, man's muscular action or power.""Secondly, those developments of sense _by_ which _he does!!_ as much
    as by his muscles.""Lastly, his intellect, or to confine this more correctly to its
    external action, _his power of speech!!Granting this division of humanity correct, or sufficient, the writer
then most curiously supposes that he may arrange the arts as if there
were some belonging to each division of man,--never observing that every
art must be governed by, and addressed to, one division, and executed by
another; executed by the muscular, addressed to the sensitive or
intellectual; and that, to be an art at all, it must have in it work of
the one, and guidance from the other.If, by any lucky accident, he had
been led to arrange the arts, either by their objects, and the things to
which they are addressed, or by their means, and the things by which
they are executed, he would have discovered his mistake in an instant.As thus:--

  These arts are addressed to the,--Muscles!!Senses,
                                    Intellect;
                   or executed by,--Muscles,
                                    Senses!!Indeed it is true that some of the arts are in a sort addressed to the
muscles, surgery for instance; but this is not among Mr.Fergusson's
technic, but his politic, arts!and all the arts may, in a sort, be said
to be performed by the senses, as the senses guide both muscles and
intellect in their work: but they guide them as they receive
information, or are standards of accuracy, but not as in themselves
capable of action.Fergusson is, I believe, the first person who has
told us of senses that act or do, they having been hitherto supposed
only to sustain or perceive.The weight of error, however, rests just as
much in the original division of man, as in the endeavor to fit the arts
to it.The slight omission of the soul makes a considerable difference
when it begins to influence the final results of the arrangement.Fergusson calls morals and religion "Politick arts" (as if religion
were an art at all!or as if both were not as necessary to individuals
as to societies); and therefore, forming these into a body of arts by
themselves, leaves the best of the arts to do without the soul and the
moral feeling as rest they may.Hence "expression," or "phonetics," is
of intellect only (as if men never expressed their _feelings!_); and
then, strangest and worst of all, intellect is entirely resolved into
talking!There can be no intellect but it must talk, and all talking
must be intellectual.I believe people do sometimes talk without
understanding; and I think the world would fare ill if they never
understood without talking.The intellect is an entirely silent faculty,
and has nothing to do with parts of speech any more than the moral part
has.A man may feel and know things without expressing either the
feeling or knowledge; and the talking is a _muscular_ mode of
communicating the workings of the intellect or heart--muscular, whether
it be by tongue or by sign, or by carving or writing, or by expression
of feature; so that to divide a man into muscular and talking parts, is
to divide him into body in general, and tongue in particular, the
endless confusion resulting from which arrangement is only less
marvellous in itself, than the resolution with which Mr.Fergusson has
worked through it, and in spite of it, up to some very interesting and
suggestive truths; although starting with a division of humanity which
does not in the least raise it above the brute, for a rattlesnake has
his muscular, aesthetic, and talking part as much as man, only he talks
with his tail, and says, "I am angry with you, and should like to bite
you," more laconically and effectively than any phonetic biped could,
were he so minded.And, in fact, the real difference between the brute
and man is not so much that the one has fewer means of expression than
the other, as that it has fewer thoughts to express, and that we do not
understand its expressions.Animals can talk to one another intelligibly
enough when they have anything to say, and their captains have words of
command just as clear as ours, and better obeyed.We have indeed, in
watching the efforts of an intelligent animal to talk to a human being,
a melancholy sense of its dumbness; but the fault is still in its
intelligence, more than in its tongue.It has not wit enough to
systematise its cries or signs, and form them into language.But there is no end to the fallacies and confusions of Mr.Fergusson's
arrangement.It is a perfect entanglement of gun-cotton, and explodes
into vacuity wherever one holds a light to it.I shall leave him to do
so with the rest of it for himself, and should perhaps have left it to
his own handling altogether, but for the intemperateness of the spirit
with which he has spoken on a subject perhaps of all others demanding
gentleness and caution.No man could more earnestly have desired the
changes lately introduced into the system of the University of Oxford
than I did myself: no man can be more deeply sensible than I of grievous
failures in the practical working even of the present system: but I
believe that these failures may be almost without exception traced to
one source, the want of evangelical, and the excess of rubrical religion
among the tutors; together with such rustinesses and stiffnesses as
necessarily attend the continual operation of any intellectual machine.The fault is, at any rate, far less in the system than in the
imperfection of its administration; and had it been otherwise, the terms
in which Mr.Fergusson speaks of it are hardly decorous in one who can
but be imperfectly acquainted with its working.They are sufficiently
answered by the structure of the essay in which they occur; for if the
high powers of mind which its author possesses had been subjected to the
discipline of the schools, he could not have wasted his time on the
development of a system which their simplest formulae of logic would have
shown him to be untenable.Fergusson will, however, find it easier to overthrow his system than
to replace it.Every man of science knows the difficulty of arranging a
_reasonable_ system of classification, in any subject, by any one group
of characters; and that the best classifications are, in many of their
branches, convenient rather than reasonable: so that, to any person who
is really master of his subject, many different modes of classification
will occur at different times; one of which he will use rather than
another, according to the point which he has to investigate.I need only
instance the three arrangements of minerals, by their external
characters, and their positive or negative bases, of which the first is
the most useful, the second the most natural, the third the most simple;
and all in several ways unsatisfactory.But when the subject becomes one which no single mind can grasp, and
which embraces the whole range of human occupation and enquiry, the
difficulties become as great, and the methods as various, as the uses to
which the classification might be put; and Mr.Fergusson has entirely
forgotten to inform us what is the object to which his arrangements are
addressed.For observe: there is one kind of arrangement which is based
on the rational connection of the sciences or arts with one another; an
arrangement which maps them out like the rivers of some great country,
and marks the points of their junction, and the direction and force of
their united currents; and this without assigning to any one of them a
superiority above another, but considering them all as necessary members
of the noble unity of human science and effort.There is another kind of
classification which contemplates the order of succession in which they
might most usefully be presented to a single mind, so that the given
mind should obtain the most effective and available knowledge of them
all: and, finally, the most usual classification contemplates the powers
of mind which they each require for their pursuit, the objects to which
they are addressed, or with which they are concerned; and assigns to
each of them a rank superior or inferior, according to the nobility of
the powers they require, or the grandeur of the subjects they
contemplate.Now, not only would it be necessary to adopt a different classification
with respect to each of these great intentions, but it might be found so
even to vary the order of the succession of sciences in the case of
every several mind to which they were addressed; and that their rank
would also vary with the power and specific character of the mind
engaged upon them.I once heard a very profound mathematician
remonstrate against the impropriety of Wordsworth's receiving a pension
from government, on the ground that he was "only a poet."If the study
of mathematics had always this narrowing effect upon the sympathies, the
science itself would need to be deprived of the rank usually assigned to
it; and there could be no doubt that, in the effect it had on the mind
of this man, and of such others, it was a very contemptible science
indeed.Hence, in estimating the real rank of any art or science, it is
necessary for us to conceive it as it would be grasped by minds of every
order.There are some arts and sciences which we underrate, because no
one has risen to show us with what majesty they may be invested; and
others which we overrate, because we are blinded to their general
meanness by the magnificence which some one man has thrown around them:
thus, philology, evidently the most contemptible of all the sciences,
has been raised to unjust dignity by Johnson.[100] And the subject is
farther complicated by the question of usefulness; for many of the arts
and sciences require considerable intellectual power for their pursuit,
and yet become contemptible by the slightness of what they accomplish:
metaphysics, for instance, exercising intelligence of a high order, yet
useless to the mass of mankind, and, to its own masters, dangerous.Yet,
as it has become so by the want of the true intelligence which its
inquiries need, and by substitution of vain subtleties in its stead, it
may in future vindicate for itself a higher rank than a man of common
sense usually concedes to it.Nevertheless, the mere attempt at arrangement must be useful, even where
it does nothing more than develop difficulties.Perhaps the greatest
fault of men of learning is their so often supposing all other branches
of science dependent upon or inferior to their own best beloved branch;
and the greatest deficiency of men comparatively unlearned, their want
of perception of the connection of the branches with each other.He who
holds the tree only by the extremities, can perceive nothing but the
separation of its sprays.It must always be desirable to prove to those
the equality of rank, to these the closeness of sequence, of what they
had falsely supposed subordinate or separate.And, after such candid
admission of the co-equal dignity of the truly noble arts and sciences,
we may be enabled more justly to estimate the inferiority of those which
indeed seem intended for the occupation of inferior powers and narrower
capacities.In Appendix 14, following, some suggestions will be found as
to the principles on which classification might be based; but the
arrangement of all the arts is certainly not a work which could with
discretion be attempted in the Appendix to an essay on a branch of one
of them.The reader will probably understand this part of the subject better if
he will take the trouble briefly to consider the actions of the mind and
body of man in the sciences and arts, which give these latter the
relations of rank usually attributed to them.It was above observed (Appendix 13) that the arts were generally ranked
according to the nobility of the powers they require, that is to say,
the quantity of the being of man which they engaged or addressed.Now
their rank is not a very important matter as regards each other, for
there are few disputes more futile than that concerning the respective
dignity of arts, all of which are necessary and honorable.But it is a
very important matter as regards themselves; very important whether
they are practised with the devotion and regarded with the respect
which are necessary or due to their perfection.It does not at all
matter whether architecture or sculpture be the nobler art; but it
matters much whether the thought is bestowed upon buildings, or the
feeling is expressed in statues, which make either deserving of our
admiration.It is foolish and insolent to imagine that the art which we
ourselves practise is greater than any other; but it is wise to take
care that in our own hands it is as noble as we can make it.Let us take
some notice, therefore, in what degrees the faculties of man may be
engaged in his several arts: we may consider the entire man as made up
of body, soul, and intellect (Lord Lindsay, meaning the same thing, says
inaccurately--sense, intellect, and spirit--forgetting that there is a
moral sense as well as a bodily sense, and a spiritual body as well as a
natural body, and so gets into some awkward confusion, though right in
the main points).Then, taking the word soul as a short expression of
the moral and responsible part of being, each of these three parts has a
passive and active power.The body has senses and muscles; the soul,
feeling and resolution; the intellect, understanding and imagination.The scheme may be put into tabular form, thus:--

              Passive or Receptive Part.Body                  Senses.Soul                  Feeling.Intellect             Understanding.In this scheme I consider memory a part of understanding, and conscience
I leave out, as being the voice of God in the heart, inseparable from
the system, yet not an essential part of it.The sense of beauty I
consider a mixture of the Senses of the body and soul.Now all these parts of the human system have a reciprocal action on one
another, so that the true perfection of any of them is not possible
without some relative perfection of the others, and yet any one of the
parts of the system may be brought into a morbid development,
inconsistent with the perfection of the others.Thus, in a healthy
state, the acuteness of the senses quickens that of the feelings, and
these latter quicken the understanding, and then all the three quicken
the imagination, and then all the four strengthen the resolution; while
yet there is a danger, on the other hand, that the encouraged and morbid
feeling may weaken or bias the understanding, or that the over shrewd
and keen understanding may shorten the imagination, or that the
understanding and imagination together may take place of, or undermine,
the resolution, as in Hamlet.So in the mere bodily frame there is a
delightful perfection of the senses, consistent with the utmost health
of the muscular system, as in the quick sight and hearing of an active
savage: another false delicacy of the senses, in the Sybarite,
consequent on their over indulgence, until the doubled rose-leaf is
painful; and this inconsistent with muscular perfection.Again; there is
a perfection of muscular action consistent with exquisite sense, as in
that of the fingers of a musician or of a painter, in which the muscles
are guided by the slightest feeling of the strings, or of the pencil:
another perfection of muscular action inconsistent with acuteness of
sense, as in the effort of battle, in which a soldier does not perceive
his wounds.So that it is never so much the question, what is the
solitary perfection of a given part of the man, as what is its balanced
perfection in relation to the whole of him: and again, the perfection of
any single power is not merely to be valued by the mere rank of the
power itself, but by the harmony which it indicates among the other
powers.Thus, for instance, in an archer's glance along his arrow, or a
hunter's raising of his rifle, there is a certain perfection of sense
and finger which is the result of mere practice, of a simple bodily
perfection; but there is a farther value in the habit which results from
the resolution and intellect necessary to the forming of it: in the
hunter's raising of his rifle there is a quietness implying far more
than mere practice,--implying courage, and habitual meeting of danger,
and presence of mind, and many other such noble characters.So also in a
musician's way of laying finger on his instrument, or a painter's
handling of his pencil, there are many qualities expressive of the
special sensibilities of each, operating on the production of the habit,
besides the sensibility operating at the moment of action.So that there
are three distinct stages of merit in what is commonly called mere
bodily dexterity: the first, the dexterity given by practice, called
command of tools or of weapons; the second stage, the dexterity or
grace given by character, as the gentleness of hand proceeding from
modesty or tenderness of spirit, and the steadiness of it resulting from
habitual patience coupled with decision, and the thousand other
characters partially discernible, even in a man's writing, much more in
his general handiwork; and, thirdly, there is the perfection of action
produced by the operation of _present_ strength, feeling, or
intelligence on instruments thus _previously_ perfected, as the handling
of a great painter is rendered more beautiful by his immediate care and
feeling and love of his subject, or knowledge of it, and as physical
strength is increased by strength of will and greatness of heart.Imagine, for instance, the difference in manner of fighting, and in
actual muscular strength and endurance, between a common soldier, and a
man in the circumstances of the Horatii, or of the temper of Leonidas.Mere physical skill, therefore, the mere perfection and power of the
body as an instrument, is manifested in three stages:

  First, Bodily power by practice;
  Secondly, Bodily power by moral habit;
  Thirdly, Bodily power by immediate energy;

and the arts will be greater or less, caeteris paribus, according to the
degrees of these dexterities which they admit.A smith's work at his
anvil admits little but the first; fencing, shooting, and riding, admit
something of the second; while the fine arts admit (merely through the
channel of the bodily dexterities) an expression almost of the whole
man.Nevertheless, though the higher arts _admit_ this higher bodily
perfection, they do not all _require_ it in equal degrees, but can
dispense with it more and more in proportion to their dignity.The arts
whose chief element is bodily dexterity, may be classed together as arts
of the third order, of which the highest will be those which admit most
of the power of moral habit and energy, such as riding and the
management of weapons; and the rest may be thrown together under the
general title of handicrafts, of which it does not much matter which are
the most honorable, but rather, which are the most necessary and least
injurious to health, which it is not our present business to examine.Men engaged in the practice of these are called artizans, as opposed to
artists, who are concerned with the fine arts.The next step in elevation of art is the addition of the intelligences
which have no connection with bodily dexterity; as, for instance, in
hunting, the knowledge of the habits of animals and their places of
abode; in architecture, of mathematics; in painting, of harmonies of
color; in music, of those of sound; all this pure science being joined
with readiness of expedient in applying it, and with shrewdness in
apprehension of difficulties, either present or probable.It will often happen that intelligence of this kind is possessed without
bodily dexterity, or the need of it; one man directing and another
executing, as for the most part in architecture, war, and seamanship.And it is to be observed, also, that in proportion to the dignity of the
art, the bodily dexterities needed even in its subordinate agents become
less important, and are more and more replaced by intelligence; as in
the steering of a ship, the bodily dexterity required is less than in
shooting or fencing, but the intelligence far greater: and so in war,
the mere swordsmanship and marksmanship of the troops are of small
importance in comparison with their disposition, and right choice of the
moment of action.So that arts of this second order must be estimated,
not by the quantity of bodily dexterity they require, but by the
quantity and dignity of the knowledge needed in their practice, and by
the degree of subtlety needed in bringing such knowledge into play.War
certainly stands first in the general mind, not only as the greatest of
the arts which I have called of the second order, but as the greatest of
all arts.It is not, however, easy to distinguish the respect paid to
the Power, from that rendered to the Art of the soldier; the honor of
victory being more dependent, in the vulgar mind, on its results, than
its difficulties.I believe, however, that taking into consideration the
greatness of the anxieties under which this art must be practised, the
multitude of circumstances to be known and regarded in it, and the
subtleties both of apprehension and stratagem constantly demanded by it,
as well as the multiplicity of disturbing accidents and doubtful
contingencies against which it must make provision on the instant, it
must indeed rank as far the first of the arts of the second order; and
next to this great art of killing, medicine being much like war in its
stratagems and watchings against its dark and subtle death-enemy.Then the arts of the first order will be those in which the Imaginative
part of the intellect and the Sensitive part of the soul are joined: as
poetry, architecture, and painting; these forming a kind of cross, in
their part of the scheme of the human being, with those of the second
order, which wed the Intelligent part of the intellect and Resolute part
of the soul.But the reader must feel more and more, at every step, the
impossibility of classing the arts themselves, independently of the men
by whom they are practised; and how an art, low in itself, may be made
noble by the quantity of human strength and being which a great man will
pour into it; and an art, great in itself, be made mean by the meanness
of the mind occupied in it.I do not intend, when I call painting an art
of the first, and war an art of the second, order, to class Dutch
landscape painters with good soldiers; but I mean, that if from such a
man as Napoleon we were to take away the honor of all that he had done
in law and civil government, and to give him the reputation of his
soldiership only, his name would be less, if justly weighed, than that
of Buonarroti, himself a good soldier also, when need was.But I will
not endeavor to pursue the inquiry, for I believe that of all the arts
of the first order it would be found that all that a man has, or is, or
can be, he can fully express in them, and give to any of them, and find
it not enough.The same rapid judgment which I wish to enable the reader to form of
architecture, may in some sort also be formed of painting, owing to the
close connection between execution and expression in the latter; as
between structure and expression in the former.We ought to be able to
tell good painting by a side glance as we pass along a gallery; and,
until we can do so, we are not fit to pronounce judgment at all: not
that I class this easily visible excellence of painting with the great
expressional qualities which time and watchfulness only unfold.I have
again and again insisted on the supremacy of these last and shall
always continue to do so.But I perceive a tendency among some of the
more thoughtful critics of the day to forget that the business of a
painter is to _paint_, and so altogether to despise those men, Veronese
and Rubens for instance, who were painters, par excellence, and in whom
the expressional qualities are subordinate.Now it is well, when we have
strong moral or poetical feeling manifested in painting, to mark this as
the best part of the work; but it is not well to consider as a thing of
small account, the painter's language in which that feeling is conveyed,
for if that language be not good and lovely, the man may indeed be a
just moralist or a great poet, but he is not a _painter_, and it was
wrong of him to paint.He had much better put his morality into sermons,
and his poetry into verse, than into a language of which he was not
master.And this mastery of the language is that of which we should be
cognizant by a glance of the eye; and if that be not found, it is wasted
time to look farther: the man has mistaken his vocation, and his
expression of himself will be cramped by his awkward efforts to do what
he was not fit to do.On the other hand, if the man be a painter indeed,
and have the gift of colors and lines, what is in him will come from his
hand freely and faithfully; and the language itself is so difficult and
so vast, that the mere possession of it argues the man is great, and
that his works are worth reading.So that I have never yet seen the case
in which this true artistical excellence, visible by the eye-glance, was
not the index of some true expressional worth in the work.Neither have
I ever seen a good expressional work without high artistical merit: and
that this is ever denied is only owing to the narrow view which men are
apt to take both of expression and of art; a narrowness consequent on
their own especial practice and habits of thought.A man long trained to
love the monk's visions of Fra Angelico, turns in proud and ineffable
disgust from the first work of Rubens which he encounters on his return
across the Alps.He has forgotten,
that while Angelico prayed and wept in his _olive shade_, there was
different work doing in the dank fields of Flanders;--wild seas to be
banked out; endless canals to be dug, and boundless marshes to be
drained; hard ploughing and harrowing of the frosty clay; careful
breeding of stout horses and fat cattle; close setting of brick walls
against cold winds and snow; much hardening of hands and gross
stoutening of bodies in all this; gross jovialities of harvest homes and
Christmas feasts, which were to be the reward of it; rough affections,
and sluggish imagination; fleshy, substantial, ironshod humanities, but
humanities still; humanities which God had his eye upon, and which won,
perhaps, here and there, as much favor in his sight as the wasted
aspects of the whispering monks of Florence (Heaven forbid it should not
be so, since the most of us cannot be monks, but must be ploughmen and
reapers still).And are we to suppose there is no nobility in Rubens'
masculine and universal sympathy with all this, and with his large human
rendering of it, Gentleman though he was, by birth, and feeling, and
education, and place; and, when he chose, lordly in conception also?He
had his faults, perhaps great and lamentable faults, though more those
of his time and his country than his own; he has neither cloister
breeding nor boudoir breeding, and is very unfit to paint either in
missals or annuals; but he has an open sky and wide-world breeding in
him, that we may not be offended with, fit alike for king's court,
knight's camp, or peasant's cottage.On the other hand, a man trained
here in England, in our Sir Joshua school, will not and cannot allow
that there is any art at all in the technical work of Angelico.But he
is just as wrong as the other.Fra Angelico is as true a master of the
art necessary to his purposes, as Rubens was of that necessary for his.We have been taught in England to think there can be no virtue but in a
loaded brush and rapid hand; but if we can shake our common sense free
of such teaching, we shall understand that there is art also in the
delicate point and in the hand which trembles as it moves; not because
it is more liable to err, but because there is more danger in its error,
and more at stake upon its precision.The art of Angelico, both as a
colorist and a draughtsman, is consummate; so perfect and beautiful,
that his work may be recognised at any distance by the rainbow-play and
brilliancy of it: However closely it may be surrounded by other works of
the same school, glowing with enamel and gold, Angelico's may be told
from them at a glance, like so many huge pieces of opal lying among
common marbles.So again with Giotto; the Arena chapel is not only the
most perfect expressional work, it is the prettiest piece of wall
decoration and fair color, in North Italy.Now there is a correspondence of the same kind between the technical and
expressional parts of architecture;--not a true or entire
correspondence, so that when the expression is best, the building must
be also best; but so much of correspondence as that good building is
necessary to good expression, comes before it, and is to be primarily
looked for: and the more, because the manner of building is capable of
being determinately estimated and classed; but the expressional
character not so: we can at once determine the true value of technical
qualities, we can only approximate to the value of expressional
qualities: and besides this, the looking for the technical qualities
first will enable us to cast a large quantity of rubbish aside at once,
and so to narrow the difficult field of inquiry into expression: we
shall get rid of Chinese pagodas and Indian temples, and Renaissance
Palladianisms, and Alhambra stucco and filigree, in one great rubbish
heap; and shall not need to trouble ourselves about their expression, or
anything else concerning them.Then taking the buildings which have been
rightly put together, and which show common sense in their structure, we
may look for their farther and higher excellences; but on those which
are absurd in their first steps we need waste no time.I could have wished, before writing this chapter, to have given more
study to the difficult subject of the strength of shafts of different
materials and structure; but I cannot enter into every inquiry which
general criticism might suggest, and this I believe to be one which
would have occupied the reader with less profit than many others: all
that is necessary for him to note is, that the great increase of
strength gained by a tubular form in iron shafts, of given solid
contents, is no contradiction to the general principle stated in the
text, that the strength of materials is most available when they are
most concentrated.The strength of the tube is owing to certain
properties of the arch formed by its sides, not to the dispersion of its
materials: and the principle is altogether inapplicable to stone shafts.No one would think of building a pillar of a succession of sandstone
rings; however strong it might be, it would be still stronger filled up,
and the substitution of such a pillar for a solid one of the same
contents would lose too much space; for a stone pillar, even when solid,
must be quite as thick as is either graceful or convenient, and in
modern churches is often too thick as it is, hindering sight of the
preacher, and checking the sound of his voice.Some three months ago, and long after the writing of this passage, I met
accidentally with Mr.If I had cared about the reputation of originality, I should have
been annoyed--and was so, at first, on finding Mr.Garbett's
illustrations of the subject exactly the same as mine, even to the
choice of the elephant's foot for the parallel of the Doric pillar: I
even thought of omitting, or rewriting, great part of the chapter, but
determined at last to let it stand.I am striving to speak plain truths
on many simple and trite subjects, and I hope, therefore, that much of
what I say has been said before, and am quite willing to give up all
claim to originality in any reasoning or assertion whatsoever, if any
one cares to dispute it.I desire the reader to accept what I say, not
as mine, but as the truth, which may be all the world's, if they look
for it.Frank Howard promised at some
discussion respecting the "Seven Lamps," reported in the "Builder," to
pluck all my borrowed feathers off me; but I did not see the end of the
discussion, and do not know to this day how many feathers I have left:
at all events the elephant's foot must belong to Mr.Garbett, though,
strictly speaking, neither he nor I can be quite justified in using it,
for an elephant in reality stands on tiptoe; and this is by no means the
expression of a Doric shaft.As, however, I have been obliged to speak
of this treatise of Mr.Garbett's, and desire also to recommend it as of
much interest and utility in its statements of fact, it is impossible
for me to pass altogether without notice, as if unanswerable, several
passages in which the writer has objected to views stated in the "Seven
Lamps."I should at any rate have noticed the passage quoted above,
(Chap.30th,) which runs counter to the spirit of all I have ever
written, though without referring to me; but the references to the
"Seven Lamps" I should not have answered, unless I had desired,
generally, to recommend the book, and partly also, because they may
serve as examples of the kind of animadversion which the "Seven Lamps"
had to sustain from architects, very generally; which examples being
once answered, there will be little occasion for my referring in future
to other criticisms of the kind.The first reference to the "Seven Lamps" is in the second page, where
Mr.Garbett asks a question, "Why are not convenience and stability
enough to constitute a fine building?"--which I should have answered
shortly by asking another, "Why we have been made men, and not bees nor
termites:" but Mr.Garbett has given a very pretty, though partial,
answer to it himself, in his 4th to 9th pages,--an answer which I
heartily beg the reader to consider.But, in page 12, it is made a grave
charge against me, that I use the words beauty and ornament
interchangeably.I do so, and ever shall; and so, I believe, one day,
will Mr.Garbett himself; but not while he continues to head his pages
thus:--"Beauty not dependent on ornament, _or superfluous_ features."What right has he to assume that ornament, rightly so called, ever was,
or can be, superfluous?I have said before, and repeatedly in other
places, that the most beautiful things are the most useless; I never
said superfluous.I said useless in the well-understood and usual sense,
as meaning, inapplicable to the service of the body.Thus I called
peacocks and lilies useless; meaning, that roast peacock was unwholesome
(taking Juvenal's word for it), and that dried lilies made bad hay: but
I do not think peacocks superfluous birds, nor that the world could get
on well without its lilies.Or, to look closer, I suppose the peacock's
blue eyes to be very useless to him; not dangerous indeed, as to their
first master, but of small service, yet I do not think there is a
superfluous eye in all his tail; and for lilies, though the great King
of Israel was not "arrayed" like one of them, can Mr.Garbett tell us
which are their superfluous leaves?Is there no Diogenes among lilies?none to be found content to drink dew, but out of silver?The fact is, I
never met with the architect yet who did not think ornament meant a
thing to be bought in a shop and pinned on, or left off, at
architectural toilets, as the fancy seized them, thinking little more
than many women do of the other kind of ornament--the only true
kind,--St.Peter's kind,--"Not that outward adorning, but the inner--of
the heart."I do not mean that architects cannot conceive this better
ornament, but they do not understand that it is the _only_ ornament;
that _all_ architectural ornament is this, and nothing but this; that a
noble building never has any extraneous or superfluous ornament; that
all its parts are necessary to its loveliness, and that no single atom
of them could be removed without harm to its life.You do not build a
temple and then dress it.[101] You create it in its loveliness, and
leave it, as her Maker left Eve.Not unadorned, I believe, but so well
adorned as to need no feather crowns.And I use the words ornament and
beauty interchangeably, in order that architects may understand this: I
assume that their building is to be a perfect creature capable of
nothing less than it has, and needing nothing more.It may, indeed,
receive additional decoration afterwards, exactly as a woman may
gracefully put a bracelet on her arm, or set a flower in her hair: but
that additional decoration is _not_ the _architecture_.It is of
curtains, pictures, statues, things that may be taken away from the
building, and not hurt it.He
has only to do with what is part of the building itself, that is to say,
its own inherent beauty.Garbett does not understand or
acknowledge this, he is led on from error to error; for we next find him
endeavoring to define beauty as distinct from ornament, and saying that
"Positive beauty may be produced by a studious collation of whatever
will display design, order, and congruity."There
is a highly studious collation of whatever will display design, order,
and congruity, in a skull, is there not?--yet small beauty.The nose is
a decorative feature,--yet slightly necessary to beauty, it seems to me;
now, at least, for I once thought I must be wrong in considering a skull
disagreeable.I gave it fair trial: put one on my bed-room
chimney-piece, and looked at it by sunrise every morning, and by
moonlight every night, and by all the best lights I could think of, for
a month, in vain.I found it as ugly at last as I did at first.So,
also, the hair is a decoration, and its natural curl is of little use;
but can Mr.Garbett conceive a bald beauty; or does he prefer a wig,
because that is a "_studious_ collation" of whatever will produce
design, order, and congruity?So the flush of the cheek is a
decoration,--God's painting of the temple of his spirit,--and the
redness of the lip; and yet poor Viola thought it beauty truly blent;
and I hold with her.The second point questioned is my assertion, "Ornament cannot be
overcharged if it is good, and is always overcharged when it is bad."Garbett objects in these terms: "I must contend, on the
contrary, that the very best ornament may be overcharged by being
misplaced."Garbett cannot get rid of his unfortunate notion that
ornament is a thing to be manufactured separately, and fastened on.He
supposes that an ornament may be called good in itself, in the
stonemason's yard or in the ironmonger's shop: Once for all, let him put
this idea out of his head.We may say of a thing, considered separately,
that it is a pretty thing; but before we can say it is a good ornament,
we must know what it is to adorn, and how.As, for instance, a ring of
gold is a pretty thing; it is a good ornament on a woman's finger; not a
good ornament hung through her under lip.A hollyhock, seven feet high,
would be a good ornament for a cottage-garden; not a good ornament for a
lady's head-dress.Garbett have seen this without my
showing?and that, therefore, when I said "_good_" ornament, I said
"well-placed" ornament, in one word, and that, also, when Mr.Garbett
says "it may be overcharged by being misplaced," he merely says it may
be overcharged by being _bad_.But, granted that ornament _were_ independent of its position,
and might be pronounced good in a separate form, as books are good, or
men are good.--Suppose I had written to a student in Oxford, "You cannot
have too many books, if they be good books;" and he had answered me,
"Yes, for if I have many, I have no place to put them in but the
coal-cellar."Would that in anywise affect the general principle that
he could not have too many books?Or suppose he had written, "I must not have too many, they confuse my
head."I should have written back to him: "Don't buy books to put in the
coal-hole, nor read them if they confuse your head; you cannot have too
many, if they be good: but if you are too lazy to take care of them, or
too dull to profit by them, you are better without them."Exactly in the same tone, I repeat to Mr.Garbett, "You cannot have too
much ornament, if it be good: but if you are too indolent to arrange it,
or too dull to take advantage of it, assuredly you are better without
it."The other points bearing on this question have already been stated in
the close of the 21st chapter.The third reference I have to answer, is to my repeated assertion, that
the evidence of manual labor is one of the chief sources of value in
ornament, ("Seven Lamps," p.III.,)
to which objection is made in these terms: "We must here warn the reader
against a remarkable error of Ruskin.The value of ornaments in
architecture depends _not in the slightest degree_ on the _manual labor_
they contain.If it did, the finest ornaments ever executed would be the
stone chains that hang before certain Indian rock-temples.""The value of the Cornish mines depends not in
the slightest degree on the quantity of copper they contain.If it did,
the most valuable things ever produced would be copper saucepans."It is
hardly worth my while to answer this; but, lest any of my readers should
be confused by the objection, and as I hold the fact to be of great
importance, I may re-state it for them with some explanation.Observe, then, the appearance of labor, that is to say, the evidence of
the past industry of man, is always, in the abstract, intensely
delightful: man being meant to labor, it is delightful to see that he
_has_ labored, and to read the record of his active and worthy
existence.The evidence of labor becomes painful only when it is a _sign of Evil
greater, as Evil, than the labor is great, as Good_.As, for instance,
if a man has labored for an hour at what might have been done by another
man in a moment, this evidence of his labor is also evidence of his
weakness; and this weakness is greater in rank of evil, than his
industry is great in rank of good.Again, if a man have labored at what was not worth accomplishing, the
signs of his labor are the signs of his folly, and his folly dishonors
his industry; we had rather he had been a wise man in rest than a fool
in labor.Again, if a man have labored without accomplishing anything, the signs
of his labor are the signs of his disappointment; and we have more
sorrow in sympathy with his failure, than pleasure in sympathy with his
work.Now, therefore, in ornament, whenever labor replaces what was better
than labor, that is to say, skill and thought; wherever it substitutes
itself for these, or _negatives these by its existence_, then it is
positive evil.Copper is an evil when it alloys gold, or poisons food:
not an evil, as copper; good in the form of pence, seriously
objectionable when it occupies the room of guineas.Let Danae cast it
out of her lap, when the gold comes from heaven; but let the poor man
gather it up carefully from the earth.Farther, the evidence of labor is not only a good when added to other
good, but the utter absence of it destroys good in human work.It is
only good for God to create without toil; that which man can create
without toil is worthless: machine ornaments are no ornaments at all.Consider this carefully, reader: I could illustrate it for you
endlessly; but you feel it yourself every hour of your existence.And if
you do not know that you feel it, take up, for a little time, the trade
which of all manual trades has been most honored: be for once a
carpenter.Make for yourself a table or a chair, and see if you ever
thought any table or chair so delightful, and what strange beauty there
will be in their crooked limbs.I have not noticed any other animadversions on the "Seven Lamps" in Mr.Garbett's volume; but if there be more, I must now leave it to his own
consideration, whether he may not, as in the above instances, have made
them incautiously: I may, perhaps, also be permitted to request other
architects, who may happen to glance at the preceding pages, not
immediately to condemn what may appear to them false in general
principle.I must often be found deficient in technical knowledge; I
may often err in my statements respecting matters of practice or of
special law.But I do not write thoughtlessly respecting principles; and
my statements of these will generally be found worth reconnoitring
before attacking.Architects, no doubt, fancy they have strong grounds
for supposing me wrong when they seek to invalidate my assertions.Let
me assure them, at least, that I mean to be their friend, although they
may not immediately recognise me as such.If I could obtain the public
ear, and the principles I have advocated were carried into general
practice, porphyry and serpentine would be given to them instead of
limestone and brick; instead of tavern and shop-fronts they would have
to build goodly churches and noble dwelling-houses; and for every
stunted Grecism and stucco Romanism, into which they are now forced to
shape their palsied thoughts, and to whose crumbling plagiarisms they
must trust their doubtful fame, they would be asked to raise whole
streets of bold, and rich, and living architecture, with the certainty
in their hearts of doing what was honorable to themselves, and good for
all men.Before I altogether leave the question of the influence of labor on
architectural effect, the reader may expect from me a word or two
respecting the subject which this year must be interesting to all--the
applicability, namely, of glass and iron to architecture in general, as
in some sort exemplified by the Crystal Palace.It is thought by many that we shall forthwith have great part of our
architecture in glass and iron, and that new forms of beauty will result
from the studied employment of these materials.It may be told in a few words how far this is possible; how far
eternally impossible.There are two means of delight in all productions of art--color and
form.The most vivid conditions of color attainable by human art are those of
works in glass and enamel, but not the most perfect.The best and
noblest coloring possible to art is that attained by the touch of the
human hand on an opaque surface, upon which it can command any tint
required, without subjection to alteration by fire or other mechanical
means.No color is so noble as the color of a good painting on canvas or
gesso.This kind of color being, however, impossible, for the most part, in
architecture, the next best is the scientific disposition of the natural
colors of stones, which are far nobler than any abstract hues producible
by human art.The delight which we receive from glass painting is one altogether
inferior, and in which we should degrade ourselves by over indulgence.Nevertheless, it is possible that we may raise some palaces like
Aladdin's with  glass for jewels, which shall be new in the annals
of human splendor, and good in their place; but not if they superseded
nobler edifices.Now, color is producible either on opaque or in transparent bodies: but
form is only expressible, in its perfection, on opaque bodies, without
lustre.This law is imperative, universal, irrevocable.No perfect or refined
form can be expressed except in opaque and lustreless matter.You cannot
see the form of a jewel, nor, in any perfection, even of a cameo or
bronze.You cannot perfectly see the form of a humming-bird, on account
of its burnishing; but you can see the form of a swan perfectly.No noble
work in form can ever, therefore, be produced in transparent or lustrous
glass or enamel.All noble architecture depends for its majesty on its
form: therefore you can never have any noble architecture in transparent
or lustrous glass or enamel.Iron is, however, opaque; and both it and
opaque enamel may, perhaps, be rendered quite lustreless; and, therefore,
fit to receive noble form.Let this be thoroughly done, and both the iron and enamel made fine in
paste or grain, and you may have an architecture as noble as cast or
struck architecture even can be: as noble, therefore, as coins can be, or
common cast bronzes, and such other multiplicable things;[102]--eternally
separated from all good and great things by a gulph which not all the
tubular bridges nor engineering of ten thousand nineteenth centuries cast
into one great bronze-foreheaded century, will ever overpass one inch of.All art which is worth its room in this world, all art which is not a
piece of blundering refuse, occupying the foot or two of earth which, if
unencumbered by it, would have grown corn or violets, or some better
thing, is _art which proceeds from an individual mind, working through
instruments which assist, but do not supersede, the muscular action of
the human hand, upon the materials which most tenderly receive, and most
securely retain, the impressions of such human labor_.And the value of every work of art is exactly in the ratio of the
quantity of humanity which has been put into it, and legibly expressed
upon it for ever:--

First, of thought and moral purpose;

Secondly, of technical skill;

Thirdly, of bodily industry.The quantity of bodily industry which that Crystal Palace expresses is
very great.The quantity of thought it expresses is, I suppose, a single and very
admirable thought of Mr.Paxton's, probably not a bit brighter than
thousands of thoughts which pass through his active and intelligent
brain every hour,--that it might be possible to build a greenhouse
larger than ever greenhouse was built before.This thought, and some
very ordinary algebra, are as much as all that glass can represent of
human intellect."But one poor half-pennyworth of bread to all this
intolerable deal of sack.""The earth hath bubbles as the water hath:
   And this is of them."The depth of the cutting in some of the early English capitals is,
indeed, part of a general system of attempts at exaggerated force of
effect, like the "_black_ touches" of second-rate draughtsmen, which I
have noticed as characteristic of nearly all northern work, associated
with the love of the grotesque: but the main section of the capital is
indeed a dripstone rolled round, as above described; and dripstone
sections are continually found in northern work, where not only they
cannot increase force of effect, but are entirely invisible except on
close examination; as, for instance, under the uppermost range of stones
of the foundation of Whitehall, or under the <DW72> of the restored base
of All Souls College, Oxford, under the level of the eye.I much doubt
if any of the Fellows be aware of its existence.Many readers will be surprised and displeased by the disparagement of
the early English capital.That capital has, indeed, one character of
considerable value; namely, the boldness with which it stops the
mouldings which fall upon it, and severs them from the shaft,
contrasting itself with the multiplicity of their vertical lines.Sparingly used, or seldom seen, it is thus, in its place, not
unpleasing; and we English love it from association, it being always
found in connection with our purest and loveliest Gothic arches, and
never in multitudes large enough to satiate the eye with its form.The
reader who sits in the Temple church every Sunday, and sees no
architecture during the week but that of Chancery Lane, may most
justifiably quarrel with me for what I have said of it.But if every
house in Fleet Street or Chancery Lane were Gothic, and all had early
English capitals, I would answer for his making peace with me in a
fortnight.Whose they are, is of little consequence to the reader or to me, and I
have taken no pains to discover; their value being not in any evidence
they bear respecting dates, but in their intrinsic merit as examples of
composition.Two of them are within the gate, one on the top of it, and
this latter is on the whole the best, though all are beautiful; uniting
the intense northern energy in their figure sculpture with the most
serene classical restraint in their outlines, and unaffected, but
masculine simplicity of construction.I have not put letters to the diagram of the lateral arch at page 154,
in order not to interfere with the clearness of the curves, but I shall
always express the same points by the same letters, whenever I have to
give measures of arches of this simple kind, so that the reader need
never have the diagrams lettered at all.The base or span of the centre
arch will always be _a b_; its vertex will always be V; the points of
the cusps will be _c c_; _p p_ will be the bases of perpendiculars let
fall from V and _c_ on _a b_; and _d_ the base of a perpendicular from
the point of the cusp to the arch line.Then _a b_ will always be a span
of the arch, V _p_ its perpendicular height, V _a_ the chord of its side
arcs, _d c_ the depth of its cusps, _c c_ the horizontal interval
between the cusps, _a c_ the length of the chord of the lower arc of the
cusp, V _c_ the length of the chord of the upper arc of the cusp,
(whether continuous or not,) and _c p_ the length of a perpendicular
from the point of the cusp on _a b_.Of course we do not want all these measures for a single arch, but it
often happens that some of them are attainable more easily than others;
some are often unattainable altogether, and it is necessary therefore to
have expressions for whichever we may be able to determine.V _p_ or V _a_, _a b_, and _d c_ are always essential; then either _a c_
and V _c_ or _c c_ and _c p_: when I have my choice, I always take _a
b_, V _p_, _d c_, _c c_, and _c p_, but _c p_ is not to be generally
obtained so accurately as the cusp arcs.The measures of the present arch are:

           Ft._a b_,    3,, 8
  V _p_,    4,, 0
  V _c_,    2,, 4-1/2
  _a c_,    2,, 0-1/4
  _d c_,    0,, 3-1/2


                   20.SHAFTS OF DUCAL PALACE.The shortness of the thicker ones at the angles is induced by the
greater depth of the enlarged capitals: thus the 36th shaft is 10 ft.in circumference at its base, and 10,, 0-1/2[103] in
circumference under the fillet of its capital; but it is only 6,,
1-3/4 high, while the minor intermediate shafts, of which the thickest
is 7,, 8 round at the base, and 7,, 4 under capital, are yet on the
average 7,, 7 high.The angle shaft towards the sea (the 18th) is
nearly of the proportions of the 36th, and there are three others, the
15th, 24th, and 26th, which are thicker than the rest, though not so
thick as the angle ones.The 24th and 26th have both party walls to
bear, and I imagine the 15th must in old time have carried another,
reaching across what is now the Sala del Gran Consiglio.They measure respectively round at the base,

  The 15th, 8,, 2
      24th, 9,, 6-1/2
      26th, 8,, 0-1/2

The other pillars towards the sea, and those to the 27th inclusive of
the Piazzetta, are all seven feet round at the base, and then there is a
most curious and delicate crescendo of circumference to the 36th, thus:

  The 28th, 7,, 3   The 33rd, 7,, 6
      29th, 7,, 4       34th, 7,, 8
      30th, 7,, 6       35th, 7,, 8
      31st, 7,, 7       36th, 10,, 4-1/3
      32nd, 7,, 5

The shafts of the upper arcade, which are above these thicker columns,
are also thicker than their companions, measuring on the average, 4,,
8-1/2 in circumference, while those of the sea facade, except the 29th,
average 4,, 7-1/2 in circumference.The 29th, which is of course above
the 15th of the lower story, is 5,, 5 in circumference, which little
piece of evidence will be of no small value to us by-and-by.The 35th
carries the angle of the palace, and is 6,, 0 round.The 47th, which
comes above the 24th and carries the party wall of the Sala del Gran
Consiglio, is strengthened by a pilaster; and the 51st, which comes over
the 26th, is 5,, 4-1/2 round, or nearly the same as the 29th; it
carries the party wall of the Sala del Scrutinio; a small room
containing part of St.Mark's library, coming between the two saloons;
a room which, in remembrances of the help I have received in all my
inquiries from the kindness and intelligence of its usual occupant, I
shall never easily distinguish otherwise than as "Mr."[104]

I may as well connect with these notes respecting the arcades of the
Ducal Palace, those which refer to Plate XIV., which represents one of
its spandrils.Every spandril of the lower arcade was intended to have
been occupied by an ornament resembling the one given in that plate.The
mass of the building being of Istrian stone, a depth of about two inches
is left within the mouldings of the arches, rough hewn, to receive the
slabs of fine marble composing the patterns.I cannot say whether the
design was ever completed, or the marbles have been since removed, but
there are now only two spandrils retaining their fillings, and vestiges
of them in a third.The two complete spandrils are on the sea facade,
above the 3rd and 10th capitals (_vide_ method of numbering, Chap.I.,
page 30); that is to say, connecting the 2nd arch with the 3rd, and the
9th with the 10th.The latter is the one given in Plate XIV.The white
portions of it are all white marble, the dental band surrounding the
circle is in coarse sugary marble, which I believe to be Greek, and
never found in Venice to my recollection, except in work at least
anterior to the fifteenth century.The shaded fields charged with the
three white triangles are of red Verona marble; the inner disc is green
serpentine, and the dark pieces of the radiating leaves are grey marble.The two uppermost are 1,, 5 each
side, and the lower 1,, 2.The extreme diameter of the circle is 3,, 10-1/2; its field is slightly
raised above the red marbles, as shown in the section at A, on the left.A _a_ is part of the red marble field; _a b_ the section of the dentil
moulding let into it; _b c_ the entire breadth of the rayed zone,
represented on the other side of the spandril by the line C _f_; _c d_
is the white marble band let in, with the dogtooth on the face of it;
_b c_ is 7-3/4 inches across; _c d_ 3-3/4; and at B are given two joints
of the dentil (mentioned above, in the chapter on dentils, as unique in
Venice) of their actual size.At C is given one of the inlaid leaves;
its measure being (in inches) C _f_ 7-3/4; C _h_ 3/4; _f g_ 3/4; _f e_
4-3/4, the base of the smaller leaves being of course _f e_ - _f g_ = 4.The pattern which occupies the other spandril is similar, except that
the field _b c_, instead of the intersecting arcs, has only triangles of
grey marble, arranged like rays, with their bases towards the centre.There being twenty round the circle, the reader can of course draw them
for himself; they being isosceles, touching the dentil with their
points, and being in contact at their bases: it has lost its central
boss.The marbles are, in both, covered with a rusty coating, through
which it is excessively difficult to distinguish the colors (another
proof of the age of the ornament).But the white marbles are certainly,
in places (except only the sugary dentil), veined with purple, and the
grey seem warmed with green.A trace of another of these ornaments may be seen over the 21st capital;
but I doubt if the marbles have ever been inserted in the other
spandrils, and their want of ornament occasions the slight meagreness in
the effect of the lower story, which is almost the only fault of the
building.This decoration by discs, or shield-like ornaments, is a marked
characteristic of Venetian architecture in its earlier ages, and is
carried into later times by the Byzantine Renaissance, already
distinguished from the more corrupt forms of Renaissance, in Appendix 6.Of the disc decoration, so borrowed, we have already an example in Plate
I. In Plate VII.we have an earlier condition of it, one of the discs
being there sculptured, the others surrounded by sculptured bands: here
we have, on the Ducal Palace, the most characteristic of all, because
likest to the shield, which was probably the origin of the same ornament
among the Arabs, and assuredly among the Greeks.Donaldson's
restoration of the gate of the treasury of Atreus, this ornament is
conjecturally employed, and it occurs constantly on the Arabian
buildings of Cairo.ANCIENT REPRESENTATIONS OF WATER.I have long been desirous of devoting some time to an enquiry into the
effect of natural scenery upon the pagan, and especially the Greek,
mind, and knowing that my friend, Mr.C. Newton, had devoted much
thought to the elucidation of the figurative and symbolic language of
ancient art, I asked him to draw up for me a few notes of the facts
which he considered most interesting, as illustrative of its methods of
representing nature.I suggested to him, for an initiative subject, the
representation of water; because this is one of the natural objects
whose portraiture may most easily be made a test of treatment, for it is
one of universal interest, and of more closely similar aspect in all
parts of the world than any other.Waves, currents, and eddies are much
liker each other, everywhere, than either land or vegetation.Rivers and
lakes, indeed, differ widely from the sea, and the clear Pacific from
the angry Northern ocean; but the Nile is liker the Danube than a knot
of Nubian palms is to a glade of the Black Forest; and the Mediterranean
is liker the Atlantic than the Campo Felice is like Solway moss.Newton has accordingly most kindly furnished me with the following
data.One or two of the types which he describes have been already
noticed in the main text; but it is well that the reader should again
contemplate them in the position which they here occupy in a general
system.Newton's definitions of
the terms "figurative" and "symbolic," as applied to art, in the
beginning of the paper.*       *       *       *       *

In ancient art, that is to say, in the art of the Egyptian, Assyrian,
Greek, and Roman races, water is, for the most part, represented
conventionally rather than naturally.By natural representation is here meant as just and perfect an imitation
of nature as the technical means of art will allow: on the other hand,
representation is said to be conventional, either when a confessedly
inadequate imitation is accepted in default of a better, or when
imitation is not attempted at all, and it is agreed that other modes of
representation, those by figures or by symbols, shall be its substitute
and equivalent.In figurative representation there is always _impersonation_; the
sensible form, borrowed by the artist from organic life, is conceived to
be actuated by a will, and invested with such mental attributes as
constitute personality.The sensible _symbol_, whether borrowed from organic or from inorganic
nature, is not a personification at all, but the conventional sign or
equivalent of some object or notion, to which it may perhaps bear no
visible resemblance, but with which the intellect or the imagination has
in some way associated it.For instance, a city may be figuratively represented as a woman crowned
with towers; here the artist has selected for the expression of his idea
a human form animated with a will and motives of action analogous to
those of humanity generally.Or, again, as in Greek art, a bull may be a
figurative representation of a river, and, in the conception of the
artist, this animal form may contain, and be ennobled by, a human mind.This is still impersonation; the form only in which personality is
embodied is changed.Again, a dolphin may be used as a symbol of the sea; a man ploughing
with two oxen is a well-known symbol of a Roman colony.In neither of
these instances is there impersonation.The dolphin is not invested,
like the figure of Neptune, with any of the attributes of the human
mind; it has animal instincts, but no will; it represents to us its
native element, only as a part may be taken for a whole.Again, the man ploughing does not, like the turreted female figure,
_personify_, but rather _typifies_ the town, standing as the visible
representation of a real event, its first foundation.To our mental
perceptions, as to our bodily senses, this figure seems no more than
man; there is no blending of his personal nature with the impersonal
nature of the colony, no transfer of attributes from the one to the
other.Though the conventionally imitative, the figurative, and the symbolic,
are three distinct kinds of representation, they are constantly combined
in one composition, as we shall see in the following examples, cited
from the art of successive races in chronological order.In Egyptian art the general representation of water is the
conventionally imitative.In the British Museum are two frescoes from
tombs at Thebes, Nos.177 and 170: the subject of the first of these is
an oblong pond, ground-plan and elevation being strangely confused in
the design.In this pond water is represented by parallel zigzag lines,
in which fish are swimming about.On the surface are birds and lotos
flowers; the herbage at the edge of the pond is represented by a border
of symmetrical fan-shaped flowers; the field beyond by rows of trees,
arranged round the sides of the pond at right angles to each other, and
in defiance of all laws of perspective.170, we have the representation of a river with
papyrus on its bank.Here the water is rendered by zigzag lines arranged
vertically and in parallel lines, so as to resemble herring-bone
masonry, thus.There are fish in this fresco as in the preceding, and in
both each fish is drawn very distinctly, not as it would appear to the
eye viewed through water.The mode of representing this element in
Egyptian painting is further abbreviated in their hieroglyphic writing,
where the sign of water is a zigzag line; this line is, so to speak, a
picture of water written in short hand.In the Egyptian Pantheon there
was but one aquatic deity, the god of the Nile; his type is, therefore,
the only figurative representation of water in Egyptian art.(Birch,
"Gallery of British Museum Antiquities," Pl.In Assyrian sculpture
we have very curious conventionally imitative representations of water.On several of the friezes from Nimroud and Khorsabad, men are seen
crossing a river in boats, or in skins, accompanied by horses swimming
(see Layard, ii.In these scenes water is represented by masses
of wavy lines somewhat resembling tresses of hair, and terminating in
curls or volutes; these wavy lines express the general character of a
deep and rapid current, like that of the Tigris.Fish are but sparingly
introduced, the idea of surface being sufficiently expressed by the
floating figures and boats.In the representation of these there is the
same want of perspective as in the Egyptian fresco which we have just
cited.In the Assyrian Pantheon one aquatic deity has been discovered, the god
Dagon, whose human form terminates in a fish's tail.Of the character
and attributes of this deity we know but little.The more abbreviated mode of representing water, the zigzag line, occurs
on the large silver coins with the type of a city or a war galley (see
Layard, ii.These coins were probably struck in Assyria, not
long after the conquest of it by the Persians.In Greek art the modes of representing water are far more varied.Two
conventional imitations, the wave moulding and the Maeander, are well
known.Both are probably of the most remote antiquity; both have been
largely employed as an architectural ornament, and subordinately as a
decoration of vases, costume, furniture and implements.In the wave
moulding we have a conventional representation of the small crisping
waves which break upon the shore of the Mediterranean, the sea of the
Greeks.Their regular succession, and equality of force and volume, are
generalised in this moulding, while the minuter varieties which
distinguish one wave from another are merged in the general type.The
character of ocean waves is to be "for ever changing, yet the same for
ever;" it is this eternity of recurrence which the early artist has
expressed in this hieroglyphic.With this profile representation of water may be compared the sculptured
waves out of which the head and arms of Hyperion are rising in the
pediment of the Parthenon (Elgin Room, No.(65) 91, Museum Marbles, vi.Phidias has represented these waves like a mass of overlapping
tiles, thus generalising their rippling movement.In the Maeander pattern
the graceful curves of nature are represented by angles, as in the
Egyptian hieroglyphic of water: so again the earliest representation of
the labyrinth on the coins of the Cnossus is rectangular; on later coins
we find the curvilinear form introduced.In the language of Greek mythography, the wave pattern and the Maeander
are sometimes used singly for the idea of water, but more frequently
combined with figurative representation.The number of aquatic deities
in the Greek Pantheon led to the invention of a great variety of
beautiful types.Everybody is
familiar with the general form of Poseidon (Neptune), the Nereids, the
Nymphs and River Gods; but the modes in which these types were combined
with conventional imitation and with accessory symbols deserve careful
study, if we would appreciate the surpassing richness and beauty of the
language of art formed out of these elements.This class of representations may be divided into two principal groups,
those relating to the sea, and those relating to fresh water.The power of the ocean and the great features of marine scenery are
embodied in such types as Poseidon, Nereus and the Nereids, that is to
say, in human forms moving through the liquid element in chariots, or on
the back of dolphins, or who combine the human form with that of the
fish-like Tritons.The sea-monsters who draw these chariots are called
Hippocamps, being composed of the tail of a fish and the fore-part of a
horse, the legs terminating in web-feet: this union seems to express
speed and power under perfect control, such as would characterise the
movements of sea deities.A few examples have been here selected to show
how these types were combined with symbols and conventional imitation.In the British Museum is a vase, No.1257, engraved (Lenormant et De
Witte, Mon.27), of which the subject is, Europa crossing
the sea on the back of the bull.In this design the sea is represented
by a variety of expedients.First, the swimming action of the bull
suggests the idea of the liquid medium through which he moves.Behind
him stands Nereus, his staff held perpendicularly in his hand; the top
of his staff comes nearly to the level of the bull's back, and is
probably meant as the measure of the whole depth of the sea.Towards the
surface line thus indicated a dolphin is rising; in the middle depth is
another dolphin; below a shrimp and a cuttle-fish, and the bottom is
indicated by a jagged line of rocks, on which are two echini.On a mosaic found at Oudnah in Algeria (Revue Archeol., iii.50), we
have a representation of the sea, remarkable for the fulness of details
with which it is made out.This, though of the Roman period, is so thoroughly Greek in feeling,
that it may be cited as an example of the class of mythography now under
consideration.The mosaic lines the floor and sides of a bath, and, as
was commonly the case in the baths of the ancients, serves as a
figurative representation of the water it contained.On the sides are hippocamps, figures riding on dolphins, and islands on
which fishermen stand; on the floor are fish, crabs, and shrimps.These, as in the vase with Europa, indicate the bottom of the sea: the
same symbols of the submarine world appear on many other ancient
designs.Thus in vase pictures, when Poseidon upheaves the island of Cos
to overwhelm the Giant Polydotes, the island is represented as an
immense mass of rock; the parts which have been under water are
indicated by a dolphin, a shrimp, and a sepia, the parts above the water
by a goat and a serpent (Lenormant et De Witte, i., tav.Sometimes these symbols occur singly in Greek art, as the types, for
instance, of coins.In such cases they cannot be interpreted without
being viewed in relation to the whole context of mythography to which
they belong.If we find, for example, on one coin of Tarentum a shell,
on another a dolphin, on a third a figure of Tarus, the mythic founder
of the town, riding on a dolphin in the midst of the waves, and this
latter group expresses the idea of the town itself and its position on
the coast, then we know the two former types to be but portions of the
greater design, having been detached from it, as we may detach words
from sentences.The study of the fuller and clearer examples, such as we have cited
above, enables us to explain many more compendious forms of expression.We have, for instance, on coins several representations of ancient
harbors.Of these, the earliest occurs on the coins of Zancle, the modern Messina
in Sicily.The ancients likened the form of this harbor to a sickle, and
on the coins of the town we find a curved object, within the area of
which is a dolphin.On this curve are four square elevations placed at
equal distances.It has been conjectured that these projections are
either towers or the large stones to which galleys were moored still to
be seen in ancient harbors (see Burgon, Numismatic Chronicle, iii.With this archaic representation of a harbor may be compared some
examples of the Roman period.Severus struck at
Corinth (Millingen, Sylloge of Uned.30) we have a female figure standing on a rock between two recumbent
male figures holding rudders.From an arch at the foot of the rock a
stream is flowing: this is a representation of the rock of the Acropolis
of Corinth: the female figure is a statue of Aphrodite, whose temple
surmounted the rock.The two
recumbent figures are impersonations of the two harbors, Lechreum and
Cenchreia, between which Corinth was situated.16) describes a similar picture of the Isthmus between the two
harbors, one of which was in the form of a youth, the other of a nymph.On another coin of Corinth we have one of the harbors in a semicircular
form, the whole arc being marked with small equal divisions, to denote
the archways under which the ancient galleys were drawn, _subductae_; at
the either horn or extremity of the harbor is a temple; in the centre of
the mouth, a statue of Neptune.(Millingen, Medailles Ined., Pl.Compare also Millingen, Ancient Coins of Cities and Kings, 1831,
pp.246; and the
harbor of Ostium, on the large brass coins of Nero, in which there is a
representation of the Roman fleet and a reclining figure of Neptune.)In vase pictures we have occasionally an attempt to represent water
naturally.On a vase in the British Museum (No.785), of which the
subject is Ulysses and the Sirens, the Sea is rendered by wavy lines
drawn in black on a red ground, and something like the effect of light
playing on the surface of the water is given.On each side of the ship
are shapeless masses of rock on which the Sirens stand.One of the most beautiful of the figurative representations of the sea
is the well-known type of Scylla.She has a beautiful body, terminating
in two barking dogs and two serpent tails.Sometimes drowning men, the
_rari nantes in gurgite vasto_, appear caught up in the coils of these
tails.Scylla generally brandishes a rudder to show
the manner in which she twists the course of ships.For varieties of her
type see Monum.The representations of fresh water may be arranged under the following
heads--rivers, lakes, fountains.There are several figurative modes of representing rivers very
frequently employed in ancient mythography.In the type which occurs earliest we have the human form combined with
that of the bull in several ways.On an archaic coin of Metapontum in
Lucania, (see frontispiece to Millingen, Ancient Coins of Greek Cities
and Kings,) the river Achelous is represented with the figure of a man
with a shaggy beard and bull's horns and ears.On a vase of the best
period of Greek art (Brit.of
Lit., New Series, Lond.100) the same river is represented
with a satyr's head and long bull's horns on the forehead; his form,
human to the waist, terminates in a fish's tail; his hair falls down his
back; his beard is long and shaggy.In this type we see a combination of
the three forms separately enumerated by Sophocles, in the commencement
of the Trachiniae.[Greek: Acheloon lego,
  os m' en trisin morphaisin exetei patros,
  phoiton enarges auros allot' aiolos,
  drakon heliktos, allot' andreio kytei
  bouproros, ek de daskiou geneiados
  krounoi dierrhainonto krenaiou potou].In a third variety of this type the human-headed body is united at the
waist with the shoulders of a bull's body, in which it terminates.This
occurs on an early vase.On the coins of Oeniadae
in Acarnia, and on those of Ambracia, all of the period after Alexander
the Great, the Achelous has a bull's body, and head with a human face.In this variety of the type the human element is almost absorbed, as in
the first variety cited above, the coin of Metapontum, the bull portion
of the type is only indicated by the addition of the horns and ears to
the human head.On the analogy between these, varieties in the type of
the Achelous and those under which the metamorphoses of the marine
goddess Thetis are represented, see Gerhard, Auserl.It is probable that, in the type of Thetis, of Proteus, and
also of the Achelous, the singular combinations and transformations are
intended to express the changeful nature of the element water.Numerous other examples may be cited, where rivers are represented by
this combination of the bull and human form, which maybe called, for
convenience, the Androtauric type.On the coins of Sicily, of the
archaic and also of the finest period of art, rivers are most usually
represented by a youthful male figure, with small budding horns; the
hair has the lank and matted form which characterises aquatic deities in
Greek mythography.The name of the river is often inscribed round the
head.When the whole figure occurs on the coin, it is always represented
standing, never reclining.The type of the bull on the coins of Sybaris and Thurium, in Magna
Graecia, has been considered, with great probability, a representation of
this kind.On the coins of Sybaris, which are of a very early period,
the head of the bull is turned round; on those of Thurium, he stoops his
head, butting: the first of these actions has been thought to symbolise
the winding course of the river, the second, its headlong current.On
the coins of Thurium, the idea of water is further suggested by the
adjunct of dolphins and other fish in the exergue of the coin.The
ground on which the bull stands is indicated by herbage or pebbles.Two bulls' head occur on the coins
of Sardis, and it has been ingeniously conjectured by Mr.Burgon that
the two rivers of the place are expressed under this type.The representation of river-gods as human figures in a reclining
position, though probably not so much employed in earlier Greek art as
the Androtauric type, is very much more familiar to us, from its
subsequent adoption in Roman mythography.The earliest example we have
of a reclining river-god is in the figure in the Elgin Room commonly
called the Ilissus, but more probably the Cephissus.This occupied one
angle in the western pediment of the Parthenon; the other Athenian
river, the Ilissus, and the fountain Callirrhoe being represented by a
male and female figure in the opposite angle; this group, now destroyed,
is visible in the drawing made by Carrey in 1678.It is probable that the necessities of pedimental composition first led
the artist to place the river-god in a reclining position.The head of
the Ilissus being broken off, we are not sure whether he had bull's
horns, like the Sicilian figures already described.His form is
youthful, in the folds of the drapery behind him there is a flow like
that of waves, but the idea of water is not suggested by any other
symbol.When we compare this figure with that of the Nile (Visconti,
Mus.38), and the figure of the Tiber in the Louvre,
both of which are of the Roman period, we see how in these later types
the artist multiplied symbols and accessories, ingrafting them on the
original simple type of the river-god, as it was conceived by Phidias in
the figure of the Ilissus.The Nile is represented as a colossal bearded
figure reclining.At his side is a cornucopia, full of the vegetable
produce of the Egyptian soil.Round his body are sixteen naked boys, who
represent the sixteen cubits, the height to which the river rose in a
favorable year.The statue is placed on a basement divided into three
compartments, one above another.In the uppermost of these, waves are
flowing over in one great sheet from the side of the river-god.In the
other two compartments are the animals and plants of the river; the
bas-reliefs on this basement are, in fact, a kind of abbreviated
symbolic panorama of the Nile.The Tiber is represented in a very similar manner.On the base are, in
two compartments, scenes taken from the early Roman myths; flocks,
herds, and other objects on the banks of the river.39; Millin, Galerie Mythol., i. p.In the types of the Greek coins of Camarina, we find two interesting
representations of Lakes.On the obverse of one of these we have, within
a circle of the wave pattern, a male head, full face, with dishevelled
hair, and with a dolphin on either side; on the reverse a female figure
sailing on a swan, below which a wave moulding, and above, a dolphin.On another coin the swan type of the reverse is associated with the
youthful head of a river-god, inscribed "Hipparis" on the obverse.On
some smaller coins we have the swan flying over the rippling waves,
which are represented by the wave moulding.When we examine the chart of
Sicily, made by the Admiralty survey, we find marked down at Camarina, a
lake through which the river Hipparis flows.We can hardly doubt that the inhabitants of Camarina represented both
their river and their lakes on their coins.The swan flying over the
waves would represent a lake; the figure associated with it being no
doubt the Aphrodite worshipped at that place: the head, in a circle of
wave pattern, may express that part of the river which flows through the
lake.Fountains are usually represented by a stream of water issuing from a
lion's head in the rock: see a vase (Gerhard, Auserl.), where Hercules stands, receiving a shower-bath from a hot
spring at Thermae in Sicily.On the coins of Syracuse the fountain
Arethusa is represented by a female head seen to the front; the flowing
lines of her dishevelled hair suggest, though they do not directly
imitate, the bubbling action of the fresh-water spring; the sea in which
it rises is symbolized by the dolphins round the head.This type
presents a striking analogy with that of the Camarina head in the circle
of wave pattern described above.These are the principal modes of representing water in Greek
mythography.In the art of the Roman period, the same kind of figurative
and symbolic language is employed, but there is a constant tendency to
multiply accessories and details, as we have shown in the later
representations of harbors and river-gods cited above.In these crowded
compositions the eye is fatigued and distracted by the quantity it has
to examine; the language of art becomes more copious but less terse and
emphatic, and addresses itself to minds far less intelligent than the
refined critics who were the contemporaries of Phidias.Rivers in Roman art are usually represented by reclining male figures,
generally bearded, holding reeds or other plants in their hands, and
leaning on urns from which water is flowing.On the coins of many Syrian
cities, struck in imperial times, the city is represented by a turreted
female figure seated on rocks, and resting her feet on the shoulder of a
youthful male figure, who looks up in her face, stretching out his arms,
and who is sunk in the ground as high as the waist.See Mueller
(Denkmaeler d. A. Kunst, i., taf.220) for a group of this kind
in the Vatican, and several similar designs on coins.On the column of Trajan there occur many rude representations of the
Danube, and other rivers crossed by the Romans in their military
expeditions.The water is imitated by sculptured wavy lines, in which
boats are placed.In one scene (Bartoli, Colonna Trajana, Tav.4) this
rude conventional imitation is combined with a figure.In a recess in
the river bank is a reclining river-god, terminating at the waist.This
is either meant for a statue which was really placed on the bank of the
river, and which therefore marks some particular locality, or we have
here figurative representation blended with conventional imitation.On the column of Antoninus (Bartoli, Colon.15) a storm of
rain is represented by the head of Jupiter Pluvius, who has a vast
outspread beard flowing in long tresses.In the Townley collection, in
the British Museum, is a Roman helmet found at Ribchester in Lancashire,
with a mask or vizor attached.The helmet is richly embossed with
figures in a battle scene; round the brow is a row of turrets; the hair
in the forehead is so treated as to give the idea of waves washing the
base of the turrets.This head is perhaps a figurative representation of
a town girt with fortifications and a moat, near which some great battle
was fought.It is engraved (Vetusta Monum.In the Galeria at Florence is a group in alto relievo (Gori, Inscript.14) of three female figures, one of whom is
certainly Demeter Kourotrophos, or the earth; another, Thetis, or the
sea; the centre of the three seems to represent Aphrodite associated, as
on the coins of Camarina, with the element of fresh water.This figure is seated on a swan, and holds over her head an arched veil.Her hair is bound with reeds; above her veil grows a tall water plant,
and below the swan other water plants, and a stork seated on a _hydria_,
or pitcher, from which water is flowing.The swan, the stork, the water
plants, and the _hydria_ must all be regarded as symbols of fresh water,
the latter emblem being introduced to show that the element is fit for
the use of man.Fountains in Roman art are generally personified as figures of nymphs
reclining with urns, or standing holding before them a large shell.One of the latest representations of water in ancient art is the mosaic
of Palestrina (Barthelemy, in Bartoli, Peint.Antiques) which may be
described as a kind of rude panorama of some district of Upper Egypt, a
bird's-eye view, half man, half picture, in which the details are
neither adjusted to a scale, nor drawn according to perspective, but
crowded together, as they would be in an ancient bas-relief.I do not mean what I have here said of the Inventive power of the Arab
to be understood as in the least applying to the detestable
ornamentation of the Alhambra.[105] The Alhambra is no more
characteristic of Arab work, than Milan Cathedral is of Gothic: it is a
late building, a work of the Spanish dynasty in its last decline, and
its ornamentation is fit for nothing but to be transferred to patterns
of carpets or bindings of books, together with their marbling, and
mottling, and other mechanical recommendations.The Alhambra ornament
has of late been largely used in shop-fronts, to the no small detriment
of Regent Street and Oxford Street.LXXII., be the original angle of the wall.Inscribe
within it a circle, _p_ Q N _p_, of the size of the bead required,
touching A B, A C, in _p_, _p_; join _p_, _p_, and draw B C parallel to
it, touching the circle.Then the lines B C, _p p_ are the limits of the possible chamfers
constructed with curves struck either from centre A, as the line Q _q_,
N _d_, _r u_, _g c_, &c., or from any other point chosen as a centre in
the direction Q A produced: and also of all chamfers in straight lines,
as _a b_, _e f_.There are, of course, an infinite number of chamfers to
be struck between B C and _p p_, from every point in Q A produced to
infinity; thus we have infinity multiplied into infinity to express the
number of possible chamfers of this species, which are peculiarly
Italian chamfers; together with another singly infinite group of the
straight chamfers, _a b_, _e f_, &c., of which the one formed by the
line _a b_, passing through the centre of the circle, is the universal
early Gothic chamfer of Venice.Either on the line A C, or on any other lines A _l_ or A _m_,
radiating from A, any number of centres may be taken, from which, with
any radii not greater than the distance between such points and Q, an
infinite number of curves may be struck, such as _t u_, _r s_, N _n_
(all which are here struck from centres on the line A C).These lines
represent the great class of the northern chamfers, of which the number
is infinity raised to its fourth power, but of which the curve N _n_
(for northern) represents the average condition; the shallower chamfers
of the same group, _r s_, _t u_, &c., occurring often in Italy.The
lines _r u_, _t u_, and _a b_ may be taken approximating to the most
frequent conditions of the southern chamfer.It is evident that the chords of any of these curves will give a
relative group of rectilinear chamfers, occurring both in the North and
South; but the rectilinear chamfers, I think, invariably fall within the
line Q C, and are either parallel with it, or inclined to A C at an
angle greater than A C Q, and often perpendicular to it; but never
inclined to it at an angle less than A C Q.The following extract from my note-book refers also to some features of
late decoration of shafts."The Scuola di San Rocco is one of the most interesting examples of
Renaissance work in Venice.Its fluted pillars are surrounded each by a
wreath, one of vine, another of laurel, another of oak, not indeed
arranged with the fantasticism of early Gothic; but, especially the
laurel, reminding one strongly of the laurel sprays, powerful as well as
beautiful, of Veronese and Tintoret.Their stems are curiously and
richly interlaced--the last vestige of the Byzantine wreathed work--and
the vine-leaves are ribbed on the surfaces, I think, nearly as finely as
those of the Noah,[106] though more injured by time.The capitals are
far the richest Renaissance in Venice, less corrupt and more masculine
in plan, than any other, and truly suggestive of support, though of
course showing the tendency to error in this respect; and finally, at
the angles of the pure Attic bases, on the square plinth, are set
couchant animals; one, an elephant four inches high, very curiously and
cleverly cut, and all these details worked with a spirit, finish, fancy,
and affection quite worthy of the middle ages.But they have all the
marked fault of being utterly detached from the architecture.The
wreaths round the columns look as if they would drop off the next
moment, and the animals at the bases produce exactly the effect of mice
who had got there by accident: one feels them ridiculously diminutive,
and utterly useless."The effect of diminutiveness is, I think, chiefly owing to there being
no other groups of figures near them, to accustom the eye to the
proportion, and to the needless choice of the largest animals,
elephants, bears, and lions, to occupy a position so completely
insignificant, and to be expressed on so contemptible a scale,--not in a
bas-relief or pictorial piece of sculpture, but as independent figures.The whole building is a most curious illustration of the appointed fate
of the Renaissance architects,--to caricature whatever they imitated,
and misapply whatever they learned.ROMANIST DECORATION OF BASES.I have spoken above (Appendix 12) of the way in which the Roman Catholic
priests everywhere suffer their churches to be desecrated.But the worst
instances I ever saw of sacrilege and brutality, daily permitted in the
face of all men, were the uses to which the noble base of St.Mark's was
put, when I was last in Venice.Portions of nearly all cathedrals may be
found abandoned to neglect; but this base of St.Full fronting the western sun--crossing the whole breadth of
St.Mark's Place--the termination of the most noble square in the
world--the centre of the most noble city--its purple marbles were, in
the winter of 1849, the customary _gambling tables_ of the idle children
of Venice; and the parts which flank the Great Entrance, that very
entrance where "Barbarossa flung his mantle off," were the counters of a
common bazaar for children's toys, carts, dolls, and small pewter spoons
and dishes, German caricatures and books of the Opera, mixed with those
of the offices of religion; the caricatures being fastened with twine
round the porphyry shafts of the church.One Sunday, the 24th of
February, 1850, the book-stall being somewhat more richly laid out than
usual, I noted down the titles of a few of the books in the order in
which they lay, and I give them below.The irony conveyed by the
juxtaposition of the three in Italics appears too shrewd to be
accidental; but the fact was actually so.Along the edge of the white plinth were a row of two kinds of books,

  Officium Beatae Virg.M.; and Officium Hebdomadae sanctae, juxta Formam
    Missalis et Breviarii Romani sub Urbano VIII.Behind these lay, side by side, the following:

  Don Desiderio.Dramma Giocoso per Musica.Breve Esposizione della Carattere di vera Religione.On the top of this latter, keeping its leaves open,

  La Figlia del Reggimento._Carteggio di Madama la Marchesa di Pompadour, ossia
     raccolta di Lettere scritte della Medesima._
  _Istruzioni di morale Condotta per le Figlie._
  _Francesca di Rimini.Dramma per Musica._

Then, a little farther on, after a mass of plays:--

  Orazioni a Gesu Nazareno e a Maria addolorata.Semiramide; Melodramma tragico da rappresentarsi nel Gran Teatro
    il Fenice.Modo di orare per l'Acquisto del S. Giubileo, conceduto a tutto il
    Mondo Cattolico da S. S. Gregorio XVI.Le due illustre Rivali, Melodramma in Tre Atti, da rappresentarsi
    nel nuovo Gran Teatro il Fenice.Il Cristiano secondo il Cuore di Gesu, per la Pratica delle sue
    Virtu.Traduzione dell'Idioma Italiana.La chiava Chinese; Commedia del Sig.La Pelarina; Intermezzo de Tre Parti per Musica.Il Cavaliero e la Dama; Commedia in Tre Atti in Prosa.But this being the last piece of
Appendix I have to add to the present volume, I would desire to close
its pages with a question to my readers--a statistical question, which,
I doubt not, is being accurately determined for us all elsewhere, and
which, therefore, it seems to me, our time would not be wasted in
determining for ourselves.There has now been peace between England and the continental powers
about thirty-five years, and during that period the English have visited
the continent at the rate of many thousands a year, staying there, I
suppose, on the average, each two or three months; nor these an inferior
kind of English, but the kind which ought to be the best--the noblest
born, the best taught, the richest in time and money, having more
leisure, knowledge, and power than any other portion of the nation.These, we might suppose, beholding, as they travelled, the condition of
the states in which the Papal religion is professed, and being, at the
same time, the most enlightened section of a great Protestant nation,
would have been animated with some desire to dissipate the Romanist
errors, and to communicate to others the better knowledge which they
possessed themselves.I doubt not but that He who gave peace upon the
earth, and gave it by the hand of England, expected this much of her,
and has watched every one of the millions of her travellers as they
crossed the sea, and kept count for him of his travelling expenses, and
of their distribution, in a manner of which neither the traveller nor
his courier were at all informed.I doubt not, I say, but that such
accounts have been literally kept for all of us, and that a day will
come when they will be made clearly legible to us, and when we shall see
added together, on one side of the account book, a great sum, the
certain portion, whatever it may be, of this thirty-five years'
spendings of the rich English, accounted for in this manner:--

To wooden spoons, nut-crackers, and jewellery, bought at Geneva, and
elsewhere among the Alps, so much; to shell cameos and bits of mosaic
bought at Rome, so much; to coral horns and lava brooches bought at
Naples, so much; to glass beads at Venice, and gold filigree at Genoa,
so much; to pictures, and statues, and ornaments, everywhere, so much;
to avant-couriers and extra post-horses, for show and magnificence, so
much; to great entertainments and good places for seeing sights, so
much; to ball-dresses and general vanities, so much.This, I say, will
be the sum on one side of the book; and on the other will be written:

To the struggling Protestant Churches of France, Switzerland, and
Piedmont, so much.Had we not better do this piece of statistics for ourselves, in time?FOOTNOTES:

  [93] Ed.[95] L'Artiste en Batiments, par Louis Berteaux: Dijon, 1848.My
    printer writes at the side of the page a note, which I insert with
    thanks:--"This is not the first attempt at a French order.The
    writer has a Treatise by Sebastian Le Clerc, a great man in his
    generation, which contains a Roman order, a Spanish order, which the
    inventor appears to think very grand, and a _new_ French order
    nationalised by the Gallic cock crowing and clapping its wings in
    the capital."[96] The lower group in Plate XVII.[97] One of the upper stories is also in Gally Knight's plate
    represented as merely banded, and otherwise plain: it is, in
    reality, covered with as delicate inlaying as the rest.The whole
    front is besides out of proportion, and out of perspective, at once;
    and yet this work is referred to as of authority, by our architects.Well may our architecture fall from its place among the fine arts,
    as it is doing rapidly; nearly all our works of value being devoted
    to the Greek architecture, which is _utterly useless_ to us--or
    worse._One_ most noble book, however, has been dedicated to our
    English abbeys,--Mr.E. Sharpe's "Architectural Parallels"--almost a
    model of what I should like to see done for the Gothic of all
    Europe.[98] Except in the single passage "tell it unto the Church," which
    is simply the _extension_ of what had been commanded before, i.e.,
    tell the fault first "between thee and him," then taking "with thee
    one or two more," then, to all Christian men capable of hearing the
    cause: if he refuse to hear their common voice, "let him be unto
    thee as a heathen man and publican:" (But consider how Christ
    treated both.)[99] One or two remarks on this subject, some of which I had
    intended to have inserted here, and others in Appendix 5, I have
    arranged in more consistent order, and published in a separate
    pamphlet, "Notes on the Construction of Sheep-folds," for the
    convenience of readers interested in other architecture than that of
    Venetian palaces.[100] Not, however, by Johnson's _testimony_: Vide Adventurer, No."Such operations as required neither celerity nor strength,--the
    low drudgery of collating copies, comparing authorities, _digesting
    dictionaries_, or accumulating compilations."[101] We have done so--theoretically; just as one would reason on
    the human form from the bones outwards: but the Architect of human
    form frames all at once--bone and flesh.[102] Of course mere multiplicability, as of an engraving, does not
    diminish the intrinsic value of the work; and if the casts of
    sculpture could be as sharp as the sculpture itself, they would hold
    to it the relation of value which engravings hold to paintings.And,
    if we choose to have our churches all alike, we might cast them all
    in bronze--we might actually coin churches, and have mints of
    Cathedrals.It would be worthy of the spirit of the century to put
    milled edges for mouldings, and have a popular currency of religious
    subjects: a new cast of nativities every Christmas.I have not heard
    this contemplated, however, and I speak, therefore, only of the
    results which I believe are contemplated, as attainable by mere
    mechanical applications of glass and iron.[103] I shall often have occasion to write measures in the current
    text, therefore the reader will kindly understand that whenever they
    are thus written, 2,, 2, with double commas between, the first
    figures stand for English feet, the second for English inches.[104] I cannot suffer this volume to close without also thanking my
    kind friend, Mr.Rawdon Brown, for help given me in a thousand ways
    during my stay in Venice: but chiefly for his direction to passages
    elucidatory of my subject in the MSS.[105] I have not seen the building itself, but Mr.Owen Jones's work
    may, I suppose, be considered as sufficiently representing it for
    all purposes of criticism.[106] The sculpture of the Drunkenness of Noah on the Ducal Palace,
    of which we shall have much to say hereafter.*       *       *       *       *

 Propose the ransom of my captive father.think, Attilia, who that Consul is,
 Manlius, thy father's rival, and his foe:
 His ancient rival, and his foe profess'd:
 To hope in him, my fair, were fond delusion._At._ Yet though his rival, Manlius is a _Roman_:
 Nor will he think of private enmities,
 Weigh'd in the balance with the good of Rome:
 Let me at least make trial of his honour._Lic._ Be it so, my fair!but elsewhere make thy suit;
 Let not the Consul meet Attilia _here_,
 Confounded with the refuse of the people._At._ Yes, I will see him _here_, e'en _here_, Licinius.Let _Manlius_ blush, not _me_: _here_ will I speak,
 _Here_ shall he answer me._Lic._                        Behold he comes._Lic._                  O bless me with a look,
 One parting look at least._At._                     Know, my Licinius,
 That at this moment I am all the _daughter_,
 The filial feelings now possess my soul,
 And other passions find no entrance there._Lic._ O sweet, yet powerful influence of virtue,
 That charms though cruel, though unkind subdues,
 And what was love exalts to admiration!Yes, 'tis the privilege of souls like thine
 To conquer most when least they aim at conquest.vouchsafe to think upon Licinius,
 Nor fear to rob thy father of his due;
 For surely virtue and the gods approve
 Unwearied constancy and spotless love.Manlius, stay, a moment stay, and hear me._Man._ I did not think to meet thee here, Attilia;
 The place so little worthy of the guest._At._ It would, indeed, have ill become Attilia,
 While still her father was a Roman citizen;
 But for the daughter of a slave to Carthage,
 It surely is most fitting._Man._                   Say, Attilia,
 What is the purpose of thy coming hither!_At._ What is the purpose, patience, pitying heaven!Tell me, how long, to Rome's eternal shame,
 To fill with horror all the wond'ring world,
 My father still must groan in Punic chains,
 And waste the tedious hours in cruel bondage?Days follow days, and years to years succeed,
 And Rome forgets her hero, is content
 That Regulus be a forgotten slave.is it that he preferr'd
 His country's profit to his children's good?Is it th' unshaken firmness of his soul,
 Just, uncorrupt, and, boasting, let me speak it,
 Poor in the highest dignities of Rome?_Man._ But know, Attilia----

 _At._                     O have patience with me.And can ungrateful _Rome_ so soon forget?Can those who breathe the air _he_ breath'd forget
 The great, the godlike virtues of my father?There's not a part of Rome but speaks his praise.The _streets_--through them the _hero_ pass'd triumphant:
 The _Forum_--there the _Legislator_ plann'd
 The wisest, purest laws:--_the Senate House_--
 There spoke the _patriot Roman_--there his voice
 Secur'd the public safety: Manlius, yes;
 The wisdom of his councils match'd his valour.Enter the _Temples_--mount the _Capitol_--
 And tell me, Manlius, to what hand but _his_
 They owe their trophies, and their ornaments.Their foreign banners, and their boasted ensigns,
 Tarentine, Punic, and Sicilian spoils?Nay, e'en those lictors who precede thy steps,
 This Consul's purple which invests thy limbs,
 All, all were Regulus's, were my father's.And yet this hero, this exalted patriot,
 This man of virtue, this immortal Roman,
 In base requital for his services,
 Is left to linger out a life in chains,
 No honours paid him but a daughter's tears._Man._ Just are thy tears:--thy father well deserves them;
 But know thy censure is unjust, Attilia.The fate of Regulus is felt by all:
 We know and mourn the cruel woes he suffers
 From barbarous Carthage._At._                      Manlius, you mistake;
 Alas!it is not Carthage which is barbarous;
 'Tis Rome, ungrateful Rome, is the barbarian;
 Carthage but punishes a foe profess'd,
 But Rome betrays her hero and her father:
 Carthage remembers how he slew her sons,
 But Rome forgets the blood he shed for _her_:
 Carthage revenges an acknowledged foe,
 But Rome, with basest perfidy, rewards
 The glorious hand that bound her brow with laurels.Which now is the barbarian, Rome or Carthage?_At._                   A woman shall inform you.Convene the senate; let them strait propose
 A ransom, or exchange for Regulus,
 To Africa's ambassador.Do this,
 And heaven's best blessings crown your days with peace._Man._ Thou speakest like a _daughter_, I, Attilia,
 Must as a _Consul_ act; I must consult
 The good of Rome, and with her good, her glory.Would it not tarnish her unspotted fame,
 To sue to Carthage on the terms thou wishest?rather own thou'rt still my father's foe.no fault of mine concurr'd
 To his destruction.ere this the senate is assembled----

 He's here, our father----Regulus is come!_At._ I thank you, gods: O my full heart!Hasten, my brother, lead, O lead me to him._Pub._ It is too soon: restrain thy fond impatience.With Africa's ambassador he waits,
 Until th' assembled senate give him audience._At._ Where was he Publius when thou saw'st him first?_Pub._ You know, in quality of Roman quaestor,
 My duty 'tis to find a fit abode
 For all ambassadors of foreign states.Hearing the Carthaginian was arriv'd,
 I hasten'd to the port, when, O just gods!No foreigner, no foe, no African

 And ease my anxious breast._Pub._                         Ere I arriv'd,
 My father stood already on the shore,
 Fixing his eyes with anxious eagerness,
 As straining to descry the Capitol.I saw, and flew with transport to embrace him,
 Pronounc'd with wildest joy the name of father--
 With reverence seiz'd his venerable hand,
 And would have kiss'd it; when the awful hero,
 With that stern grandeur which made Carthage tremble,
 Drew back--stood all collected in himself,
 And said austerely, Know, thou rash young man,
 That _slaves_ in _Rome_ have not the rights of _fathers_.Then ask'd, if yet the senate was assembled,
 And where?which having heard, without indulging
 The fond effusions of his soul, or mine,
 He suddenly retir'd.I flew with speed
 To find the Consul, but as yet success
 Attends not my pursuit._Barce._ Publius, you'll find him in Bellona's temple._At._ Then Regulus returns to Rome a slave!_Pub._ Yes, but be comforted; I know he brings
 Proposals for a peace; his will's his fate._At._ Rome may, perhaps, refuse to treat of peace._Pub._ Didst thou behold the universal joy
 At his return, thou wouldst not doubt success.There's not a tongue in Rome but, wild with transport,
 Proclaims aloud that Regulus is come;
 The streets are filled with thronging multitudes,
 Pressing with eager gaze to catch a look.The happy man who can descry him first,
 Points him to his next neighbour, he to his;
 Then what a thunder of applause goes round;
 What music to the ear of filial love!not a Roman eye was seen,
 But shed pure tears of exquisite delight.Judge of my feelings by thy own, my sister.By the large measure of thy fond affection,
 Judge mine.find him out;
 My joy is incomplete till he partakes it.When doubts and fears have rent my anxious heart,
 In all my woes he kindly bore a part:
 Felt all my sorrows with a soul sincere,
 Sigh'd as I sigh'd, and number'd tear for tear:
 Now favouring heav'n my ardent vows has blest,
 He shall divide the transports of my breast._Barce._               Publius, a moment hear me.Know'st thou the name of Africa's ambassador?_Barce._           Son of Hanno?_Pub._                            Yes!Hamilcar!--How shall I support it![_Aside._

 _Pub._ Ah, charming maid!the blood forsakes thy cheek:
 Is he the rival of thy Publius?speak,
 And tell me all the rigour of my fate._Barce._ Hear me, my Lord.Since I have been thy slave,
 Thy goodness, and the friendship of Attilia,
 Have soften'd all the horrors of my fate.Till now I have not felt the weight of bondage.Till now--ah, Publius!--think me not ungrateful,
 I would not wrong thee--I will be sincere--
 I will expose the weakness of my soul.Know then, my Lord--how shall I tell thee all?_Pub._ Stop, cruel maid, nor wound thy Publius more;
 I dread the fatal frankness of thy words:
 Spare me the pain of knowing I am scorn'd;
 And if thy heart's devoted to another,
 Yet do not tell it me; in tender pity
 Do not, my fair, dissolve the fond illusion,
 The dear delightful visions I have form'd
 Of future joy, and fond exhaustless love._Barce._ (_alone._)
 And shall I see him then, see my Hamilcar,
 Pride of my soul, and lord of all my wishes?The only man in all our burning Afric
 Who ever taught my bosom how to love!If at his name I feel these strange emotions,
 How shall I see, how meet my conqueror?O let not those presume to judge of joy
 Who ne'er have felt the pangs which absence gives.Such tender transport those alone can prove,
 Who long, like me, have known disastrous love;
 The tears that fell, the sighs that once were paid,
 Like grateful incense on his altar laid;
 The lambent flame rekindle, not destroy,
 And woes remember'd heighten present joy.SCENE--_The inside of the Temple of Bellona--Seats for the
 Senators and Ambassadors--Lictors guarding the entrance._

 MANLIUS, PUBLIUS, _and Senators_._Man._ Let Regulus be sent for to our presence;
 And with him the ambassador of Carthage.Is it then true the foe would treat of peace?_Pub._ They wish, at least, our captives were exchang'd,
 And send my father to declare their wish:
 If he obtain it, well: if not, then Regulus
 Returns to meet the vengeance of the foe,
 And pay for your refusal with his blood:
 He ratified this treaty with his oath,
 And ere he quitted Carthage, heard, unmov'd,
 The dreadful preparations for his death,
 Should he return.Say, can you give up Regulus to Carthage?_Man._ Peace, Publius, peace, for see thy father comes._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ REGULUS.I thought these walls had been well known to Regulus?I was thinking what I was
 When last I saw them, and what now I am._Ham._ (_to the Consul._)
 Carthage by me to Rome this greeting sends,
 That wearied out at length with bloody war,
 If Rome inclines to peace she offers it._Man._ We will at leisure answer thee.Come, Regulus, resume thine ancient place._Reg._ (_pointing to the Senators._) Who then are these?_Man._                            The Senators of Rome._Man._         What meanst thou?I'm her Consul;
 Hast thou so soon forgotten Manlius?_Reg._ And shall a _slave_ then have a place in Rome
 Among her Consuls and her Senators?_Man._ Yes!--For her _heroes_ Rome forgets her _laws_;
 Softens their harsh austerity for thee,
 To whom she owes her conquests and her triumphs._Reg._ Rome may forget, but Regulus remembers._Man._ Was ever man so obstinately good?[_Aside._

 _Pub._ (_rising._) Fathers![_To the Senators._

 _Reg._ Publius, what dost thou mean?_Pub._                             To do my duty:
 Where Regulus must stand, shall Publius sit?O Rome, how are thy manners chang'd!When last I left thee, ere I sail'd for Afric,
 It was a crime to think of private duties
 When public cares requir'd attention.----Sit,
 (_To_ PUBLIUS.)_Pub._ Forgive me, sir, if I refuse obedience:
 My heart o'erflows with duty to my father._Reg._ Know, Publius, that duty's at an end;
 Thy father died when he became a slave._Man._ Now urge thy suit, Hamilcar, we attend._Ham._ Afric hath chosen Regulus her messenger.In him, both Carthage and Hamilcar speak._Man._ (_to_ REGULUS.)_Ham._ (_to_ REGULUS.)Ere thou speak'st,
 Maturely weigh what thou hast sworn to do,
 Should Rome refuse to treat with us of peace._Reg._ What I have sworn I will fulfil, Hamilcar._Pub._       Ye guardian gods of Rome,
 With your own eloquence inspire him now!_Reg._ Carthage by me this embassy has sent:
 If Rome will leave her undisturb'd possession
 Of all she now enjoys, she offers _peace_;
 But if you rather wish protracted war,
 Her next proposal is, _exchange of captives_;----
 If you demand advice of _Regulus_,
 Reject them both!_Ham._              What dost thou mean?_Pub._                                    My father!I will not idly spend my breath,
 To show the dire effects of such a peace;
 The foes who beg it, show their dread of war._Man._ But the exchange of prisoners thou proposest?_Reg._ That artful scheme conceals some Punic fraud.hast thou so soon forgotten;

 _Reg._ I will fulfil the treaty I have sworn to._Reg._             Conscript Fathers!hear me.----
 Though this exchange teems with a thousand ills,
 Yet 'tis th' example I would deprecate.This treaty fix'd, Rome's honour is no more.Should her degenerate sons be promis'd life,
 Dishonest life, and worthless liberty,
 Her glory, valour, military pride,
 Her fame, her fortitude, her all were lost.What honest captive of them all would wish
 With shame to enter her imperial gates,
 The flagrant scourge of slavery on his back?None, none, my friends, would wish a fate so vile,
 But those base cowards who resign'd their arms
 Unstain'd with hostile blood, and poorly sued,
 Through ignominious fear of death, for bondage;
 The scorn, the laughter, of th' insulting foe._Man._ However hurtful this _exchange_ may be,
 The liberty, the life of Regulus,
 More than compensates for it._Reg._                   Thou art mistaken.----
 This Regulus is a mere mortal man,
 Yielding apace to all th' infirmities
 Of weak, decaying nature.----I am old,
 Nor can my future, feeble services
 Assist my country much; but mark me well:
 The young fierce heroes you'd restore to Carthage,
 In lieu of this old man, are her chief bulwarks.in vig'rous youth this well-strung arm
 Fought for my country, fought and conquer'd for her:
 That was the time to prize its service high.Now, weak and nerveless, let the foe possess it,
 For it can harm them in the field no more.Let Carthage have the poor degrading triumph
 To close these failing eyes;--but, O my countrymen!Check their vain hopes, and show aspiring Afric
 That heroes are the common growth of Rome._Man._ Unequall'd fortitude._Pub._                    O fatal virtue!_Man._ (_to the Senators._)
 Let honour be the spring of all our actions,
 Not interest, Fathers.Let no selfish views
 Preach safety at the price of truth and justice._Reg._ If Rome would thank me, I will teach her how.--Know, Fathers, that these savage Africans
 Thought me so base, so very low of soul,
 That the poor wretched privilege of breathing,
 Would force me to betray my country to them.Have these barbarians any tortures left
 To match the cruelty of such a thought?Arm, arm yourselves, prepare your citizens,
 Snatch your imprison'd eagles from their fanes,
 Fly to the shores of Carthage, force her gates,
 Dye every Roman sword in Punic blood--
 And do such deeds--that when I shall return,
 (As I have _sworn_, and am resolv'd to do,)
 I may behold with joy, reflected back,
 The terrors of your rage in the dire visages
 Of my astonish'd executioners._Ham._ Surprise has chill'd my blood!_Man._ Romans, we must defer th' important question;
 Maturest councils must determine on it.Rest we awhile:----Nature requires some pause
 From high-rais'd admiration.Thou, Hamilcar,
 Shalt shortly know our final resolution.Meantime, we go to supplicate the gods._Man._ Yes, Regulus, I think the danger less
 To lose th' advantage thy advice suggests,
 Than would accrue to Rome in losing thee,
 Whose wisdom might direct, whose valour guard her.Athirst for glory, thou wouldst rush on death,
 And for thy country's sake wouldst greatly perish.Too vast a sacrifice thy zeal requires,
 For Rome must bleed when Regulus expires.[_Exeunt Consul and Senators._

 _Manent_ REGULUS, PUBLIUS, HAMILCAR; _to them
 enter_ ATTILIA _and_ LICINIUS._Ham._ Does Regulus fulfil his promise thus?_Reg._ I've promis'd to return, and I will do it._Lic._                              Ah!and At._ O by this hand we beg----

 _Reg._                             Away!Thanks to Rome's guardian gods I'm yet a slave!And will be still a slave to make Rome free!_At._ Was the exchange refus'd?conduct Hamilcar and myself
 To that abode thou hast for each provided.And will my father spurn his household gods?_Pub._ My sire a stranger?----Will he taste no more
 The smiling blessings of his cheerful home?_Reg._ Dost thou not know the laws of Rome forbid
 A foe's ambassador within her gates?_Pub._ This rigid law does not extend to thee._Reg._ Yes; did it not alike extend to all,
 'Twere tyranny.--The law rights every man,
 But favours none._At._                Then, O my father,
 Allow thy daughter to partake thy fate!The present exigence
 Demands far other thoughts, than the soft cares,
 The fond effusions, the delightful weakness,
 The dear affections 'twixt the child and parent._At._ How is my father chang'd, from what I've known him!_Reg._ The fate of Regulus is chang'd, not Regulus.I am the same; in laurels or in chains
 'Tis the same principle; the same fix'd soul,
 Unmov'd itself, though circumstances change.The native vigour of the free-born mind
 Still struggles with, still conquers adverse fortune;
 Soars above chains, invincible though vanquish'd.[_Exeunt_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS.ATTILIA, HAMILCAR _going; enter_ BARCE._Ham._                     Ah!my long-lost Barce:
 Again I lose thee; Regulus rejects
 Th' exchange of prisoners Africa proposes.My heart's too full.--Oh, I have much to say!_Barce._ Yet you unkindly leave me, and say nothing.didst thou love as thy Hamilcar loves,
 Words were superfluous; in my eyes, my Barce,
 Thou'dst read the tender eloquence of love,
 Th' uncounterfeited language of my heart.A single look betrays the soul's soft feelings,
 And shows imperfect speech of little worth._At._ My father then conspires his own destruction,
 Is it not so?_Barce._       Indeed I fear it much;
 But as the senate has not yet resolv'd,
 There is some room for hope: lose not a moment;
 And, ere the Conscript Fathers are assembled,
 Try all the powers of winning eloquence,
 Each gentle art of feminine persuasion,
 The love of kindred, and the faith of friends,
 To bend the rigid Romans to thy purpose._At._ Yes, Barce, I will go; I will exert
 My little pow'r, though hopeless of success.fall'n from hope's gay heights
 Down the dread precipice of deep despair.So some tir'd mariner the coast espies,
 And his lov'd home explores with straining eyes;
 Prepares with joy to quit the treacherous deep,
 Hush'd every wave, and every wind asleep;
 But ere he lands upon the well-known shore,
 Wild storms arise, and furious billows roar,
 Tear the fond wretch from all his hopes away,
 And drive his shatter'd bark again to sea.SCENE--_A Portico of a Palace without the gates of
 Rome--The abode of the Carthaginian Ambassador_._Enter_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS _meeting_.Publius here at such a time as this?Know'st thou th' important question that the Senate
 This very hour debate?--Thy country's glory,
 Thy father's honour, and the public good?Dost thou know this and fondly linger here?_Pub._ They're not yet met, my father._Reg._                            Haste--away--
 Support my counsel in th' assembled Senate,
 Confirm their wav'ring virtue by thy courage,
 And Regulus shall glory in his boy.spare thy son the most ungrateful task.What!--supplicate the ruin of my father?_Reg._ The good of Rome can never hurt her sons._Pub._ In pity to thy children, spare thyself._Reg._ Dost thou then think that mine's a frantic bravery?That Regulus would rashly seek his fate?how little dost thou know thy sire!learn, that like _other_ men,
 I shun the _evil_, and I seek the _good_;
 But _that_ I find in _guilt_, and _this_ in _virtue_.Were it not guilt, guilt of the blackest die,
 Even to _think_ of freedom at th' expense
 Of my dear bleeding country?To me, therefore,
 Freedom and life would be the heaviest evils;
 But to preserve that country, to restore her,
 To heal her wounds though at the price of _life_,
 Or what is dearer far, the price of liberty,
 Is _virtue_--therefore slavery and death
 Are Regulus's good--his wish--his choice._Pub._ Yet sure our country----

 _Reg._                        Is a _whole_, my Publius,
 Of which we all are _parts_; nor should a citizen
 Regard his interests as distinct from hers;
 No hopes or fears should touch his patriot soul,
 But what affect her honour or her shame.E'en when in hostile fields he bleeds to save her,
 'Tis not _his_ blood he loses, 'tis his _country's_;
 He only pays her back a debt he owes.To her he's bound for birth and education:
 Her laws secure him from domestic feuds,
 And from the foreign foe her arms protect him.She lends him honours, dignity, and rank,
 His wrongs revenges, and his merit pays;
 And like a tender and indulgent mother,
 Loads him with comforts, and would make his state
 As blest as nature and the gods design'd it.Such gifts, my son, have their alloy of _pain_;
 And let th' unworthy wretch who will not bear
 His portion of the public burden lose
 Th' advantages it yields;--let him retire
 From the dear blessings of a social life,
 And from the sacred laws which guard those blessings;
 Renounce the civilis'd abodes of man,
 With kindred brutes one common shelter seek
 In horrid wilds, and dens, and dreary caves,
 And with their shaggy tenants share the spoil;
 Or if the savage hunters miss their prey,
 From scatter'd acorns pick a scanty meal;--
 Far from the sweet civilities of life;
 There let him live and vaunt his wretched freedom:
 While we, obedient to the laws that guard us,
 Guard _them_, and live or die as they decree._Pub._ With reverence and astonishment I hear thee!Thy words, my father, have convinc'd my reason,
 But cannot touch my heart:--nature denies
 Obedience so repugnant._Reg._ A poor excuse, unworthy of a Roman!Brutus, Virginius, Manlius--they were fathers._Pub._ 'Tis true, they were; but this heroic greatness,
 This glorious elevation of the soul,
 Has been confin'd to fathers.--Rome, till now,
 Boasts not a son of such unnatural virtue,
 Who, spurning all the powerful ties of blood,
 Has labour'd to procure his father's death._Reg._ Then be the first to give the great example--
 Go, hasten; be thyself that son, my Publius.ah!--

 _Reg._               Publius, no more; begone--
 Attend the Senate--let me know my fate;
 'Twill be more glorious if announc'd by thee._Pub._ Too much, too much thy rigid virtue claims
 From thy unhappy son.In either case an obvious duty waits thee:
 If thou regard'st me as an alien here,
 Learn to prefer to mine the good of Rome;
 If as a father--reverence my commands.couldst thou look into my inmost soul,
 And see how warm it burns with love and duty,
 Thou would'st abate the rigour of thy words._Reg._ Could I explore the secrets of thy breast,
 The virtue I would wish should flourish there
 Were fortitude, not weak, complaining love._Pub._ If thou requir'st my _blood_, I'll shed it all;
 But when thou dost enjoin the harsher task
 That I should labour to procure thy death,
 Forgive thy son--he has not so much virtue._Reg._ Th' important hour draws on, and now my soul
 Loses her wonted calmness, lest the Senate
 Should doubt what answer to return to Carthage.look down propitious on her,
 Inspire her Senate with your sacred wisdom,
 And call up all that's Roman in their souls!_Enter_ MANLIUS (_speaking_).See that the lictors wait, and guard the entrance--
 Take care that none intrude._Reg._                         Ah!_Man._                     Where, where is Regulus?The great, the godlike, the invincible?Oh, let me strain the hero to my breast.--

 _Reg._ (_avoiding him._)
 Manlius, stand off, remember I'm a slave!_Man._                    I am something more:
 I am a man enamour'd of thy virtues;
 Thy fortitude and courage have subdued me.I _was_ thy _rival_--I am _now_ thy _friend_;
 Allow me that distinction, dearer far
 Than all the honours Rome can give without it._Reg._ This is the temper still of noble minds,
 And these the blessings of an humble fortune.Had I not been a _slave_, I ne'er had gain'd
 The treasure of thy friendship._Man._                           I confess,
 Thy grandeur cast a veil before my eyes,
 Which thy reverse of fortune has remov'd.Oft have I seen thee on the day of triumph,
 A conqueror of nations, enter Rome;
 Now, thou hast conquer'd fortune, and thyself.Thy laurels oft have mov'd my soul to envy,
 Thy chains awaken my respect, my reverence;
 Then Regulus appear'd a hero to me,
 He rises now a god._Reg._                    Manlius, enough.Cease thy applause; 'tis dang'rous; praise like thine
 Might tempt the most severe and cautious virtue.Bless'd be the gods, who gild my latter days
 With the bright glory of the Consul's friendship!_Man._ Forbid it, Jove!said'st thou thy _latter_ days?May gracious heav'n to a far distant hour
 Protract thy valued life!Be it _my_ care
 To crown the hopes of thy admiring country,
 By giving back her long-lost hero to her.I will exert my power to bring about
 Th' exchange of captives Africa proposes._Reg._ Manlius, and is it thus, is this the way
 Thou dost begin to give me proofs of friendship?if thy love be so destructive to me,
 What would thy hatred be?Shall I then lose the profit of my wrongs?Be thus defrauded of the benefit
 I vainly hop'd from all my years of bondage?I did not come to show my chains to Rome,
 To move my country to a weak compassion;
 I came to save her _honour_, to preserve her
 From tarnishing her glory; came to snatch her
 From offers so destructive to her fame.either give me proofs more worthy
 A Roman's friendship, or renew thy hate._Man._ Dost thou not know, that this exchange refus'd,
 Inevitable death must be thy fate?_Reg._ And has the name of _death_ such terror in it,
 To strike with dread the mighty soul of Manlius?'Tis not _to-day_ I learn that I am mortal.The foe can only take from Regulus
 What wearied nature would have shortly yielded;
 It will be now a voluntary gift,
 'Twould then become a tribute seiz'd, not offer'd.Yes, Manlius, tell the world that as I liv'd
 For Rome alone, when I could live no longer,
 'Twas my last care how, dying, to assist,
 To save that country I had liv'd to serve.Hast thou then sworn, thou awfully good man,
 Never to bless the Consul with thy friendship?_Reg._ If thou wilt love me, love me like a _Roman_.These are the terms on which I take thy friendship.We both must make a sacrifice to Rome,
 I of my life, and thou of _Regulus_:
 One must resign his being, one his friend.It is but just, that what procures our country
 Such real blessings, such substantial good,
 Should cost thee something--I shall lose but little.but promise, ere thou goest,
 With all the Consular authority,
 Thou wilt support my counsel in the Senate.If thou art willing to accept these terms,
 With transport I embrace thy proffer'd friendship._Man._ (_after a pause._) Yes, I do promise._Reg._                 Bounteous gods, I thank you!Ye never gave, in all your round of blessing,
 A gift so greatly welcome to my soul,
 As Manlius' friendship on the terms of honour!_Reg._ My friend, there's not a moment to be lost;
 Ere this, perhaps, the Senate is assembled.To thee, and to thy virtues, I commit
 The dignity of Rome--my peace and honour._Reg._                       Farewell, my friend!_Man._ The sacred flame thou hast kindled in my soul
 Glows in each vein, trembles in every nerve,
 And raises me to something more than man.My blood is fir'd with virtue, and with Rome,
 And every pulse beats an alarm to glory.Who would not spurn a sceptre when compar'd
 With chains like thine?Thou man of every virtus,
 O, farewell!_Reg._ Now I begin to live; propitious heaven
 Inclines to favour me.----Licinius here?_Lic._ With joy, my honour'd friend, I seek thy presence._Lic._                   Because my heart once more
 Beats high with flattering hope.In thy great cause
 I have been labouring._Reg._                 Say'st thou in _my_ cause?_Lic._ In thine and Rome's.Couldst thou, then, think so poorly of Licinius,
 That base ingratitude could find a place
 Within his bosom?--Can I, then, forget
 Thy thousand acts of friendship to my youth?Forget them, too, at that important moment
 When most I might assist thee?--Regulus,
 Thou wast my leader, general, father--all.Didst thou not teach me early how to tread
 The path of glory; point the way thyself,
 And bid me follow thee?_Reg._                    But say, Licinius,
 What hast thou done to serve me?_Lic._                             I have defended
 Thy liberty and life!_Reg._                 Ah!speak--explain.--

 _Lic._ Just as the Fathers were about to meet,
 I hasten'd to the temple--at the entrance
 Their passage I retarded by the force
 Of strong entreaty: then address'd myself
 So well to each, that I from each obtain'd
 A declaration, that his utmost power
 Should be exerted for thy life and freedom._Lic._ Not he alone; no, 'twere indeed unjust
 To rob the fair Attilia of her claim
 To filial merit.--What I could, I did.But _she_--thy charming daughter--heav'n and earth,
 What did she not to save her father?_Reg._                                  Who?_Lic._ Attilia, thy belov'd--thy age's darling!Was ever father bless'd with such a child?how her looks took captive all who saw her!How did her soothing eloquence subdue
 The stoutest hearts of Rome!How did she rouse
 Contending passions in the breasts of all!With what a soft, inimitable grace
 She prais'd, reproach'd, entreated, flatter'd, sooth'd._Lic._                        What could they say?See where she comes--Hope dances in her eyes,
 And lights up all her beauties into smiles._At._ Once more, my dearest father----

 _Reg._                         Ah, presume not
 To call me by that name.For know, Attilia,
 I number _thee_ among the foes of Regulus._Reg._ His worst of foes--the murd'rer of his glory.is it then a proof of enmity
 To wish thee all the good the gods can give thee,
 To yield my life, if needful, for thy service?_Reg._ Thou rash, imprudent girl!thou little know'st
 The dignity and weight of public cares.Who made a weak and inexperienc'd _woman_
 The arbiter of Regulus's fate?_Lic._ For pity's sake, my Lord!_Reg._                      Peace, peace, young man!_That_ bears at least the semblance of repentance.Immortal Powers!----a daughter and a Roman!_At._ Because I _am_ a daughter, I presum'd----

 _Lic._ Because I _am_ a Roman, I aspired
 T' oppose th' inhuman rigour of thy fate._Reg._ No more, Licinius.How can he be call'd
 A Roman who would live in infamy?Or how can she be Regulus's daughter
 Whose coward mind wants fortitude and honour?now you make me _feel_
 The burden of my chains: your feeble souls
 Have made me know I am indeed a slave._At._ Tell me, Licinius, and, oh!tell me truly,
 If thou believ'st, in all the round of time,
 There ever breath'd a maid so truly wretched?To weep, to mourn a father's cruel fate--
 To love him with soul-rending tenderness--
 To know no peace by day or rest by night--
 To bear a bleeding heart in this poor bosom,
 Which aches, and trembles but to think he suffers:
 This is my crime--in any other child
 'Twould be a merit._Lic._                Oh!my best Attilia,
 Do not repent thee of the pious deed:
 It was a virtuous error._That_ in _us_
 Is a just duty, which the god-like soul
 Of Regulus would think a shameful weakness.If the contempt of life in him be virtue,
 It were in us a crime to let him perish.Perhaps at last he may consent to live:
 He then will thank us for our cares to save him:
 Let not his anger fright thee.Though our love
 Offend him now, yet, when his mighty soul
 Is reconcil'd to life, he will not chide us.The sick man loathes, and with reluctance takes
 The remedy by which his health's restor'd._Lic._ Would my Attilia rather lose her father
 Than, by offending him, preserve his life?If he but live, I am contented._Lic._ Yes, he shall live, and we again be bless'd;
 Then dry thy tears, and let those lovely orbs
 Beam with their wonted lustre on Licinius,
 Who lives but in the sunshine of thy smiles.O Fortune, Fortune, thou capricious goddess!Thy frowns and favours have alike no bounds:
 Unjust, or prodigal in each extreme.When thou wouldst humble human vanity,
 By singling out a wretch to bear thy wrath,
 Thou crushest him with anguish to excess:
 If thou wouldst bless, thou mak'st the happiness
 Too poignant for his giddy sense to bear.----
 Immortal gods, who rule the fates of men,
 Preserve my father!bless him, bless him, heav'n!If your avenging thunderbolts _must_ fall,
 Strike _here_--this bosom will invite the blow,
 And _thank_ you for it: but in mercy spare,
 Oh!spare _his_ sacred, venerable head:
 Respect in _him_ an image of yourselves;
 And leave a world, who wants it, an example
 Of courage, wisdom, constancy and truth.Yet if, Eternal Powers who rule this ball!You have decreed that Regulus must fall;
 Teach me to yield to your divine command,
 And meekly bow to your correcting hand;
 Contented to resign, or pleas'd receive,
 What wisdom may withhold, or mercy give.SCENE--_A Gallery in the Ambassador's Palace._


 _Reg._ (_alone._)
 Be calm, my soul!Thou hast defied the dangers of the deep,
 Th' impetuous hurricane, the thunder's roar,
 And all the terrors of the various war;
 Yet, now thou tremblest, now thou stand'st dismay'd,
 With fearful expectation of thy fate.----
 Yes--thou hast amplest reason for thy fears;
 For till this hour, so pregnant with events,
 Thy fame and glory never were at stake.Soft--let me think--what is this thing call'd _glory_?'Tis the soul's tyrant, that should be dethron'd,
 And learn subjection like her other passions!'tis false: this is the coward's plea;
 The lazy language of refining vice.That man was born in vain, whose wish to serve
 Is circumscrib'd within the wretched bounds
 Of _self_--a narrow, miserable sphere!Glory exalts, enlarges, dignifies,
 Absorbs the selfish in the social claims,
 And renders man a blessing to mankind.--
 It is this principle, this spark of deity,
 Rescues debas'd humanity from guilt,
 And elevates it by her strong excitements:--
 It takes off sensibility from pain,
 From peril fear, plucks out the sting from death,
 Changes ferocious into gentle manners,
 And teaches men to imitate the gods.he advances with a down-cast eye,
 And step irresolute----

    _Enter_ PUBLIUS._Reg._                My Publius, welcome!quickly tell me.--

 _Pub._ I cannot speak, and yet, alas!_Reg._ Tell me the whole.--

 _Pub._                Would I were rather dumb!_Reg._ Publius, no more delay:--I charge thee speak._Pub._ The Senate has decreed thou shalt depart.thou hast at last prevail'd--
 I thank the gods, I have not liv'd in vain!Where is Hamilcar?--find him--let us go,
 For Regulus has nought to do in Rome;
 I have accomplished her important work,
 And must depart._Pub._            Ah, my unhappy father!_Reg._ Unhappy, Publius!Does he, does that bless'd man deserve this name,
 Who to his latest breath can serve his country?_Pub._ Like thee, my father, I adore my country,
 Yet weep with anguish o'er thy cruel chains._Reg._ Dost thou not know that _life_'s a slavery?The body is the chain that binds the soul;
 A yoke that every mortal must endure.Wouldst thou lament--lament the general fate,
 The chain that nature gives, entail'd on all,
 Not these _I_ wear?_Pub._              Forgive, forgive my sorrows:
 I know, alas!too well, those fell barbarians
 Intend thee instant death._Reg._                   So shall my life
 And servitude together have an end.----
 Publius, farewell; nay, do not follow me.--

 _Pub._ Alas!my father, if thou ever lov'dst me,
 Refuse me not the mournful consolation
 To pay the last sad offices of duty
 I e'er can show thee.----

 _Reg._                  No!--thou canst fulfil
 Thy duty to thy father in a way
 More grateful to him: I must strait embark.Be it meanwhile thy pious care to keep
 My lov'd Attilia from a sight, I fear,
 Would rend her gentle heart.--Her tears, my son,
 Would dim the glories of thy father's triumph.And should her sorrows pass the bounds of reason,
 Publius, have pity on her tender age,
 Compassionate the weakness of her sex;
 We must not hope to find in _her_ soft soul
 The strong exertion of a manly courage.----
 Support her fainting spirit, and instruct her,
 By thy example, how a Roman ought
 To bear misfortune.And be to her the father she will lose.I leave my daughter to thee--I do more----
 I leave to thee the conduct of--thyself.I perceive thy courage fails--
 I see the quivering lip, the starting tear:--
 That lip, that tear calls down my mounting soul.Resume thyself--Oh, do not blast my hope!Yes--I'm compos'd--thou wilt not mock my age--
 Thou _art_--thou art a _Roman_--and my son._Pub._ And is he gone?--now be thyself, my soul--
 Hard is the conflict, but the triumph glorious.Yes.--I must conquer these too tender feelings;
 The blood that fills these veins demands it of me;
 My father's great example too requires it.Forgive me _Rome_, and _glory_, if I yielded
 To nature's strong attack:--I must subdue it.Now, Regulus, I _feel_ I am thy _son_._Enter_ ATTILIA _and_ BARCE._At._ My brother, I'm distracted, wild with fear--
 Tell me, O tell me, what I dread to know--
 Is it then true?--I cannot speak--my father?_Barce._ May we believe the fatal news?_Pub._                                Yes, Barce,
 It is determin'd._At._ Immortal Powers!--What say'st thou?_Barce._                               Can it be?_At._                  Then you've all betray'd me._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS._Barce._                         Pity us, Hamilcar!_At._ Oh, help, Licinius, help the lost Attilia!_Lic._                     Ah!my fair mourner,
 All's lost._At._          What all, Licinius?Tell me, at least, where Regulus is gone:
 The daughter shall partake the father's chains,
 And share the woes she knew not to prevent.[_Going._

 _Pub._ What would thy wild despair?Attilia, stay,
 Thou must not follow; this excess of grief
 Would much offend him._At._                    Dost thou hope to stop me?_Pub._ I hope thou wilt resume thy better self,
 And recollect thy father will not bear----

 _At._ I only recollect I am a _daughter_,
 A poor, defenceless, helpless, wretched daughter!_Pub._                         No, my sister._At._ Detain me not--Ah!while thou hold'st me here,
 He goes, and I shall never see him more._Barce._ My friend, be comforted, he cannot go
 Whilst here Hamilcar stays._At._                          O Barce, Barce!Who will advise, who comfort, who assist me?Hamilcar, pity me.--Thou wilt not answer?_Ham._ Rage and astonishment divide my soul._At._ Licinius, wilt thou not relieve my sorrows?_Lic._ Yes, at my life's expense, my heart's best treasure,
 Wouldst thou instruct me how._At._                         My brother, too----
 Ah!_Pub._ I will at least instruct thee how to _bear_ them.My sister--yield thee to thy adverse fate;
 Think of thy father, think of Regulus;
 Has he not taught thee how to brave misfortune?'Tis but by following his illustrious steps
 Thou e'er canst merit to be call'd his daughter._At._ And is it thus thou dost advise thy sister?Are these, ye gods, the feelings of a son?Indifference here becomes impiety--
 Thy savage heart ne'er felt the dear delights
 Of filial tenderness--the thousand joys
 That flow from blessing and from being bless'd!No--didst thou love thy father as _I_ love him,
 Our kindred souls would be in unison;
 And all my sighs be echoed back by thine.Thou wouldst--alas!--I know not what I say.--
 Forgive me, Publius,--but indeed, my brother,
 I do not understand this cruel coldness._Ham._ Thou may'st not--but I understand it well.His mighty soul, full as to thee it seems
 Of Rome, and glory--is enamour'd--caught--
 Enraptur'd with the beauties of fair Barce.--
 _She_ stays behind if Regulus _departs_.Behold the cause of all the well-feign'd virtue
 Of this mock patriot--curst dissimulation!_Pub._ And canst thou entertain such vile suspicions?now I see thee as thou art,
 Thy naked soul divested of its veil,
 Its specious colouring, its dissembled virtues:
 Thou hast plotted with the Senate to prevent
 Th' exchange of captives.All thy subtle arts,
 Thy smooth inventions, have been set to work--
 The base refinements of your _polish'd_ land._Pub._ In truth the doubt is worthy of an African.[_Contemptuously._

 _Ham._ I know.----

 _Pub._ Peace, Carthaginian, peace, and hear me,
 Dost thou not know, that on the very man
 Thou hast insulted, Barce's fate depends?_Ham._ Too well I know, the cruel chance of war
 Gave her, a blooming captive, to thy mother;
 Who, dying, left the beauteous prize to thee._Pub._ Now, see the use a _Roman_ makes of power.Heav'n is my witness how I lov'd the maid!Oh, she was dearer to my soul than light!Dear as the vital stream that feeds my heart!But know my _honour_'s dearer than my love.I do not even hope _thou_ wilt believe me;
 _Thy_ brutal soul, as savage as thy clime,
 Can never taste those elegant delights,
 Those pure refinements, love and glory yield.'Tis not to thee I stoop for vindication,
 Alike to me thy friendship or thy hate;
 But to remove from others a pretence
 For branding Publius with the name of villain;
 That _they_ may see no sentiment but honour
 Informs this bosom--Barce, thou art _free_.Thou hast my leave with him to quit this shore.Now learn, barbarian, how a _Roman_ loves![_Exit._

 _Barce._ He cannot mean it!_Ham._                         Oh, exalted virtue!cruel Publius, wilt thou leave me thus?_Barce._                Didst thou hear, Hamilcar?Oh, didst thou hear the god-like youth resign me?[HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS _seem lost in thought_._Ham._ Farewell, I will return._Barce._ Hamilcar, where----

 _At._                 Alas!_Lic._ If possible, to save the life of Regulus._At._ But by what means?--Ah!_Lic._ Since the disease so desperate is become,
 We must apply a desperate remedy._Ham._ (_after a long pause._)
 Yes--I will mortify this generous foe;
 I'll be reveng'd upon this stubborn Roman;
 Not by defiance bold, or feats of arms,
 But by a means more sure to work its end;
 By emulating his exalted worth,
 And showing him a virtue like his own;
 Such a refin'd revenge as noble minds
 Alone can practise, and alone can feel._At._ If thou wilt go, Licinius, let Attilia
 At least go with thee._Lic._                 No, my gentle love,
 Too much I prize thy safety and thy peace.Let me entreat thee, stay with Barce here
 Till our return._At._              Then, ere ye go, in pity
 Explain the latent purpose of your souls._Lic._ Soon shalt thou know it all--Farewell!Let us keep Regulus in _Rome_, or _die_.[_To_ HAMILCAR _as he goes out_._Ham._ Yes.--These smooth, polish'd Romans shall confess
 The soil of _Afric_, too, produces heroes.What, though our pride, perhaps, be less than theirs,
 Our virtue may be equal: they shall own
 The path of honour's not unknown to Carthage,
 Nor, as they arrogantly think, confin'd
 To their proud Capitol:----Yes--they shall learn
 The gods look down on other climes than theirs.[_Exit._

 _At._ What gone, _both_ gone?Licinius leaves me, led by love and virtue,
 To rouse the citizens to war and tumult,
 Which may be fatal to himself and Rome,
 And yet, alas!_Barce._ Nor is thy Barce more at ease, my friend;
 I dread the fierceness of Hamilcar's courage:
 Rous'd by the grandeur of thy brother's deed,
 And stung by his reproaches, his great soul
 Will scorn to be outdone by him in glory.Yet, let us rise to courage and to life,
 Forget the weakness of our helpless sex,
 And mount above these coward woman's fears.Hope dawns upon my mind--my prospect clears,
 And every cloud now brightens into day.Thy sanguine temper,
 Flush'd with the native vigour of thy soil,
 Supports thy spirits; while the sad Attilia,
 Sinking with more than all her sex's fears,
 Sees not a beam of hope; or, if she sees it,
 'Tis not the bright, warm splendour of the sun;
 It is a sickly and uncertain glimmer
 Of instantaneous lightning passing by.It shows, but not diminishes, the danger,
 And leaves my poor benighted soul as dark
 As it had never shone._Barce._                 Come, let us go.Yes, joys unlook'd-for now shall gild thy days,
 And brighter suns reflect propitious rays.[_Exeunt._


 SCENE--_A Hall looking towards the Garden._

 _Enter_ REGULUS, _speaking to one of_ HAMILCAR'S _Attendants_.Ere this he doubtless knows the Senate's will.Go, seek him out--Tell him we must depart----
 Rome has no hope for him, or wish for me.O let me strain thee to this grateful heart,
 And thank thee for the vast, vast debt I owe thee!But for _thy_ friendship I had been a wretch----
 Had been compell'd to shameful _liberty_.To thee I owe the glory of these chains,
 My faith inviolate, my fame preserv'd,
 My honour, virtue, glory, bondage,--all!_Man._ But we shall lose thee, so it is decreed----
 Thou must depart?_Reg._                Because I must depart
 You will not lose me; I were lost, indeed,
 Did I remain in Rome._Man._                   Ah!Regulus,
 Why, why so late do I begin to love thee?why have the adverse fates decreed
 I ne'er must give thee other proofs of friendship,
 Than those so fatal and so full of woe?_Reg._ Thou hast perform'd the duties of a friend;
 Of a just, faithful, Roman, noble friend:
 Yet, generous as thou art, if thou constrain me
 To sink beneath a weight of obligation,
 I could--yes, Manlius--I could ask still more._Reg._                   I think I have fulfill'd
 The various duties of a citizen;
 Nor have I aught beside to do for Rome.Manlius, I recollect I am a father!my friend,
 They are--(forgive the weakness of a parent)
 To my fond heart dear as the drops that warm it.Next to my country they're my all of life;
 And, if a weak old man be not deceiv'd,
 They will not shame that country.Yes, my friend,
 The love of virtue blazes in their souls.As yet these tender plants are immature,
 And ask the fostering hand of cultivation:
 Heav'n, in its wisdom, would not let their _father_
 Accomplish this great work.--To thee, my friend,
 The tender parent delegates the trust:
 Do not refuse a poor man's legacy;
 I do bequeath my orphans to thy love--
 If thou wilt kindly take them to thy bosom,
 Their loss will be repaid with usury.Oh, let the father owe his glory to thee,
 The children their protection!_Man._                           Regulus,
 With grateful joy my heart accepts the trust:
 Oh, I will shield, with jealous tenderness,
 The precious blossoms from a blasting world.In me thy children shall possess a father,
 Though not as worthy, yet as fond as thee.The pride be mine to fill their youthful breasts
 With ev'ry virtue--'twill not cost me much:
 I shall have nought to teach, nor they to learn,
 But the great history of their god-like sire._Reg._ I will not hurt the grandeur of thy virtue,
 By paying thee so poor a thing as thanks.Now all is over, and I bless the gods,
 I've nothing more to do._Enter_ PUBLIUS _in haste_._Pub._                    O Regulus!_Pub._                       Rome is in a tumult--
 There's scarce a citizen but runs to arms--
 They will not let thee go._Reg._                     Is't possible?Can Rome so far forget her dignity
 As to desire this infamous exchange?_Pub._               Ah!Rome cares not for the peace, nor for th' exchange;
 She only wills that Regulus shall stay._Pub._              No: every man exclaims
 That neither faith nor honour should be kept
 With Carthaginian perfidy and fraud.Can guilt in Carthage palliate guilt in Rome,
 Or vice in one absolve it in another?who hereafter shall be criminal,
 If precedents are us'd to justify
 The blackest crimes._Pub._                 Th' infatuated people
 Have called the augurs to the sacred fane,
 There to determine this momentous point._Reg._ I have no need of _oracles_, my son;
 _Honour's_ the oracle of honest men.I gave my promise, which I will observe
 With most religious strictness.Rome, 'tis true,
 Had power to choose the peace, or change of slaves;
 But whether Regulus return, or not,
 Is _his_ concern, not the concern of _Rome_._That_ was a public, _this_ a private care.thy father is not what he was;
 _I_ am the slave of _Carthage_, nor has Rome
 Power to dispose of captives not her own.let us to the port.--Farewell, my friend._Man._ Let me entreat thee stay; for shouldst thou go
 To stem this tumult of the populace,
 They will by force detain thee: then, alas!Both Regulus and Rome must break their faith._Man._                                No, Regulus,
 I will not check thy great career of glory:
 Thou shalt depart; meanwhile, I'll try to calm
 This wild tumultuous uproar of the people._Reg._ Thy virtue is my safeguard----but----

 _Man._                                Enough----
 _I_ know _thy_ honour, and trust thou to _mine_.I am a _Roman_, and I feel some sparks
 Of Regulus's virtue in my breast.Though fate denies me thy illustrious chains,
 I will at least endeavour to _deserve_ them.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ How is my country alter'd!how, alas,
 Is the great spirit of old Rome extinct!_Restraint_ and _force_ must now be put to use
 To _make_ her virtuous.She must be _compell'd_
 To faith and honour.--Ah!And dost thou leave so tamely to my friend
 The honour to assist me?Go, my boy,
 'Twill make me _more_ in love with chains and death,
 To owe them to a _son_._Pub._                    I go, my father--
 I will, I will obey thee._Reg._                    Do not sigh----
 One sigh will check the progress of thy glory._Pub._ Yes, I will own the pangs of death itself
 Would be less cruel than these agonies:
 Yet do not frown austerely on thy son:
 His anguish is his virtue: if to conquer
 The feelings of my soul were easy to me,
 'Twould be no merit.Do not then defraud
 The sacrifice I make thee of its worth.[_Exeunt severally._


    MANLIUS, ATTILIA._At._ (_speaking as she enters._)
 Where is the Consul?--Where, oh, where is Manlius?I come to breathe the voice of mourning to him,
 I come to crave his mercy, to conjure him
 To whisper peace to my afflicted bosom,
 And heal the anguish of a wounded spirit._Man._ What would the daughter of my noble friend?_At._ (_kneeling._)
 If ever pity's sweet emotions touch'd thee,--
 If ever gentle love assail'd thy breast,--
 If ever virtuous friendship fir'd thy soul--
 By the dear names of husband and of parent--
 By all the soft, yet powerful ties of nature--
 If e'er thy lisping infants charm'd thine ear,
 And waken'd all the father in thy soul,--
 If e'er thou hop'st to have thy latter days
 Blest by their love, and sweeten'd by their duty--
 Oh, hear a kneeling, weeping, wretched daughter,
 Who begs a father's life!--nor hers alone,
 But Rome's--his country's father._Man._                                Gentle maid!Oh, spare this soft, subduing eloquence!--
 Nay, rise.I shall forget I am a Roman--
 Forget the mighty debt I owe my country--
 Forget the fame and glory of thy father.[_Turns from her._

 _At._ (_rises eagerly._)            Ah!Indulge, indulge, my Lord, the virtuous softness:
 Was ever sight so graceful, so becoming,
 As pity's tear upon the hero's cheek?_Man._ No more--I must not hear thee.[_Going._

 _At._                    How!You must--you shall--nay, nay return, my Lord--
 Oh, fly not from me!----look upon my woes,
 And imitate the mercy of the gods:
 'Tis not their thunder that excites our reverence,
 'Tis their mild mercy, and forgiving love.'Twill add a brighter lustre to thy laurels,
 When men shall say, and proudly point thee out,
 "Behold the Consul!--He who sav'd his friend."Oh, what a tide of joy will overwhelm thee!_Man._ Thy father scorns his liberty and life,
 Nor will accept of either at the expense
 Of honour, virtue, glory, faith, and Rome._At._ Think you behold the god-like Regulus
 The prey of unrelenting savage foes,
 Ingenious only in contriving ill:----
 Eager to glut their hunger of revenge,
 They'll plot such new, such dire, unheard-of tortures--
 Such dreadful, and such complicated vengeance,
 As e'en the Punic annals have not known;
 And, as they heap fresh torments on his head,
 They'll glory in their genius for destruction.Manlius--now methinks I see my father--
 My faithful fancy, full of his idea,
 Presents him to me--mangled, gash'd, and torn--
 Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony--
 The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh,
 While the dire murderers smile upon his wounds,
 His groans their music, and his pangs their sport.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!_Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--

 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _Reg._ Is a most painful virtue;--but Attilia
 Is Regulus's daughter, and must have it._At._ I will entreat the gods to give it me._Reg._ Is this concern a mark that thou hast lost it?I cannot, cannot spurn my weeping child.Receive this proof of my paternal fondness;--
 Thou lov'st Licinius--he too loves my daughter.I give thee to his wishes; I do more--
 I give thee to his virtues.--Yes, Attilia,
 The noble youth deserves this dearest pledge
 Thy father's friendship ever can bestow.wilt thou, canst thou leave me?_Reg._ I am, I am thy father!as a proof,
 I leave thee my example how to suffer.I have a heart within this bosom;
 That heart has passions--see in what we differ;
 Passion--which is thy tyrant--is my slave.Ah!--

 _Reg._                       Farewell![_Exit._

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,
 Thy mighty spirit struggling in this breast,
 And it shall conquer all these coward feelings,
 It shall subdue the woman in my soul;
 A Roman virgin should be something more--
 Should dare above her sex's narrow limits--
 And I will dare--and mis'ry shall assist me--
 My father!The hero shall no more disdain his child;
 Attilia shall not be the only branch
 That yields dishonour to the parent tree.is it true that Regulus,
 In spite of senate, people, augurs, friends,
 And children, will depart?_At._                       Yes, it is true._At._                                You forget--
 Barce!_Barce._ Dost thou approve a virtue which must lead
 To chains, to tortures, and to certain death?those chains, those tortures, and that death,
 Will be his triumph._Barce._                Thou art pleas'd, Attilia:
 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".A knowledge of Sterne existed among the more
intelligent lovers of English literature in Germany, the leaders of
thought, whose voice compelled attention for the understandable, but was
powerless to create appreciation for the unintelligible among the lower
ranks of readers.This knowledge and appreciation of Yorick were
immediately available for the furtherance of Sterne’s fame as soon as a
work of popular appeal was published.The then prevailing interest in
travels is, further, not to be overlooked as a forceful factor in
securing immediate recognition for the Sentimental Journey.[2] At no
time in the world’s history has the popular interest in books of travel,
containing geographical and topographical description, and information
concerning peoples and customs, been greater than during this period.The presses teemed with stories of wanderers in known and unknown lands.The preface to the _Neue Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen_ of Leipzig for
the year 1759 heralds as a matter of importance a gain in geographical
description.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen_, 1773, makes
in its tables of contents, a separate division of travels.In 1759,
also, the “Allgemeine Historie der Reisen zu Wasser und zu Lande”
(Leipzig, 1747-1774), reached its seventeenth volume.These are brief
indications among numerous similar instances of the then predominant
interest in the wanderer’s experience.Sterne’s second work of fiction,
though differing in its nature so materially from other books of travel,
may well, even if only from the allurement of its title, have shared the
general enthusiasm for the traveler’s narrative.Most important,
however, is the direct appeal of the book itself, irresistible to the
German mind and heart.Germany had been for a decade hesitating on the
verge of tears, and grasped with eagerness a book which seemed to give
her British sanction for indulgence in her lachrymose desire.The portion of Shandy which is virtually a part of the Sentimental
Journey,[3] which Sterne, possibly to satisfy the demands of the
publisher, thrust in to fill out volumes contracted for, was not long
enough, nor distinctive enough in its use of sentiment, was too
effectually concealed in its volume of Shandean quibbles, to win readers
for the whole of Shandy, or to direct wavering attention through the
mazes of Shandyism up to the point where the sentimental Yorick really
takes up the pen and introduces the reader to the sad fate of Maria of
Moulines.One can imagine eager Germany aroused to sentimental frenzy
over the Maria incident in the Sentimental Journey, turning with
throbbing contrition to the forgotten, neglected, or unknown passage in
Tristram Shandy.[4]

It is difficult to trace sources for Sterne in English letters, that is,
for the strange combination of whimsicality, genuine sentiment and
knavish smiles, which is the real Sterne.He is individual, exotic, not
demonstrable from preceding literary conditions, and his meteoric, or
rather rocket-like career in Britain is in its decline a proof of the
insensibility of the English people to a large portion of his gospel.The creature of fancy which, by a process of elimination, the Germans
made out of Yorick is more easily explicable from existing and preceding
literary and emotional conditions in Germany.[5] Brockes had prepared
the way for a sentimental view of nature, Klopstock’s poetry had
fostered the display of emotion, the analysis of human feeling.Gellert
had spread his own sort of religious and ethical sentimentalism among
the multitudes of his devotees.Stirred by, and contemporaneous with
Gallic feeling, Germany was turning with longing toward the natural man,
that is, man unhampered by convention and free to follow the dictates of
the primal emotions.The exercise of human sympathy was a goal of this
movement.In this vague, uncertain awakening, this dangerous freeing of
human feelings, Yorick’s practical illustration of the sentimental life
could not but prove an incentive, an organizer, a relief for pent-up
emotion.[6]

Johann Joachim Christoph Bode has already been mentioned in relation to
the early review of Zückert’s translation of Shandy.His connection with
the rapid growth of the Yorick cult after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey demands a more extended account of this German
apostle of Yorick.In the sixth volume of Bode’s translation of
Montaigne[7] was printed first the life of the translator by C. A.
Böttiger.This was published the following year by the same house in a
separate volume entitled “J. J.C. Bodes literarisches Leben, nebst
dessen Bildnis von Lips.” All other sources of information regarding
Bode, such as the accounts in Jördens and in Schlichtegroll’s
“Nekrolog,”[8] are derivations or abstracts from this biography.Bode
was born in Braunschweig in 1730; reared in lowly circumstances and
suffering various vicissitudes of fortune, he came to Hamburg in 1756-7.Gifted with a talent for languages, which he had cultivated assiduously,
he was regarded at the time of his arrival, even in Hamburg, as one
especially conversant with the English language and literature.His
nature must have borne something akin to Yorick, for his biographer
describes his position in Hamburg society as not dissimilar to that once
occupied for a brief space in the London world by the clever fêted
Sterne.Yet the enthusiasm of the friend as biographer doubtless colors
the case, forcing a parallel with Yorick by sheer necessity.Before 1768
Bode had published several translations from the English with rather
dubious success, and the adaptability of the Sentimental Journey to
German uses must have occurred to him, or have been suggested to him
directly upon its very importation into Germany.He undoubtedly set
himself to the task of translation as soon as the book reached
his hands, for, in the issue of the _Hamburgische
Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ for April 20, is found Bode’s translation
of a section from the Sentimental Journey.“Die Bettler” he names the
extract; it is really the fifth of the sections which Sterne labels
“Montriul.”[9] In the numbers of the same paper for June 11 and 15, Bode
translates in two parts the story of the “Monk;” thus, in but little
over three months after its English publication, the story of the poor
Franciscan Lorenzo and his fateful snuff-box was transferred to Germany
and began its heart-touching career.These excerpts were included by
Bode later in the year when he published his translation of the whole
Sentimental Journey.The first extract was evidently received with favor
and interest, for, in the foreword to the translation of the “Monk,” in
the issue of June 11, Bode assigns this as his reason for making his
readers better acquainted with this worthy book.He further says that
the reader of taste and insight will not fail to distinguish the
difference when so fine a connoisseur of the human heart as Sterne
depicts sentiments, and when a shallow wit prattles of his emotions.Bode’s last words are a covert assumption of his rôle as prophet and
priest of Yorick in Germany: “The reader may himself judge from the
following passage, whether we have spoken of our Briton in terms of too
high praise.”

In the July number of the _Unterhaltungen_, another Hamburg periodical,
is printed another translation from the Sentimental Journey entitled:
“Eine Begebenheit aus Yoricks Reise fürs Herz übersetzt.” The episode is
that of the _fille de chambre_[10] who is seeking Crébillon’s “Les
Egarements du Coeur et de l’Esprit.” The translator omits the first part
of the section and introduces us to the story with a few unacknowledged
words of his own.In the September number of the same periodical the
rest of the _fille de chambre_ story[11] is narrated.Here also the
translator alters the beginning of the account to make it less abrupt in
the rendering.The author of this translation has not been determined.Bode does not translate the word “Sentimental” in his published
extracts, giving merely the English title; hence Lessing’s advice[12]
concerning the rendering of the word dates probably from the latter part
of the summer.The translation in the September number of the
_Unterhaltungen_ also does not contain a rendering of the word.Bode’s
complete translation was issued probably in October,[13] possibly late
in September, 1768, and bore the imprint of the publisher Cramer in
Hamburg and Bremen, but the volumes were printed at Bode’s own press and
were entitled “Yoricks Empfindsame Reise durch Frankreich und Italien,
aus dem Englischen übersetzt.”[14]

The translator’s preface occupies twenty pages and is an important
document in the story of Sterne’s popularity in Germany, since it
represents the introductory battle-cry of the Sterne cult, and
illustrates the attitude of cultured Germany toward the new star.Bode
begins his foreword with Lessing’s well-known statement of his devotion
to Sterne.Bode does not name Lessing; calls him “a well-known German
scholar.” The statement referred to was made when Bode brought to his
friend the news of Sterne’s death.It is worth repeating:

“I would gladly have resigned to him five years of my own life, if such
a thing were possible, though I had known with certainty that I had only
ten, or even eight left. . . .but under the condition that he must keep
on writing, no matter what, life and opinions, or sermons, or journeys.”
On July 5, 1768, Lessing wrote to Nicolai, commenting on Winckelmann’s
death as follows: “He is the second author within a short time, to whom
I would have gladly given some years of my own life.”[15]

Nearly thirty years later (March 20, 1797) Sara Wulf, whose maiden name
was Meyer and who was later and better known as Frau von Grotthus, wrote
from Dresden to Goethe of the consolation found in “Werther” after a
disappointing youthful love affair, and of Lessing’s conversation with
her then concerning Goethe.She reports Lessing’s words as follows: “You
will feel sometime what a genius Goethe is, I am sure of this.I have
always said I would give ten years of my own life if I had been able to
lengthen Sterne’s by one year, but Goethe consoles me in some measure
for his loss.”[16]

It would be absurd to attach any importance to this variation of
statement.It does not indicate necessarily an affection for Sterne and
a regret at his loss, mathematically doubled in these seven or eight
years between Sterne’s death and the time of Lessing’s conversation with
Sara Meyer; it probably arises from a failure of memory on the part of
the lady, for Bode’s narrative of the anecdote was printed but a few
months after Sterne’s death, and Lessing made no effort to correct an
inaccuracy of statement, if such were the case, though he lived to see
four editions of Bode’s translation and consequently so many repetitions
of his expressed but impossible desire.Erich Schmidt[17] reduces this
willingness on Lessing’s part to one year,--an unwarranted liberty.These two testimonies of Lessing’s devotion are of importance in
defining his attitude toward Yorick.They attest the fact that this was
no passing fancy, no impulsive thought uttered on the moment when the
news of Sterne’s death was brought to him, and when the Sentimental
Journey could have been but a few weeks in his hands, but a deep-seated
desire, born of reflection and continued admiration.[18] The addition of
the word “Reisen” in Bode’s narrative is significant, for it shows that
Lessing must have become acquainted with the Sentimental Journey before
April 6, the date of the notice of Sterne’s death in the _Hamburgische
Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_;[19] that is, almost immediately after its
English publication, unless Bode, in his enthusiasm for the book which
he was offering the public, inserted the word unwarrantably in Lessing’s
statement.To return to Bode’s preface.With emphatic protestations, disclaiming
vanity in appealing to the authority of so distinguished a friend, Bode
proceeds to relate more in detail Lessing’s connection with his
endeavor.He does not say that Lessing suggested the translation to him,
though his account has been interpreted to mean that, and this fact has
been generally accepted by the historians of literature and the
biographers of Lessing.[20] The tone of Bode’s preface, however, rather
implies the contrary, and no other proof of the supposition is
available.What Bode does assert is merely that the name of the scholar
whom he quotes as having expressed a willingness to give a part of his
own life if Sterne’s literary activity might be continued, would create
a favorable prepossession for his original (“ein günstiges Vorurtheil”),
and that a translator is often fortunate enough if his selection of a
book to translate is not censured.All this implies, on Lessing’s part,
only an approval of Bode’s choice, a fact which would naturally follow
from the remarkable statement of esteem in the preceding sentence.Bode
says further that out of friendship for him and regard for the reader of
taste, this author (Lessing), had taken the trouble to go through the
whole translation, and then he adds the conventional request in such
circumstances, that the errors remaining may be attributed to the
translator and not to the friend.The use of the epithet “empfindsam” for “sentimental” is then the
occasion for some discussion, and its source is one of the facts
involved in Sterne’s German vogue which seem to have fastened themselves
on the memory of literature.Bode had in the first place translated the
English term by “sittlich,” a manifestly insufficient if not flatly
incorrect rendering, but his friend coined the word “empfindsam” for the
occasion and Bode quotes Lessing’s own words on the subject:

“Bemerken Sie sodann dass sentimental ein neues Wort ist.War es Sternen
erlaubt, sich ein neues Wort zu bilden, so muss es eben darum auch
seinem Uebersetzer erlaubt seyn.Die Engländer hatten gar kein
Adjectivum von Sentiment: wir haben von Empfindung mehr als eines,
empfindlich, empfindbar, empfindungsreich, aber diese sagen alle etwas
anders.Wenn eine mühsame Reise eine Reise
heisst, bey der viel Mühe ist: so kann ja auch eine empfindsame Reise
eine Reise heissen, bey der viel Empfindung war.Ich will nicht sagen,
dass Sie die Analogie ganz auf ihrer Seite haben dürften.Aber was die
Leser vors erste bey dem Worte noch nicht denken mögen, sie sich nach
und nach dabey zu denken gewöhnen.”[21]

The statement that Sterne coined the word “sentimental” is undoubtedly
incorrect,[22] but no one seems to have discovered and corrected the
error till Nicolai’s article on Sterne in the _Berlinische
Monatsschrift_ for February, 1795, in which it is shown that the word
had been used in older English novels, in “Sir Charles Grandison”
indeed.[23] It may well be that, as Böttiger hints,[24] the coining of
the word “empfindsam” was suggested to Lessing by Abbt’s similar
formation of “empfindnisz.”[25]

  [Transcriber’s Note:
  The reference is to Böttinger, not to the present text.]The preface to this first edition of Bode’s translation of the
Sentimental Journey contains, further, a sketch of Sterne’s life,[26]
his character and his works.Bode relates the familiar story of the dog,
but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by “Geck” in Sterne’s
reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat episode is narrated, and
a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes in London with Tristram
Shandy and the sermons.Allusion has already been made to the hints
thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany.A translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick
serves as a portrait for Sterne.A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769.The preface,
which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical
with the first, but has some significant additions.A word is said
relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27]
Bode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert
and Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous
preface concerning the source of his aid.Bode admits that even this
disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the
_Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named
Lessing as the scholar referred to in the first introduction.The
addition and prominence of Ebert’s name is worthy of note, for in spite
of the plural mention[30] in the appendix to the introduction, his first
acknowledgment is to one friend only and there is no suggestion of
another counselor.Ebert’s connection with the Bode translation has been
overlooked in the distribution of influence, while the memorable coining
of the new word, supplemented by Böttiger’s unsubstantiated statements,
has emphasized Lessing’s service in this regard.Ebert is well-known as
an intelligent and appreciative student of English literature, and as a
translator, but his own works betray no trace of imitation or admiration
of Sterne.The final words of this new preface promise a translation of the
continuation of the Sentimental Journey; the spurious volumes of
Eugenius are, of course, the ones meant here.This introduction to the
second edition remains unchanged in the subsequent ones.The text of the
second edition was substantially an exact reproduction of the first,
but Bode allowed himself frequent minor changes of word or phrase, an
alteration occurring on an average once in about three pages.Bode’s
changes are in general the result of a polishing or filing process, in
the interest of elegance of discourse, or accuracy of translation.Bode
acknowledges that some of the corrections were those suggested by a
reviewer,[31] but states that other passages criticised were allowed to
stand as they were.He says further that he would have asked those
friends who had helped him on his translation itself to aid him in the
alterations, if distance and other conditions had allowed.The reference
here is naturally to his separation from Ebert, who was in Braunschweig,
but the other “conditions” which could prevent a continuation of
Lessing’s interest in the translation and his assistance in revision are
not evident.Lessing was in Hamburg during this period, and hence his
advice was available.Bode’s retranslation of the passage with which Sterne’s work closed
shows increased perception and appreciation for the subtleness of
Sterne’s indecent suggestions, or, perhaps, a growing lack of timidity
or scruple in boldly repeating them.It is probable that the
continuation by Eugenius, which had come into his hands during this
period, had, with its resumption of the point, reminded Bode of the
inadequacy and inexactness of his previous rendering.At almost precisely the same time that Bode’s translation appeared,
another German rendering was published, a fact which in itself is
significant for the determination of the relative strength of appeal as
between Sterne’s two works of fiction.The title[32] of this version was
“Versuch über die menschliche Natur in Herrn Yoricks, Verfasser des
Tristram Shandy, Reisen durch Frankreich und Italien, aus dem
Englischen.” It was dated 1769 and was published at the “Fürstliche
Waisenhausbuchhandlung,” in Braunschweig.The preface is signed
Braunschweig, September 7, 1768, and the book was issued in September or
October.The anonymous translator was Pastor Mittelstedt[33] in
Braunschweig (Hirsching und Jördens say Hofprediger), whom the partisan
Böttiger calls the ever-ready manufacturer of translations (der allezeit
fertige Uebersetzungsfabrikant).Behmer tentatively suggests Weis as the
translator of this early rendering, an error into which he is led
evidently by a remark in Bode’s preface in which the apologetic
translator states the rumor that Weis was engaged in translating the
same book, and that he (Bode) would surely have locked up his work in
his desk if the publisher had not thereby been led to suffer loss.This first edition of the Mittelstedt translation contains 248 pages and
is supplied with a preface which is, like Bode’s, concerned in
considerable measure with the perplexing problem of the translation of
Sterne’s title.The English title is given and the word “sentimental” is
declared a new one in England and untranslatable in German.Mittelstedt
proposes “Gefühlvolle Reisen,” “Reisen fürs Herz,” “Philosophische
Reisen,” and then condemns his own suggestions as indeterminate and
forced.He then goes on to say, “So I have chosen the title which Yorick
himself suggests in the first part.”[34] He speaks of the lavish praise
already bestowed on this book by the learned journals, and turns at last
aside to do the obvious: he bemoans Sterne’s death by quoting Hamlet and
closes with an apostrophe to Sterne translated from the April number of
the _Monthly Review_ for 1768.[35] In 1769, the year when the first
edition was dated, the Mittelstedt translation was published under a
slightly altered title, as already mentioned.This second edition of the
Mittelstedt translation in the same year as the first is overlooked by
Jördens and Hirsching,[36] both of whom give a second and hence really a
third edition in 1774.Böttiger notes with partisan zeal that Bode’s
translation was made use of in some of the alterations of this second
edition, and further records the fact that the account of Sterne’s life,
added in this edition, was actually copied from Bode’s preface.[37]

The publication of the Mittelstedt translation was the occasion of a
brief controversy between the two translators in contemporary journals.Mittelstedt printed his criticism of Bode’s work in a home paper, the
_Braunschweiger Intelligenzblätter_, and Bode spoke out his defense in
the _Neue Hamburger Zeitung_.That Bode in his second edition adopted
some of the reviewer’s suggestions and criticisms has been noted, but in
the preface to this edition he declines to resume the strife in spite of
general expectation of it, but, as a final shot, he delivers himself of
“an article from his critical creed,” that the “critic is as little
infallible as author or translator,” which seems, at any rate, a rather
pointless and insignificant contribution to the controversy.Bode’s translation of the third and fourth volumes of Yorick’s
Journey,[38] that is, the continuation by Eugenius, followed directly
after the announcement in the preface to the second edition of the first
two volumes, as already mentioned.Böttiger states that Bode had this
continuation from Alberti and knew it before anyone else in Germany.It
was published in England in the spring of 1769, and was greeted with a
disapproval which was quite general, and it never enjoyed there any
considerable genuine popularity or recognition.Bode published this
translation of Stevenson’s work without any further word of comment or
explanation whatsoever, a fact which easily paved the way for a
misunderstanding relative to the volumes, for Bode was frequently
regarded as their author and held responsible for their defects.Bode
himself never made any satisfactory or adequate explanation of his
attitude toward these volumes, and the reply to Goeze in the
introduction to his translation of Shandy is the nearest approach to a
discussion of his position.But there Bode is concerned only with the
attack made by the Hamburg pastor upon his character, an inference drawn
from the nature of the book translated, and the character of the
translation; in the absence of a new edition in which “Mine and His
shall be marked off by distinct boundaries,” he asks Goeze only to send
to him, and beg “for original and translation,” naturally for the
purpose of comparison.This evasive reply is Bode’s only defense or
explanation.Böttiger claims that the review of Bode’s translation in
the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ did much to spread the idea of
Bode’s authorship, though the reviewer in that periodical[39] only
suggests the possibility of German authorship, a suspicion aroused by
the substitution of German customs and motif and word-play, together
with contemporary literary allusion, allusion to literary mediocrities
and obscurities, of such a nature as to preclude the possibility of the
book’s being a literal translation from the English.The exact amount and the nature of Bode’s divergence from the original,
his alterations and additions, have never been definitely stated by
anyone.The reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ is
manifestly ignorant of the original.Böttiger is indefinite and
partisan, yet his statement of the facts has been generally accepted and
constantly repeated.He admits the German coloring given the translation
by Bode through German allusions and German word-plays: he says that
Bode allowed himself these liberties, feeling that he was no longer
dealing with Sterne, a statement of motive on Bode’s part which the
latter never makes and never hints at.The only absolute additions which
Böttiger mentions as made by Bode to the narrative of Eugenius are the
episode, “Das Hündchen,” and the digression, “Die Moral.” The erroneous
idea herein implied has been caught up and repeated by nearly everyone
who has mentioned Bode’s translation of the work.[40] The less certain
allusion to “Die Moral” has been lost sight of, and “Das Hündchen” alone
has been remembered as representing this activity on Bode’s part.In
fact this episode is only one of many pure creations on Bode’s part and
one of the briefer.In the first pages of these volumes Bode is faithful
to the original, a fact suggesting that examination or comparison of the
original text and Bode’s translation was never carried beyond the first
two-score pages; yet here, it would seem, Bode’s rendering was less
careful, more open to censure for inaccuracy, than in the previous
volumes.[41]

This method of translation obtains up to page 48, then Bode omits a
half-page of half-innocent, half-revolting suggestion, the story of the
Cordelier, and from the middle of page 49 to page 75, twenty-five pages,
the translator adds material absolutely his own.This fiction,
introducing Yorick’s sentimental attitude toward the snuff-box, resuming
a sentimental episode in Sterne’s work, full of tears and sympathy,
is especially characteristic of Yorick, as the Germans conceived him.The story is entitled “Das Mündel,”[42] “The Ward,” and is evidently
intended as a masculine companion-piece to the fateful story of Maria of
Moulines, linked to it even in the actual narrative itself.An
unfortunate, half-crazed man goes about in silence, performing little
services in an inn where Yorick finds lodging.He was once the brilliant son of the village miller, was
well-educated and gifted with scholarly interests and attainments.While
instructing some children at Moulines, he meets a peasant girl, and love
is born between them.An avaricious brother opposes Jacques’s passion
and ultimately confines him in secret, spreading the report in Moulines
of his faithlessness to his love.After a tragedy has released Jacques
from his unnatural bondage, he learns of his loved one’s death and loses
his mental balance through grief.Such an addition to the brief pathos
of Maria’s story, as narrated by Sterne, such a forced explanation of
the circumstances, is peculiarly commonplace and inartistic.Sterne
instinctively closed the episode with sufficient allowance for the
exercise of the imagination.Following this addition, the section “Slander” of the original is
omitted.The story of the adventure with the opera-girl is much changed.The bald indecency of the narrative is somewhat softened by minor
substitutions and omissions.Nearly two pages are inserted here, in
which Yorick discourses on the difference between a sentimental traveler
and an _avanturier_.On pages 122-126, the famous “Hündchen” episode is
narrated, an insertion taking the place of the hopelessly vulgar “Rue
Tireboudin.” According to this narrative, Yorick, after the fire, enters
a home where he finds a boy weeping over a dead dog and refusing to be
comforted with promises of other canine possessions.The critics united
in praising this as being a positive addition to the Yorick adventures,
as conceived and related in Sterne’s finest manner.After the lapse of
more than a century, one can acknowledge the pathos, the humanity of the
incident, but the manner is not that of Sterne.It is a simple,
straight-forward relation of the touching incident, introducing that
element of the sentimental movement which bears in Germany a close
relation to Yorick, and was exploited, perhaps, more than any other
feature of his creed, as then interpreted, _i.e._, the sentimental
regard for the lower animals.[43] But there is lacking here the
inevitable concomitant of Sterne’s relation of a sentimental situation,
the whimsicality of the narrator in his attitude at the time of the
adventure, or reflective whimsicality in the narration.Sterne is always
whimsically quizzical in his conduct toward a sentimental condition, or
toward himself in the analysis of his conduct.After the “Vergebene Nachforschung” (Unsuccessful Inquiry), which agrees
with the original, Bode adds two pages covering the touching solicitude
of La Fleur for his master’s safety.This addition is, like the
“Hündchen” episode, just mentioned, of considerable significance, for it
illustrates another aspect of Sterne’s sentimental attitude toward human
relations, which appealed to the Germany of these decades and was
extensively copied; the connection between master and man.Following
this added incident, Bode omits completely three sections of Eugenius’s
original narrative, “The Definition,” “Translation of a Fragment” and
“An Anecdote;” all three are brief and at the same time of baldest, most
revolting indecency.In all, Bode’s direct additions amount in this
first volume to about thirty-three pages out of one hundred and
forty-two.The divergences from the original are in the second volume
(the fourth as numbered from Sterne’s genuine Journey) more marked and
extensive: above fifty pages are entirely Bode’s own, and the individual
alterations in word, phrase, allusion and sentiment are more numerous
and unwarranted.The more significant of Bode’s additions are here
noted.“Die Moral” (pages 32-37) contains a fling at Collier, the author
of a mediocre English translation of Klopstock’s “Messias,” and another
against Kölbele, a contemporary German novelist, whose productions have
long since been forgotten.[44]

Eugenius’s chapter, “Vendredi-Saint,” Bode sees fit to alter in a rather
extraordinary way, by changing the personnel and giving it quite another
introduction.He inserts here a brief account of Walter Shandy, his
disappointment at Tristram’s calamitous nose and Tristram’s name, and
his resolve to perfect his son’s education; and then he makes the visit
to M’lle Laborde, as narrated by Eugenius, an episode out of Walter
Shandy’s book, which was written for Tristram’s instruction, and,
according to Bode, was delivered for safe-keeping into Yorick’s hands.Bode changes M’lle Laborde into M’lle Gillet, and Walter Shandy is her
visitor, not Yorick.Bode allows himself some verbal changes and softens
the bald suggestion at the end.Bode’s motive for this startling change
is not clear beyond question.The most plausible theory is that the open
and gross suggestion of immoral relation between Yorick, the clergyman
and moralist, and the Paris maiden, seemed to Bode inconsistent with the
then current acceptation of Yorick’s character; and hence he preferred
by artifice to foist the misdemeanor on to the elder Shandy.The second extensive addition of Bode’s in this volume is the section
called “Die Erklärung,” and its continuation in the two following
divisions, a story which unites itself with the “Fragment” in Sterne’s
original narration.Yorick is ill and herbs are brought to him in paper
wrappings which turn out to contain the story of the decayed gentleman,
which, according to Sterne’s relation, the Notary was beginning to
write.It will be remembered that the introduction in Sterne was also
brought by La Fleur as a bit of wrapping paper.This curious
coincidence, this prosaic resumption of the broken narrative, is naïve
at least, but can hardly commend itself to any critic as being other
than commonplace and bathetic.The story itself, as related by the dying
man is a tale of accidental incest told quietly, earnestly, but without
a suggestion of Sterne’s wit or sentiment.In the next section, emanating entirely from Bode, “Vom
Gesundheitstrinken,” the author is somewhat more successful in catching
the spirit of Sterne in his buoyancy, and in his whimsical anecdote
telling: it purports to be an essay by the author’s friend, Grubbius.The last addition made by Bode[45] introduces once more Yorick’s
sentiment relative to man’s treatment of the animal world.Yorick,
walking in the garden of an acquaintance, shoots a sparrow and meets
with reproof from the owner of the garden.Yorick protests prosaically
that it was only a sparrow, yet on being assured that it was also a
living being, he succumbs to vexation and self-reproof at his own
failure to be true to his own higher self.A similar regret, a similar
remorse at sentimental thoughtlessness, is recorded of the real Yorick
in connection with the Franciscan, Lorenzo.But there is present in
Sterne’s story the inevitable element of caprice in thought or action,
the whimsical inconsistency of varying moods, not a mere commonplace
lapse from a sentimental creed.In one case, Yorick errs through whim,
in the other, merely through heedlessness.Bode’s attitude toward the continuation of Eugenius and the general
nature of his additions have been suggested by the above account.A résumé of the omissions and the verbal changes would indicate that
they were made frequently because of the indecency of the original;
the transference of the immorality in the episode of M’lle.Laborde and
Walter Shandy, if the reason above suggested be allowed, is further
proof of Bode’s solicitude for Yorick’s moral reputation.Yet the
retention of the episode “Les Gants d’Amour” in its entirety, and of
parts of the continued story of the Piedmontese, may seem inconsistent
and irreconcilable with any absolute objection on Bode’s part other than
a quantitative one, to this loathesome element of the Eugenius
narrative.Albrecht Wittenberg[46] in a letter to Jacobi, dated Hamburg, April 21,
1769, says he reads that Riedel is going to continue “Yorick’s Reisen,”
and comments upon the exceedingly difficult undertaking.Nothing further
is known of this plan of Riedel’s.[Footnote 1: Various German authorities date the Sentimental
    Journey erroneously 1767.753; Koberstein, III,
    p.463; Hirsching, XIII, pp.[Footnote 2: The reviewer in the _Allg.deutsche Bibl._ (Anhang
    I-XII, vol.896) implies a contemporary cognizance of this
    aid to its popularity.He notes the interest in accounts of
    travels and fears that some readers will be disappointed after
    taking up the book.Some French books of travel, notably
    Chapelle’s “Voyage en Provence,” 1656, were read with appreciation
    by cultivated Germany and had their influence parallel and
    auxiliary to Sterne’s.][Footnote 3: In the Seventh Book of Tristram Shandy.[Footnote 5: The emotional groundwork in Germany which furthered
    the appreciation of the Journey, and the sober sanity of British
    common sense which choked its English sweep, are admirably and
    typically illustrated in the story of the meeting of Fanny Burney
    and Sophie la Roche, as told in the diary of the former (“The
    Diary and Letters of Frances Burney, Madame D’Arblay,” Boston,
    1880, I, p.291), entries for September 11 and 17, 1786.On their
    second meeting Mme.D’Arblay writes of the German sentimentalist:
    “Madame la Roche then rising and fixing her eyes filled with tears
    on my face, while she held both my hands, in the most melting
    accents exclaimed, ‘Miss Borni, la plus chère, la plus digne des
    Anglaises, dites--moi--m’aimez vous?’” Miss Burney is quite
    sensibly frank in her inability to fathom this imbecility.Ludmilla Assing (“Sophie la Roche,” Berlin, 1859, pp.273-280)
    calls Miss Burney cold and petty.][Footnote 6: So heartily did the Germans receive the Sentimental
    Journey that it was felt ere long to be almost a German book.The author of “Ueber die schönen Geister und Dichter des 18ten
    Jahrhunderts vornehmlich unter den Deutschen,” by J. C. Fritsch
    (?)(Lemgo, 1771), gives the book among German stories and
    narratives (pp.177-9) along with Hagedorn, Gellert, Wieland and
    others.He says of the first parts of the Sentimental Journey,
    “zwar.aus dem Englischen übersetzt; kann aber für national
    passieren.”]

    authority.der schönen Wissenschaften_ in its

    edition, VII, p.553 claims Lessing as responsible for the
    translation of the Journey, and also of Shandy.The success of the
    “Empfindsame Reise” and the popularity of Sterne are quite enough
    to account for the latter translation and there is no evidence of
    urging on Lessing’s part.A similar statement is found in Gervinus

    Bode is engaged upon the work, and gives some suggestions to him
    about it.][Footnote 21: See Bode’s Introduction, p. iii, iv.deutsche Bibl._, Anhang, I-XII, Vol.[Footnote 22: Strangely enough the first use of this word which

STERNE IN GERMANY AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY


The publication of the Sentimental Journey, as implied in the previous
chapter, brought Sterne into vital connection with literary impulses and
emotional experiences in Germany, and his position as a leader was at
once recognized.Because of the immediate translations, the reviews of
the English original are markedly few, even in journals which gave
considerable attention to English literary affairs.The _Neue Bibliothek
der schönen Wissenschaften_[1] purposely delays a full review of the
book because of the promised translation, and contents itself with the
remark, “that we have not read for a long time anything more full of
sentiment and humor.” Yet, strangely enough, the translation is never
worthily treated, only the new edition of 1771 is mentioned,[2] with
especial praise of Füger’s illustrations.Other journals devote long reviews to the new favorite: according to the
_Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen_[3] all the learned
periodicals vied with one another in lavish bestowal of praise upon
these Journeys.The journals consulted go far toward justifying this
statement.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ reviews both the Bode and
Mittelstedt renderings, together with Bode’s translation of Stevenson’s
continuation, in the second volume of the Anhang to Volumes I-XII.[4]
The critique of Bode’s work defines, largely in the words of the book
itself, the peculiar purpose and method of the Journey, and comments
briefly but with frank enthusiasm on the various touching incidents of
the narrative: “Nur ein von der Natur verwahrloseter bleibt dabei kalt
und gleichgültig,” remarks the reviewer.The conception of Yorick’s
personal character, which prevailed in Germany, obtained by a process of
elimination and misunderstanding, is represented by this critic when he
records without modifying his statement: “Various times Yorick shows
himself as the most genuine foe of self-seeking, of immoral _double
entendre_, and particularly of assumed seriousness, and he scourges them
emphatically.” The review of the third and fourth parts contains a
similar and perhaps even more significant passage illustrating the view
of Yorick’s character held by those who did not know him and had the
privilege of admiring him only in his writings and at a safe distance.“Yorick,” he says, “although he sometimes brings an event, so to speak,
to the brink of an indecorous issue, manages to turn it at once with the
greatest delicacy to a decorous termination.Or he leaves it incomplete
under such circumstances that the reader is impressed by the rare
delicacy of mind of the author, and can never suspect that such a man,
who never allows a _double entendre_ to enter his mind without a blush,
has entertained an indecent idea.” This view is derived from a somewhat
short-sighted reading of the Sentimental Journey: the obvious Sterne of
Tristram Shandy, and the more insidiously concealed creator of the
Journey could hardly be characterized discriminatingly by such a
statement.Sterne’s cleverness consists not in suggesting his own
innocence of imagination, but in the skill with which he assures his
reader that he is master of the situation, and that no possible
interpretation of the passage has escaped his intelligence.To the
Mittelstedt translation is accorded in this review the distinction of
being, in the rendering of certain passages, more correct than Bode’s.A reviewer in the _Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitung_[5] treats of the
Sentimental Journey in the Mittelstedt translation.He is evidently
unfamiliar with the original and does not know of Bode’s work, yet his
admiration is unbounded, though his critique is without distinction or
discrimination.The _Neue Critische Nachrichten_[6] of Greifswald gives
a review of Bode’s rendering in which a parallel with Shakespeare is
suggested.The original mingling of instruction and waggery is commented
upon, imitation is discouraged, and the work is held up as a test,
through appreciation or failure to appreciate, of a reader’s ability to
follow another’s feelings, to understand far-away hints and allusions,
to follow the tracks of an irregular and errant wit.The _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_ for October 29, 1768,
regards the book in Bode’s translation as an individual, unparalleled
work of genius and discourses at length upon its beneficent medicinal
effects upon those whose minds and hearts are perplexed and clouded.The wanton passages are acknowledged, but the reviewer asserts that the
author must be pardoned them for the sake of his generous and
kind-hearted thoughts.The Mittelstedt translation is also quoted and
parallel passages are adduced to demonstrate the superiority of Bode’s
translation.The Germans naturally learned to know the continuation of Eugenius
chiefly through Bode’s translation, designated as the third and fourth
volumes of the work, and thus because of the sanction of the
intermediary, were led to regard Stevenson’s tasteless, tedious and
revolting narrative with a larger measure of favor than would presumably
have been accorded to the original, had it been circulated extensively
in Germany.After years the _Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung_[7] implies
incidentally that Bode’s esteeming this continuation worthy of his
attention is a fact to be taken into consideration in judging its
merits, and states that Bode beautified it.Bode’s additions and
alterations were, as has been pointed out, all directly along the line
of the Yorick whom the Germans had made for themselves.It is
interesting to observe that the reviewer of these two volumes of the
continuation in the _Neue Critische Nachrichten_,[8] while recognizing
the inevitability of failure in such a bold attempt, and acknowledging
that the outward form of the work may by its similarity be at first
glance seductive, notes two passages of sentiment “worthy even of a
Yorick,”--the episode “Das Hündchen” and the anecdote of the sparrows
which the traveler shot in the garden: both are additions on Bode’s
part, and have no connection with the original.The reviewer thus
singled out for especial approval two interpolations by the German
translator, incidents which in their conception and narration have not
the true English Yorick ring.The success of the Sentimental Journey increased the interest in the
incomprehensible Shandy.Lange’s new edition of Zückert’s translation
has been noted, and before long Bode[9] was induced to undertake a
German rendering of the earlier and longer novel.This translation was
finished in the summer of 1774, the preface being dated “End of August.”
The foreword is mainly concerned with Goeze’s attack on Bode’s personal
character, a thrust founded on Bode’s connection with the Sentimental
Journey and its continuation.At the close of this introduction Bode
says that, without undervaluing the intelligence of his readers, he had
regarded notes as essential, but because of his esteem for the text,
and a parental affection for the notes, he has foreborne to insert them
here.“So they still lie in my desk, as many as there are of them, but
upon pressing hints they might be washed and combed, and then be
published under the title perhaps of a ‘Real und Verballexicon über
Tristram Shandy’s Leben und Meinungen.’” This hint of a work of his own,
serving as a commentary to Tristram Shandy, has been the occasion of
some discussion.A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[10]
in an account of Bode’s and Wichmann’s renderings of “Tom Jones,” begs
Bode to fulfill the hopes thus raised, saying he could give Yorick’s
friends no more valuable or treasured gift.Böttiger in his biographical
sketch of Bode expressed regret that the work never saw the light,
adding that the work contained so many allusions to contemporary
celebrities and hits upon Bode’s acquaintance that wisdom had consigned
to oblivion.[11] A correspondent, writing to the _Teutscher Merkur_,[12]
minimizes the importance of this so-called commentary, saying “er hatte
nie einen Kommentar der Art,.auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten.Die ganze Sache gründet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen
seinem damaligen Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen
Ironie mit diesem Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.”

The list of subscribers to Bode’s translation contained upwards of 650
names, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg, Gleim,
Fräulein von Göchhausen, Goethe, Hamann, Herder, Hippel, Jacobi,
Klopstock, Schummel, Wieland (five copies), and Zimmermann.The names of
Ebert and Lessing are not on the list.The number of subscribers in
Mitau (twelve) is worthy of note, as illustrating the interest in Sterne
still keenly alive in this small and far away town, undoubtedly a direct
result of the admiration so lavishly expressed in other years by Herder,
Hamann and their circle.The translation was hailed then as a masterly achievement of an arduous
task, the difficulties of which are only the less appreciated because of
the very excellence of the performance.It contrasts most strikingly
with its clumsy predecessor in its approximation to Sterne’s deftness of
touch, his delicate turns of phrase, his seemingly obvious and facile,
but really delicate and accurate choice of expression.Zückert was
heavy, commonplace, uncompromisingly literal and bristling with
inaccuracies.Bode’s work was unfortunately not free from errors in
spite of its general excellence, yet it brought the book within reach of
those who were unable to read it in English, and preserved, in general
with fidelity, the spirit of the original.The reviews were prodigal of
praise.Wieland’s expressions of admiration were full-voiced and
extensive.[13]

The _Wandsbecker Bothe_ for October 28, 1774, asserts that many readers
in England had not understood the book as well as Bode, a frequent
expression of inordinate commendation; that Bode follows close on the
heels of Yorick on his most intimate expeditions.The _Frankfurter
Gelehrte Anzeigen_[14] copies in full the translation of the first
chapter as both Zückert and Bode rendered it, and praises the latter in
unqualified terms; Bode appears as “Yorick’s rescuer.” Several years
later, in the _Deutsches Museum_, the well-known French translation of
Shandy by Frenais is denounced as intolerable (unerträglich) to a German
who is acquainted with Bode’s,[15] an opinion emphasized later in the
same magazine[16] by Joseph von Retzer.Indeed, upon these two
translations from Sterne rests Bode’s reputation as a translator.His
“Tom Jones” was openly criticised as bearing too much of Sterne,[17] so
great was the influence of Yorick upon the translator.Klamer Schmidt in
a poem called “Klamersruh, eine ländlich malerische Dichtung,”[18]
dilating upon his favorite authors during a country winter, calls Bode
“our Sterne” and “the ideal translator,” and in some verses by the same
poet, quoted in the article on Bode in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog,”[19]
is found a very significant stanza expressing Sterne’s immeasurable
obligation to his German translator:

  “Er geht zu dir nun, unser Bode!Empfang ihn, Yoriks Geist!Auch dein
  Erbarmt er sich,
  Errettete vom Tode
  Der Uebersetzer dich!”

Matthison in his “Gruss aus der Heimath,”[20] pays similar tribute in a
vision connected with a visit to Bode’s resting-place in Weimar.It is a
fanciful relation: as Bode’s shade is received with jubilation and
delight in the Elysian Fields by Cervantes, Rabelais, Montaigne,
Fielding and Sterne, the latter censures Bode for distrusting his own
creative power, indicating that he might have stood with the group just
enumerated, that the fame of being “the most excellent transcriber” of
his age should not have sufficed.In view of all this marked esteem, it is rather surprising to find a few
years later a rather sweeping, if apologetic, attack on the rendering of
Shandy.J. L. Benzler, the librarian of Graf Stolberg at Wernigerode,
published in 1801 a translation of Shandy which bore the legend “Newly
translated into German,” but was really a new edition of Bode’s work
with various corrections and alterations.[21] Benzler claims in his
preface that there had been no translation of the masterpiece worthy of
the original, and this was because the existing translation was from the
pen of Bode, in whom one had grown to see the very ideal of a
translator, and because praise had been so lavishly bestowed on the work
by the critics.He then asserts that Bode never made a translation which
did not teem with mistakes; he translated incorrectly through
insufficient knowledge of English, confusing words which sound alike,
made his author say precisely the opposite of what he really did say,
was often content with the first best at hand, with the half-right, and
often erred in taste;--a wholesale and vigorous charge.After such a
disparagement, Benzler disclaims all intention to belittle Bode, or his
service, but he condescendingly ascribes Bode’s failure to his lowly
origin, his lack of systematic education, and of early association with
the cultured world.Benzler takes Bode’s work as a foundation and
rewrites.Some of his changes are distinctly advantageous, and that so
few of these errors in Bode’s translation were noted by contemporary
critics is a proof of their ignorance of the original, or their utter
confidence in Bode.[22] Benzler in his preface of justification
enumerates several extraordinary blunders[23] and then concludes with a
rather inconsistent parting thrust at Bode, the perpetrator of such
nonsense, at the critics who could overlook such errors and praise the
work inordinately, and at the public who ventured to speak with delight
of the work, knowing it only in such a rendering.Benzler was severely
taken to task in the _Neue Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[24] for his
shamelessness in rewriting Bode’s translation with such comparatively
insignificant alterations, for printing on the title page in brazen
effrontery “newly translated into German,” and for berating Bode for his
failure after cursing him with condescension.Passages are cited to
demonstrate the comparative triviality of Benzler’s work.A brief
comparison of the two translations shows that Benzler often translates
more correctly than his predecessor, but still more often makes
meaningless alterations in word-order, or in trifling words where
nothing is to be gained by such a change.The same year Benzler issued a similar revision of the Sentimental
Journey,[25] printing again on the title page “newly translated into
German.” The _Neue Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[26] greets this
attempt with a similar tart review, containing parallel quotations as
before, proving Benzler’s inconsiderate presumption.Here Benzler had to
face Bode’s assertion that both Lessing and Ebert had assisted in the
work, and that the former had in his kindness gone through the whole
book.Benzler treats this fact rather cavalierly and renews his attack
on Bode’s rendering.Benzler resented this review and replied to it in a
later number of the same periodical.[27]

Now that a century and more has elapsed, and personal acrimony can no
longer play any part in criticism, one may justly admit Benzler’s
service in calling attention to inaccurate and inadequate translation,
at the same time one must condemn utterly his manner of issuing his
emendations.In 1831 there appeared a translation of Tristram Shandy
which was again but a revision of Bode’s work.It bore on the title page
“Neu übertragen von W. H.,” and contained a sketch of Sterne’s life.[28]

In the nineties there seemed to be a renewal of Yorick enthusiasm, and
at this time was brought forth, at Halle in 1794, a profusely annotated
edition of the Sentimental Journey,[29] which was, according to the
anonymous editor, a book not to be read, but to be studied.Claim is
made that the real meaning of the book may be discovered only after
several careful readings, that “empfindsam” in some measure was here
used in the sense of philosophical, that the book should be treated as a
work of philosophy, though clad in pleasing garb; that it should be
thought out according to its merits, not merely read.Yorick’s failure
to supply his chapters with any significant or alluring chapter-headings
(probably the result of indolence on his part) is here interpreted as
extraordinary sagacity, for he thereby lessens the expectations and
heightens the effect.“Eine Empfindungs-reise” is declared to be a more
suitable name than “Empfindsame Reise,” and comment is made upon the
purpose of the Journey, the gathering of material for anatomical study
of the human heart.The notes are numerous and lengthy, constituting a
quarter to a third of the book, but are replete with padding, pointless
babble and occasional puerile inaccuracies.They are largely attempts to
explain and to moralize upon Yorick’s emotions,--a verbose, childish,
witless commentary.The Wortregister contains fourteen pages in double
columns of explanations, in general differing very little from the kind
of information given in the notes.The _Allgemeine Litteratur
Zeitung_[30] devotes a long review chiefly to the explanation of the
errors in this volume, not the least striking of which is the
explanation of the reference to Smelfungus, whom everyone knows to have
been Smollett: “This learned Smelfungus appears to have written nothing
but the Journey which is here mentioned.”[31] As an explanation of the
initial “H” used by Sterne for Hume, the note is given, “The author ‘H’
was perhaps a poor one.”[32]

Sterne’s letters were issued first in London in 1775, a rather
surprisingly long time after his death, when one considers how great was
Yorick’s following.According to the prefatory note of Lydia Sterne de
Medalle in the collection which she edited and published, it was the
wish of Mrs.Sterne that the correspondence of her husband, which was in
her possession, be not given to the world, unless other letters bearing
his name should be published.This hesitation on her part must be
interpreted in such a way as to cast a favorable light on this much
maligned gentlewoman, as a delicate reticence on her part, a desire to
retain these personal documents for herself.[33] The power of this
sentiment must be measured by her refraining from publishing during the
five years which intervened between her husband’s death and her own,
March, 1768 to January, 1773--years which were embittered by the
distress of straitened circumstances.It will be remembered that an
effort was made by Mrs.Sterne and her daughter to retrieve their
fortunes by a life of Sterne which was to be a collaboration by
Stevenson and Wilkes, and urgent indeed was Lydia Sterne’s appeal to
these friends of her father to fulfill their promises and lend their
aid.Even when this hope had to be abandoned early in 1770, through the
faithlessness of Sterne’s erstwhile companions, the widow and daughter
turned to other possibilities rather than to the correspondence, though
in the latter lay a more assured means of accomplishing a temporary
revival of their prosperity.This is an evidence of fine feeling on the
part of Sterne’s widow, with which she has never been duly credited.But an anonymous editor published early in 1775[34] a volume entitled
“Letters from Yorick to Eliza,” a brief little collection, the source of
which has never been clear, but whose genuineness has never been
questioned.The editor himself waives all claim to proof “which might be
drawn concerning their authenticity from the character of the gentleman
who had the perusal of them, and with Eliza’s permission, faithfully
copied them at Bombay.”

In July of this same year[35] was published a volume entitled “Sterne’s
Letters to His Friends on Various Occasions, to which is added his
History of a Watchcoat with Explanatory Notes,” containing twelve
letters (one by Dr.Eustace) and the watchcoat story.Some of these
letters had appeared previously in British magazines, and one, copied
from the _London Magazine_, was translated in the _Wandsbecker Bothe_
for April 16, 1774.[36] A translation of the same letter was given in
the _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1774, pp.Three of these
letters only are accepted by Prof.7, 124, the letter
of Dr.4-11 have been judged as
of doubtful authenticity.11 and 12 (“I beheld her
tender look” and “I feel the weight of obligation”) are in the standard
ten-volume edition of Sterne,[37] but the last letter is probably
spurious also.The publication of the letters from Yorick to Eliza was the
justification afforded Lydia Sterne de Medalle for issuing her father’s
correspondence according to her mother’s request: the other volume was
not issued till after it was known that Sterne’s daughter was engaged in
the task of collecting and editing his correspondence.Indeed, the
editor expressly states in his preface that it is not the purpose of the
book to forestall Mme.Medalle’s promised collection; that the letters
in this volume are not to be printed in hers.Medalle added to
her collection the “Fragment in the manner of Rabelais” and the
invaluable, characteristic scrap of autobiography, which was written
particularly for “my Lydia.” The work appeared at Becket’s in three
volumes, and the dedication to Garrick was dated June, 1775; but, as the
notice in the _Monthly Review_ for October[39] asserts that they have
“been published but a few days,” this date probably represents the time
of the completion of the task, or the inception of the printer’s
work.[40] During the same year the spurious letters from Eliza to Yorick
were issued.Naturally Sterne’s letters found readers in Germany, the Yorick-Eliza
correspondence being especially calculated to awaken response.[41] The
English edition of the “Letters from Yorick to Eliza” was reviewed in
the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_,[42] with a hint that
the warmth of the letters might easily lead to a suspicion of unseemly
relationship, but the reviewer contends that virtue and rectitude are
preserved in the midst of such extraordinary tenderness, so that one may
interpret it as a Platonic rather than a sensual affection.Yet this
review cannot be designated as distinctive of German opinion, for it
contains no opinion not directly to be derived from the editor’s
foreword, and that alone; indeed, the wording suggests decidedly that
source.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung_[43] for April 15, 1775,
reviews the same English edition, but the notice consists of an
introductory statement of Eliza’s identity and translation of parts of
three letters, the “Lord Bathurst letter,” the letter involving the
criticism of Eliza’s portraits,[44] and the last letter to Eliza.The
translation is very weak, abounding in elementary errors; for example,
“She has got your picture and likes it” becomes “Sie hat Ihr Bildniss
gemacht, es ist ähnlich,” and “I beheld you.as a very plain woman”
is rendered “und hielt Sie für nichts anders als eine Frau.” The same
journal,[45] August 5, reviews the second collection of Sterne’s
letters, but there is no criticism, merely an introductory statement
taken from the preface, and the translation of two letters, the one to
Mistress V., “Of two bad cassocs, fair lady,” and the epistle beginning,
“I snatch half an hour while my dinner is getting ready.” The
_Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen_, 1776, p.382, also gives in a review
information concerning this anonymous collection, but no criticism.One would naturally look to Hamburg for translations of these epistles.In the very year of their appearance in England we find “Yorick’s Briefe
an Eliza,” Hamburg, bey C. E. Bohn, 1775;[46] “Briefe von Eliza an
Yorick,” Hamburg, bey Bode, 1775; and “Briefe von (Yorick) Sterne an
seine Freunde nebst seiner Geschichte eines Ueberrocks,” Hamburg, bey
Bohn, 1775.The translator’s name is not given, but there is every
reason to suppose that it was the faithful Bode, though only the first
volume is mentioned in Jördens’ account of him, and under his name in
Goedeke’s “Grundriss.” Contemporary reviewers attributed all three books
to Bode, and internal evidence goes to prove it.[47]

The first volume contains no translator’s preface, and the second, the
spurious Eliza letters, only a brief footnote to the translation of the
English preface.In this note Bode’s identity is evident in the
following quotation: He says he has translated the letters “because I
believe that they will be read with pleasure, and because I fancy I have
a kind of vocation to give in German everything that Sterne has written,
or whatever has immediate relation to his writings.” This note is dated
Hamburg, September 16, 1775.In the third volume, the miscellaneous
collection, there is a translator’s preface in which again Bode’s hand
is evident.He says he knows by sure experience that Sterne’s writings
find readers in Germany; he is assured of the authenticity of the
letters, but is in doubt whether the reader is possessed of sufficient
knowledge of the attending circumstances to render intelligible the
allusion of the watchcoat story.To forfend the possibility of such
dubious appreciation, the account of the watchcoat episode is copied
word for word from Bode’s introduction to the “Empfindsame Reise.”[48]

In this same year, an unknown translator issued in a single volume a
rendering of these three collections.Medalle’s collection was brought out in Leipzig in an anonymous
translation, which has been attributed to Christian Felix Weisse.[50]
Its title was “Lorenz Sterne’s Briefe an seine vertrautesten Freunde
nebst einem Fragment im Geschmack des Rabelais und einer von ihm selbst
verfassten Nachricht von seinem Leben und seiner Familie, herausgegeben
von seiner Tochter Mad.Medalle,” Leipzig, 1776, pp.Bode’s translation of Yorick’s letters to Eliza is reviewed in the
_Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung_, August 9, 1775, with quotation of the
second letter in full.The same journal notes the translation of the
miscellaneous collection, November 4, 1775, giving in full the letter of
Dr.Eustace and Sterne’s reply.[51] The _Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek_[52] reviews together the three Hamburg volumes (Bode) and
the Leipzig volume containing the same letters.The utter innocence, the
unquestionably Platonic character of the relations between Yorick and
Eliza is accepted fully.With keen, critical judgment the reviewer is
inclined to doubt the originality of the Eliza letters.Two letters by
Yorick are mentioned particularly, letters which bear testimony to
Yorick’s practical benevolence: one describing his efforts in behalf of
a dishonored maiden, and one concerning the old man who fell into
financial difficulties.[53] Both the translations win approval, but
Bode’s is preferred; they are designated as doubtless his.The “Briefe
an Elisa” (Bode’s translation) are noticed in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte
Anzeigen_, October 3 and 6, 1775, with unrestrained praise of the
translator, and vigorous asseveration of their authenticity.It is
recognized fully that the relation as disclosed was extraordinary among
married people, even Sterne’s amazing statement concerning the fragile
obstacles which stood in the way of their desires is noted.Yet the
Yorick of these letters is accorded undisguised admiration.His love is
exalted above that of Swift for Stella, Waller for Sacharissa, Scarron
for Maintenon,[54] and his godly fear as here exhibited is cited to
offset the outspoken avowal of dishonoring desire.[55] Hamann in a
letter to Herder, June 26, 1780, speaks of the Yorick-Eliza
correspondence quite disparagingly.[56]

In 1787 another volume of Sterne letters was issued in London, giving
English and German on opposite pages.[57] There are but six letters and
all are probably spurious.In 1780 there was published a volume of confessedly spurious letters
entitled “Briefe von Yorick und Elisen, wie sie zwischen ihnen konnten
geschrieben werden.”[58] The introduction contains some interesting
information for the determination of the genuineness of the Sterne
letters.[59] The editor states that the author had written these letters
purely as a diversion, that the editor had proposed their publication,
but was always met with refusal until there appeared in London a little
volume of letters which their editor emphatically declared to be
genuine.This is evidently the volume published by the anonymous editor
in 1775, and our present editor declares that he knows Nos.4-10 were
from the same pen as the present confessedly spurious collection.They
were mere efforts originally, but, published in provincial papers, found
their way into other journals, and the editor goes on to say, that,
to his astonishment, he saw one of these epistles included in Lydia
Medalle’s collection.5, the one beginning, “The
first time I have dipped my pen in the ink-horn.” These events induced
the author to allow the publication.The book itself consists mostly of
a kind of diary kept by Yorick to send to Eliza at Madeira and later to
India, and a corresponding journal written by Eliza on the vessel and at
Madeira.Yorick’s sermons were inevitably less potent in their appeal, and the
editions and translations were less numerous.In spite of obvious
effort, Sterne was unable to infuse into his homiletical discourses any
considerable measure of genuine Shandeism, and his sermons were never as
widely popular as his two novels, either among those who sought him for
whimsical pastime or for sentimental emotion.The
early Swiss translation has been duly noted.The third volume of the Zürich edition, which appeared in 1769,
contained the “Reden an Esel,” which the reviewer in the _Allgemeine
deutsche Bibliothek_[60] with acute penetration designates as spurious.Another translation of these sermons was published at Leipzig, according
to the editor of a later edition[61] (Thorn, 1795), in the same year as
the Zürich issue, 1769.The _Berlinische Monatsschrift_[62] calls attention to the excellence of
the work and quotes the sermons at considerable length.The comment
contains the erroneous statement that Sterne was a dissenter, and
opposed to the established church.The translation published at Thorn in
1795, evidently building on this information, continues the error, and,
in explanation of English church affairs, adds as enlightenment the
thirty-nine articles.This translation is confessedly a working-over of
the Leipzig translation already mentioned.It is difficult to discover
how these sermons ever became attached to Sterne’s name, and one can
hardly explain the fact that such a magazine as the _Berlinische
Monatsschrift_[63] should at that late date publish an article so flatly
contradictory to everything for which Sterne stood, so diametrically
opposed to his career, save with the understanding that gross ignorance
attended the original introduction and early imitation of Yorick, and
that this incomprehension, or one-sided appreciation of the real Sterne
persisted in succeeding decades.The German Yorick was the champion of
the oppressed and downtrodden.The author of the “Sermons to Asses”
appeared as such an opponent of coercion and arbitrary power in church
and state, an upholder of human rights; hence, possibly, the authorship
of this book was attributed to Sterne by something the same process as
that which, in the age of heroic deeds, associated a miscellaneous
collection of performances with a popular hero.The “Sermons to Asses”
were written by Rev.James Murray (1732-1782), a noted dissenting
minister, long pastor of High Bridge Chapel in Newcastle-on-Tyne.They
were published in London in 1768 and dedicated to G. W., J. W., W. R.
and M.M.--George Whitfield, John Wesley, William Romaine and Martin
Madan.The English people are represented as burden-bearing asses laden
with oppression in the shape of taxes and creeds.[64] They are directed
against the power of the established church.It is needless to state
that England never associated these sermons with Sterne.[65] The
English edition was also briefly reviewed in the _Hamburgische
Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_[66] without connecting the work with
Sterne.The error was made later, possibly by the translator of the
Zürich edition.The new collection of Sterne’s sermons published by Cadell in 1769,
Vols.V, VI, VII, is reviewed by _Unterhaltungen_.[67] A selection from
Sterne’s sermon on the Prodigal Son was published in translation in the
_Hamburgische Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ for April 13, 1768.The new
collection of sermons was translated by A. E. Klausing and published at
Leipzig in 1770, containing eighteen sermons.[68]

Both during Sterne’s life and after his death books were published
claiming him as their author.In England contemporary criticism
generally stigmatized these impertinent attempts as dubious, or
undoubtedly fraudulent.The spurious ninth volume of Shandy has been
mentioned.[69] The “Sermons to Asses” just mentioned also belong here,
and, with reservation, also Stevenson’s continuation of the Sentimental
Journey, with its claim to recognition through the continuator’s
statement of his relation to Yorick.There remain also a few other books
which need to be mentioned because they were translated into German and
played their part there in shaping the German idea of Yorick.In
general, it may be said that German criticism was never acute in judging
these products, partially perhaps because they were viewed through the
medium of an imperfectly mastered foreign tongue, a mediocre or an
adapted translation.These books obtained relatively a much more
extensive recognition in Germany than in England.In 1769 a curious conglomerate was brought over and issued under the
lengthy descriptive title: “Yoricks Betrachtungen über verschiedene
wichtige und angenehme Gegenstände.Nemlich über Nichts, Ueber Etwas,
Ueber das Ding, Ueber die Regierung, Ueber den Toback, Ueber die Nasen,
Ueber die Quaksalber, Ueber die Hebammen, Ueber den Homunculus, Ueber
die Steckenpferde, Ueber das Momusglas, Ueber die Ausschweifungen, Ueber
die Dunkelkeit im Schreiben, Ueber den Unsinn, Ueber die Verbindung der
Ideen, Ueber die Hahnreiter, Ueber den Mann in dem Monde, Ueber
Leibnitzens Monaden, Ueber das was man Vertu nennt, Ueber das Gewissen,
Ueber die Trunkenheit, Ueber den Nachtstuhl, Betrachtungen über
Betrachtungen.--neque--cum lectulus, aut me Porticus excepit, desum
mihi, Horat.” Frankfurt und Leipzig, 1769, 8vo.The book purported to be
a collection of Sterne’s earliest lucubrations, and the translator
expresses his astonishment that no one had ever translated them before,
although they were first issued in 1760.It is without doubt the
translation of an English volume entitled “Yorick’s Meditations upon
interesting and important subjects,” published by Stevens in London,
1760.[70] It had been forgotten in England long before some German
chanced upon it.The preface closes with a long doggerel rhyme, which,
the translator says, he has purposely left untranslated.It is, however,
beyond the shadow of a doubt original with him, as its contents prove.Yorick in the Elysian Fields is supposed to address himself, he
“anticipates his fate and perceives beforehand that at least one German
critic would deem him worthy of his applause.”

  “Go on, poor Yorik, try once more
  In German Dress, thy fate of yore,
  Expect few Critics, such, as by
  The bucket of Philosophy
  From out the bottom of the well
  May draw the Sense of what you tell
  And spy what wit and Morals sound
  Are in thy Rambles to be found.”

After a passage in which the rhymester enlarges upon the probability of
distorted judgment, he closes with these lines:

  “Dire Fate!but for all that no worse,
  You shall be WIELAND’S Hobby-Horse,
  So to HIS candid Name, unbrib’d
  These meditations be inscrib’d.”

This was at the time of Wieland’s early enthusiasm, when he was probably
contemplating, if not actually engaged upon a translation of Tristram
Shandy.“Thy fate of yore” in the second line is evidently a poetaster’s
acceptation of an obvious rhyme and does not set Yorick’s German
experience appreciably into the past.The translator supplies frequent
footnotes explaining the allusions to things specifically English.He
makes occasional comparison with German conditions, always with the
claim that Germany is better off, and needs no such satire.The
_Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitungen_ for June 1, 1769, devotes a review
of considerable length to this translation; in it the reviewer asserts
that one would have recognized the father of this creation even if
Yorick’s name had not stood on its forehead; that it closely resembles
its fellows even if one must place it a degree below the Journey.The
_Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek_[71] throws no direct suspicion on the
authenticity, but with customary insight and sanity of criticism finds
in this early work “a great deal that is insipid and affected.” The
_Deutsche Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_, however, in a review
which shows a keen appreciation of Sterne’s style, openly avows an
inclination to question the authenticity, save for the express statement
of the translator; the latter it agrees to trust.[72] The book is placed
far below the Sentimental Journey, below Shandy also, but far above the
artificial tone of many other writers then popular.This relative
ordering of Sterne’s works is characteristic of German criticism.In the
latter part of the review its author seizes on a mannerism, the
exaggerated use of which emphatically sunders the book from the genuine
Sterne, the monotonous repetition of the critic’s protests and Yorick’s
verbal conflicts with them.Sterne himself used this device frequently,
but guardedly, and in ever-changing variety.Its careless use betrays
the mediocre imitator.[73]

The more famous Koran was also brought to German territory and enjoyed
there a recognition entirely beyond that accorded it in England.This
book was first given to the world in London as the “Posthumous Works of
a late celebrated Genius deceased;”[74] a work in three parts, bearing
the further title, “The Koran, or the Life, Character and Sentiments of
Tria Juncta in Uno, M. N. A., Master of No Arts.” Richard Griffith was
probably the real author, but it was included in the first collected
edition of Sterne’s works, published in Dublin, 1779.[75] The work
purports to be, in part, an autobiography of Sterne, in which the late
writer lays bare the secrets of his life, his early debauchery, his
father’s unworthiness, his profligate uncle, the ecclesiastic, and the
beginning of his literary career by advertising for hack work in London,
being in all a confused mass of impossible detail, loose notes and
disconnected opinion, which contemporary English reviews stigmatize as
manifestly spurious, “an infamous attempt to palm the united effusions
of dullness and indecency upon the world as the genuine production of
the late Mr.Sterne.”[76]

In France the book was accepted as genuine and it was translated (1853)
by Alfred Hédouin as an authentic work of Sterne.In Germany, too,
it seems to have been recognized with little questioning as to its
genuineness; even in recent years Robert Springer, in an article
treating of Goethe’s relation to the Koran, quite openly contends for
its authenticity.[77]

Since a German translation appeared in the following year (1771), the
German reviews do not, in the main, concern themselves with the English
original.The _Neues Bremisches Magazin_,[78] however, censures the book
quite severely, but the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[79]
welcomes it with unquestioning praise.The German rendering was by
Johann Gottfried Gellius, and the title was “Yorick’s Nachgelassene
Werke.”[80] The _Deutsche Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[81]
does acknowledge the doubtful authorship but accepts completely its
Yorick tone and whim--“one cannot tell the copyist from the original.”
Various characteristics are cited as common to this work and Yorick’s
other writings, the contrast, change, confusion, conflict with the
critics and the talk about himself.For the collection of aphorisms,
sayings, fragments and maxims which form the second part of the Koran,
including the “Memorabilia,” the reviewer suggests the name “Sterniana.”
The reviewer acknowledges the occasional failure in attempted thrusts of
wit, the ineffective satire, the immoral innuendo in some passages,
but after the first word of doubt the review passes on into a tone of
seemingly complete acceptation.In 1778 another translation of this book appeared, which has been
ascribed to Bode, though not given by Goedeke, Jördens or Meusel.Its title was “Der Koran, oder Leben und Meynungen des Tria Juncta in
Uno.”[82] The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_[83] treats this work with
full measure of praise.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[84] accepts
the book in this translation as a genuine product of Sterne’s genius.Sammer reprinted the “Koran” (Vienna, 1795, 12mo) and included it in his
nine volume edition of Sterne’s complete works (Vienna, 1798).Goethe’s connection with the “Koran,” which forms the most interesting
phase of its German career, will be treated later.Sterne’s unacknowledged borrowings, his high-handed and extensive
appropriation of work not his own, were noted in Germany, the natural
result of Ferriar’s investigations in England, but they seem never to
have attracted any considerable attention or aroused any serious concern
among Sterne’s admirers so as to imperil his position: the question in
England attached itself as an ungrateful but unavoidable concomitant of
every discussion of Sterne and every attempt to determine his place in
letters.Böttiger tells us that Lessing possessed a copy of Burton’s
“Anatomy of Melancholy,” from which Sterne filched so much wisdom, and
that Lessing had marked in it several of the passages which Ferriar
later advanced as proof of Sterne’s theft.It seems that Bode purchased
this volume at Lessing’s auction in Hamburg.Lessing evidently thought
it not worth while to mention these discoveries, as he is entirely
silent on the subject.Böttiger is, in his account, most unwarrantedly
severe on Ferriar, whom he calls “the bilious Englishman” who attacked
Sterne “with so much bitterness.” This is very far from a veracious
conception of Ferriar’s attitude.The comparative indifference in Germany to this phase of Sterne’s
literary career may well be attributed to the medium by which Ferriar’s
findings were communicated to cultured Germany.The book itself, or the
original Manchester society papers, seem never to have been reprinted or
translated, and Germany learned their contents through a _résumé_
written by Friedrich Nicolai and published in the _Berlinische
Monatsschrift_ for February, 1795, which gives a very sane view of the
subject, one in the main distinctly favorable to Sterne.Nicolai says
Sterne is called with justice “One of the most refined, ingenious and
humorous authors of our time.” He asserts with capable judgment that
Sterne’s use of the borrowed passages, the additions and alterations,
the individual tone which he manages to infuse into them, all preclude
Sterne from being set down as a brainless copyist.Nicolai’s attitude
may be best illustrated by the following passages:

“Germany has authors enough who resemble Sterne in lack of learning.Would that they had a hundredth part of the merits by which he made up
for this lack, or rather which resulted from it.” “We would gladly allow
our writers to take their material from old books, and even many
expressions and turns of style, and indeed whole passages, even if like
Sterne.they claimed it all as their own: only they must be
successful adapters; they must add from their own store of observation
and thought and feeling.The creator of Tristram Shandy does this in
rich measure.”

Nicolai also contends that Sterne was gifted with two characteristic
qualities which were not imitation,--his “Empfindsamkeit” and
“Laune”--and that by the former his works breathe a tender, delicate
beneficence, a character of noble humanity, while by the latter a spirit
of fairest mirth is spread over his pages, so that one may never open
them without a pleasant smile.“The investigation of sources,” he says,
“serves as explanation and does not mean depreciation of an otherwise
estimable author.”

By this article Nicolai choked the malicious criticism of the late
favorite which might have followed from some sources, had another
communicated the facts of Sterne’s thievery.Lichtenberg in the
“Göttingischer Taschenkalender,” 1796, that is, after the publication of
Nicolai’s article, but with reference to Ferriar’s essay in the
Manchester Memoirs, Vol.IV, under the title of “Gelehrte Diebstähle”
does impugn Sterne rather spitefully without any acknowledgment of his
extraordinary and extenuating use of his borrowings.“Yorick,” he says,
“once plucked a nettle which had grown upon Lorenzo’s grave; that was no
labor for him.Who will uproot this plant which Ferriar has set on his?”
Ferriar’s book was reviewed by the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften_, LXII, p. 310.Some of the English imitations of Sterne, which did not actually claim
him as author, also found their way to Germany, and there by a less
discriminating public were joined in a general way to the mass of Yorick
production, and the might of Yorick influence.These works represent
almost exclusively the Sterne of the Sentimental Journey; for the shoal
of petty imitations, explanations and protests which appeared in England
when Shandy was first issued[85] had gone their own petty way to
oblivion before Germany awakened to Sterne’s influence.One of the best known of the English Sentimental Journeys was the work
of Samuel Paterson, entitled, “Another Traveller: or Cursory Remarks and
Critical Observations made upon a Journey through Part of the
Netherlands,--by Coriat Junior,” London, 1768, two volumes.The author
protested in a pamphlet published a little later that his work was not
an imitation of Sterne, that it was in the press before Yorick’s book
appeared; but a reviewer[86] calls his attention to the sentimental
journeying already published in Shandy.This work was translated into
German as “Empfindsame Reisen durch einen Theil der Niederlande,”
Bützow, 1774-1775, 2 Parts, 8vo.The translator was Karl Friedrich
Müchler, who showed his bent in the direction of wit and whim by the
publication of several collections of humorous anecdotes, witty ideas
and satirical skits.[87]

Much later a similar product was published, entitled “Launige Reise
durch Holland in Yoricks[88] Manier, mit Charakterskizzen und Anekdoten
über die Sitten und Gebräuche der Holländer aus dem Englischen,” two
volumes, Zittau und Leipzig, 1795.The translation was by Reichel in
Zittau.[88] This may possibly be Ireland’s “A Picturesque Tour through
Holland, Brabant and part of France, made in 1789,” two volumes, London,
1790.[89] The well-known “Peter Pennyless” was reproduced as
“Empfindsame Gedanken bey verschiedenen Vorfällen von Peter Pennyless,”
Leipzig, Weidmann, 1770.In 1788 there appeared in England a continuation of the Sentimental
Journey[90] in which, to judge from the reviewers, the petty author
outdid Sterne in eccentricities of typography, breaks, dashes, scantily
filled and blank pages.This is evidently the original of “Die neue
empfindsame Reise in Yoriks Geschmack,” Leipzig, 1789, 8vo, pp.168,
which, according to the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ bristles with
such extravagances.[91]

A much more successful attempt was the “Sentimental Journey, Intended as
a Sequel to Mr.Sterne’s, Through Italy, Switzerland and France, by Mr.Shandy,” two volumes, 12mo, 1793.This was evidently the original of
Schink’s work;[92] “Empfindsame Reisen durch Italien, die Schweiz und
Frankreich, ein Nachtrag zu den Yorikschen.Aus und nach dem
Englischen,” Hamburg, Hoffmann, 1794, pp.The translator’s
preface, which is dated Hamburg, March 1794, explains his attitude
toward the work as suggested in the expression “Aus und nach dem
Englischen,” that is, “aus, so lange wie Treue für den Leser Gewinn
schien und nach, wenn Abweichung für die deutsche Darstellung notwendig
war.” He claims to have softened the glaring colors of the original and
to have discarded, or altered the obscene pictures.The author, as
described in the preface, is an illegitimate son of Yorick, named
Shandy, who writes the narrative as his father would have written it,
if he had lived.This assumed authorship proves quite satisfactorily its
connection with the English original, as there, too, in the preface, the
narrator is designated as a base-born son of Yorick.The book is, as a
whole, a fairly successful imitation of Yorick’s manner, and it must be
judged as decidedly superior to Stevenson’s attempt.The author takes up
the story where Sterne left it, in the tavern room with the Piedmontese
lady; and the narrative which follows is replete with allusions to
familiar episodes and sentiments in the real Journey, with sentimental
adventures and opportunities for kindly deeds, and sympathetic tears;
motifs used originally are introduced here, a begging priest with a
snuff-box, a confusion with the Yorick in Hamlet, a poor girl with
wandering mind seated by the wayside, and others equally familiar.It is not possible to determine the extent of Schink’s alterations to
suit German taste, but one could easily believe that the somewhat
lengthy descriptions of external nature, quite foreign to Sterne, were
original with him, and that the episode of the young German lady by the
lake of Geneva, with her fevered admiration for Yorick, and the
compliments to the German nation and the praise for great Germans,
Luther, Leibnitz and Frederick the Great, are to be ascribed to the same
source.He did not rid the book of revolting features, as one might
suppose from his preface.[93] Previous to the publication of the whole
translation, Schink published in the February number of the _Deutsche
Monatsschrift_[94] two sections of his book, “Die Schöne
Obstverkäuferin” and “Elisa.” Later, in the May number, he published
three other fragments, “Turin, Hotel del Ponto,” “Die Verlegenheit,”
“Die Unterredung.”[95]

A few years later Schink published another and very similar volume with
the title, “Launen, Phantasieen und Schilderungen aus dem Tagebuche
eines reisenden Engländers,”[96] Arnstadt und Rudolstadt, 1801, pp.It has not been possible to find an English original, but the translator
makes claim upon one, though confessing alterations to suit his German
readers, and there is sufficient internal evidence to point to a real
English source.The traveler is a haggard, pale-faced English clergyman,
who, with his French servant, La Pierre, has wandered in France and
Italy and is now bound for Margate.Here again we have sentimental
episodes, one with a fair lady in a post-chaise, another with a monk in
a Trappist cloister, apostrophes to the imagination, the sea, and
nature, a new division of travelers, a debate of personal attributes,
constant appeals to his dear Sophie, who is, like Eliza, ever in the
background, occasional references to objects made familiar through
Yorick, as Dessein’s Hotel, and a Yorick-like sympathy with the dumb
beast; in short, an open imitation of Sterne, but the motifs from Sterne
are here more mixed and less obvious.There is, as in the former book,
much more enthusiasm for nature than is characteristic of Sterne; and
there is here much more miscellaneous material, such, for example,
as the tale of the two sisters, which betrays no trace of Sterne’s
influence.The latter part of the volume is much less reminiscent of
Yorick and suggests interpolation by the translator.[97]

Near the close of the century was published “Fragments in the manner of
Sterne,” 8vo, Debrett, 1797, which, according to the _Monthly
Review_,[98] caught in large measure the sentimentality, pathos and
whimsicality of Sterne’s style.The British Museum catalogue suggests
J. Brandon as its author.This was reprinted by Nauck in Leipzig in
1800, and a translation was given to the world by the same publisher in
the same year, with the added title: “Ein Seitenstück zu Yoricks
empfindsamen Reisen.” The translation is attributed by Kayser to Aug.Wilhelmi, the pseudonym of August Wilhelm Meyer.[99] Here too belongs
“Mariens Briefe nebst Nachricht von ihrem Tode, aus dem
Englischen,”[100] which was published also under the title: “Yoricks
Empfindsame Reisen durch Frankreich und Italien,” 5th vol., 8vo,
Weissenfels, Severin, Mitzky in Leipzig, 1795.[Footnote 1: VI, 1, p.[Footnote 2: XII, 1, p.[Footnote 3: August 28, 1769.689-91, October 31, 1768.]37, 1769, review is signed “Z.”]

    discussion of this question.Hédouin in the appendix of his “Life

    Fitzgerald’s rather scornful characterization of the French
    critics who received the work as Sterne’s (see Life of Sterne,
    1864, II, p. 429).Hédouin refers to Jules Janin (“Essai sur la

    against the authenticity.This is probably the article to be found
    in his collection of Essays, “XIX Siècle, Les oeuvres et les

    assertion that the Koran appeared seven years after Sterne’s
    death, but he is probably building on the incorrect statement in
    the _Quarterly Review_ (XCIV, pp.Springer also asserts
    erroneously that it was never published in Sterne’s collected
    works.He is evidently disposed to make a case for the Koran and
    finds really his chief proof in the fact that both Goethe and Jean
    Paul accepted it unquestioningly.Bodmer quotes Sterne from the
    Koran in a letter to Denis, April 4, 1771, “M.by Retzer, Wien, 1801, II, p.120, and other German

STERNE’S INFLUENCE IN GERMANY


Thus in manifold ways Sterne was introduced into German life and
letters.[1] He stood as a figure of benignant humanity, of lavish
sympathy with every earthly affliction, he became a guide and mentor,[2]
an awakener and consoler, and probably more than all, a sanction for
emotional expression.Not only in literature, but in the conduct of life
was Yorick judged a preceptor.The most important attempt to turn
Yorick’s teachings to practical service in modifying conduct in human
relationships was the introduction and use of the so-called
“Lorenzodosen.” The considerable popularity of this remarkable conceit
is tangible evidence of Sterne’s influence in Germany and stands in
striking contrast to the wavering enthusiasm, vigorous denunciation and
half-hearted acknowledgment which marked Sterne’s career in England.A century of criticism has disallowed Sterne’s claim as a prophet, but
unquestionably he received in Germany the honors which a foreign land
proverbially accords.To Johann Georg Jacobi, the author of the “Winterreise” and
“Sommerreise,” two well-known imitations of Sterne, the sentimental
world was indebted for this practical manner of expressing adherence to
a sentimental creed.[3] In the _Hamburgischer Correspondent_ he
published an open letter to Gleim, dated April 4, 1769, about the time
of the inception of the “Winterreise,” in which letter he relates at
considerable length the origin of the idea.[4] A few days before this
the author was reading to his brother, Fritz Jacobi, the philosopher,
novelist and friend of Goethe, and a number of ladies, from Sterne’s
Sentimental Journey the story of the poor Franciscan who begged alms of
Yorick.“We read,” says Jacobi, “how Yorick used this snuff-box to
invoke its former possessor’s gentle, patient spirit, and to keep his
own composed in the midst of life’s conflicts.The good Monk had died:
Yorick sat by his grave, took out the little snuff-box, plucked a few
nettles from the head of the grave, and wept.We looked at one another
in silence: each rejoiced to find tears in the others’ eyes; we honored
the death of the venerable old man Lorenzo and the good-hearted
Englishman.In our opinion, too, the Franciscan deserved more to be
canonized than all the saints of the calendar.Gentleness, contentedness
with the world, patience invincible, pardon for the errors of mankind,
these are the primary virtues he teaches his disciples.” The moment was
too precious not to be emphasized by something rememberable, perceptible
to the senses, and they all purchased for themselves horn snuff-boxes,
and had the words “Pater Lorenzo” written in golden letters on the
outside of the cover and “Yorick” within.Oath was taken for the sake of
Saint Lorenzo to give something to every Franciscan who might ask of
them, and further: “If anyone in our company should allow himself to be
carried away by anger, his friend holds out to him the snuff-box, and we
have too much feeling to withstand this reminder even in the greatest
violence of passion.” It is suggested also that the ladies, who use no
tobacco, should at least have such a snuff-box on their night-stands,
because to them belong in such a high degree those gentle feelings which
were to be associated with the article.This letter printed in the Hamburg paper was to explain the snuff-box,
which Jacobi had sent to Gleim a few days before, and the desire is also
expressed to spread the order.Jacobi goes on to say: “Perhaps in the future, I may have the pleasure
of meeting a stranger here and there who will hand me the horn snuff-box
with its golden letters.I shall embrace him as intimately as one Free
Mason does another after the sign has been given.what a joy it
would be to me, if I could introduce so precious a custom among my
fellow-townsmen.” A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5]
sharply condemns Jacobi for his conceit in printing publicly a letter
meant for his friend or friends, and, to judge from the words with which
Jacobi accompanies the abridged form of the letter in the later editions
it would seem that Jacobi himself was later ashamed of the whole affair.The idea, however, was warmly received, and among the teary, sentimental
enthusiasts the horn snuff-box soon became the fad.A few days after the
publication of this letter, Wittenberg,[6] the journalist in Hamburg,
writes to Jacobi (April 21) that many in Hamburg desire to possess these
snuff-boxes, and he adds: “A hundred or so are now being manufactured;
besides the name Lorenzo, the following legend is to appear on the
cover: Animae quales non candidiores terra tulit.” Wittenberg explains
that this Latin motto was a suggestion of his own, selfishly made,
for thereby he might win the opportunity of explaining it to the fair
ladies, and exacting kisses for the service.Wittenberg asserts that a
lady (Longo guesses a certain Johanna Friederike Behrens) was the first
to suggest the manufacture of the article at Hamburg.A second letter[7]
from Wittenberg to Jacobi four months later (August 21, 1769) announces
the sending of nine snuff-boxes to Jacobi, and the price is given as
one-half a reichsthaler.Jacobi himself says in his note to the later
edition that merchants made a speculation out of the fad, and that a
multitude of such boxes were sent out through all Germany, even to
Denmark and Livonia: “they were in every hand,” he says.Graf Solms had
such boxes made of tin with the name Jacobi inside.Both Martin and
Werner instance the request[8] of a Protestant vicar, Johann David Goll
in Trossingen, for a “Lorenzodose” with the promise to subscribe to the
oath of the order, and, though Protestant, to name the Catholic
Franciscan his brother.According to a spicy review[9] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[10] these snuff-boxes were sold in
Hamburg wrapped in a printed copy of Jacobi’s letter to Gleim, and the
reviewer adds, “like Grenough’s tooth-tincture in the directions for its
use.”[11] Nicolai in “Sebaldus Nothanker” refers to the Lorenzo cult
with evident ridicule.[12]

There were other efforts to make Yorick’s example an efficient power of
beneficent brotherliness.Kaufmann attempted to found a Lorenzo order of
the horn snuff-box.Düntzer, in his study of Kaufmann,[13] states that
this was only an effort on Kaufmann’s part to embrace a timely
opportunity to make himself prominent.This endeavor was made according
to Düntzer, during Kaufmann’s residence in Strassburg, which the
investigator assigns to the years 1774-75.Leuchsenring,[14] the
eccentric sentimentalist, who for a time belonged to the Darmstadt
circle and whom Goethe satirized in “Pater Brey,” cherished also for a
time the idea of founding an order of “Empfindsamkeit.”

In the literary remains of Johann Christ Hofmann[15] in Coburg was found
the “patent” of an order of “Sanftmuth und Versöhnung.” A “Lorenzodose”
was found with it marked XXVIII, and the seven rules of the order, dated
Coburg “im Ordens-Comtoir, den 10 August, 1769,” are merely a topical
enlargement and ordering of Jacobi’s original idea.Appell states that Jacobi explained through a friend that he knew
nothing of this order and had no share in its founding.Longo complains
that Appell does not give the source of his information, but Jacobi in
his note to the so-called “Stiftungs-Brief” in the edition of 1807
quotes the article in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog” as his only knowledge
of this order, certainly implying his previous ignorance of its
existence.Somewhat akin to these attempts to incorporate Yorick’s ideas is the
fantastic laying out of the park at Marienwerder near Hanover, of which
Matthison writes in his “Vaterländische Besuche,”[16] and in a letter to
the Hofrath von Köpken in Magdeburg,[17] dated October 17, 1785.After a
sympathetic description of the secluded park, he tells how labyrinthine
paths lead to an eminence “where the unprepared stranger is surprised by
the sight of a cemetery.On the crosses there one reads beloved names
from Yorick’s Journey and Tristram Shandy.Father Lorenzo, Eliza, Maria
of Moulines, Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby and Yorick were gathered by a
poetic fancy to this graveyard.” The letter gives a similar description
and adds the epitaph on Trim’s monument, “Weed his grave clean, ye men
of goodness, for he was your brother,”[18] a quotation, which in its
fuller form, Matthison uses in a letter[19] to Bonstetten, Heidelberg,
February 7, 1794, in speaking of Böck the actor.It is impossible to
determine whose eccentric and tasteless enthusiasm is represented by
this mortuary arrangement.Louise von Ziegler, known in the Darmstadt circle as Lila, whom Merck
admired and, according to Caroline Flaschsland, “almost compared with
Yorick’s Maria,” was so sentimental that she had her grave made in her
garden, evidently for purposes of contemplation, and she led a lamb
about which ate and drank with her.Upon the death of this animal,
“a faithful dog” took its place.Thus was Maria of Moulines
remembered.[20]

It has already been noted that Yorick’s sympathy for the brute creation
found cordial response in Germany, such regard being accepted as a part
of his message.That the spread of such sentimental notions was not
confined to the printed word, but passed over into actual regulation of
conduct is admirably illustrated by an anecdote related in Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ in the January number for 1776, by a correspondent
who signs himself “S.” A friend was visiting him; they went to walk, and
the narrator having his gun with him shot with it two young doves.“What have the doves done to you?” he queries.“Nothing,” is the reply, “but they will taste good to you.” “But they
were alive,” interposed the friend, “and would have caressed
(geschnäbelt) one another,” and later he refuses to partake of the
doves.Connection with Yorick is established by the narrator himself:
“If my friend had not read Yorick’s story about the sparrow, he would
have had no rule of conduct here about shooting doves, and my doves
would have tasted better to him.” The influence of Yorick was, however,
quite possibly indirect through Jacobi as intermediary; for the latter
describes a sentimental family who refused to allow their doves to be
killed.The author of this letter, however, refers directly to Yorick,
to the very similar episode of the sparrows narrated in the continuation
of the Sentimental Journey, but an adventure original with the German
Bode.This is probably the source of Jacobi’s narrative.The other side of Yorick’s character, less comprehensible, less capable
of translation into tangibilities, was not disregarded.His humor and
whimsicality, though much less potent, were yet influential.Ramler said
in a letter to Gebler dated November 14, 1775, that everyone wished to
jest like Sterne,[21] and the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (October
31, 1775), at almost precisely the same time, discourses at some length
on the then prevailing epidemic of whimsicality, showing that
shallowness beheld in the then existing interest in humor a
justification for all sorts of eccentric behavior and inconsistent
wilfulness.Naturally Sterne’s influence in the world of letters may be traced most
obviously in the slavish imitation of his style, his sentiment, his
whims,--this phase represented in general by now forgotten triflers; but
it also enters into the thought of the great minds in the fatherland and
becomes interwoven with their culture.Their own expressions of
indebtedness are here often available in assigning a measure of
relationship.And finally along certain general lines the German Yorick
exercised an influence over the way men thought and wanted to think.The direct imitations of Sterne are very numerous, a crowd of followers,
a motley procession of would-be Yoricks, set out on one expedition or
another.Musäus[22] in a review of certain sentimental meanderings in
the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[23] remarked that the increase of
such journeyings threatened to bring about a new epoch in the taste of
the time.He adds that the good Yorick presumably never anticipated
becoming the founder of a fashionable sect.Other
expressions of alarm or disapprobation might be cited.Through Sterne’s influence the account of travels became more personal,
less purely topographical, more volatile and merry, more subjective.[24]
Goethe in a passage in the “Campagne in Frankreich,” to which reference
is made later, acknowledges this impulse as derived from Yorick.Its
presence was felt even when there was no outward effort at sentimental
journeying.The suggestion that the record of a journey was personal and
tinged with humor was essential to its popularity.It was probably
purely an effort to make use of this appeal which led the author of
“Bemerkungen eines Reisenden durch Deutschland, Frankreich, England und
Holland,”[25] a work of purely practical observation, to place upon his
title-page the alluring lines from Gay: “Life is a jest and all things
shew it.I thought so once, but now I know it;” a promise of humorous
attitude which does not find fulfilment in the heavy volumes of purely
objective description which follow.Probably the first German book to bear the name Yorick in its title was
a short satirical sketch entitled, “Yorick und die Bibliothek der
elenden Scribenten, an Hrn.--” 1768, 8vo (Anspach),[26] which is linked
to the quite disgustingly scurrilous Antikriticus controversy.Attempts at whimsicality, imitations also of the Shandean gallery of
originals appear, and the more particularly Shandean style of narration
is adopted in the novels of the period which deal with middle-class
domestic life.Of books directly inspired by Sterne, or following more
or less slavishly his guidance, a considerable proportion has
undoubtedly been consigned to merited oblivion.In many cases it is
possible to determine from contemporary reviews the nature of the
individual product, and the probable extent of indebtedness to the
British model.If it were possible to find and examine them all with a
view to establishing extent of relationship, the identity of motifs,
the borrowing of thought and sentiment, such a work would give us little
more than we learn from consideration of representative examples.In the
following chapter the attempt will be made to treat a number of typical
products.Baker in his article on Sterne in Germany adopts the rather
hazardous expedient of judging merely by title and taking from Goedeke’s
“Grundriss,” works which suggests a dependence on Sterne.[27]

The early relation of several great men of letters to Sterne has been
already treated in connection with the gradual awakening of Germany to
the new force.Wieland was one of Sterne’s most ardent admirers, one of
his most intelligent interpreters; but since his relationship to Sterne
has been made the theme of special study,[28] there will be needed here
but a brief recapitulation with some additional comment.Especially in
the productions of the years 1768-1774 are the direct allusions to
Sterne and his works numerous, the adaptations of motifs frequent, and
imitation of literary style unmistakable.Behmer finds no demonstrable
evidence of Sterne’s influence in Wieland’s work prior to two poems of
the year 1768, “Endymions Traum” and “Chloe;” but in the works of the
years immediately following there is abundant evidence both in style and
in subject matter, in the fund of allusion and illustration, to
establish the author’s indebtedness to Sterne.Behmer analyzes from this
standpoint the following works: “Beiträge zur geheimen Geschichte des
menschlichen Verstandes und Herzens;” “Sokrates Mainomenos oder die
Dialogen des Diogenes von Sinope;” “Der neue Amadis;” “Der goldene
Spiegel;” “Geschichte des Philosophen Danischmende;” “Gedanken über eine
alte Aufschrift;” “Geschichte der Abderiten.”[29]

In these works, but in different measure in each, Behmer finds Sterne
copied stylistically, in the constant conversations about the worth of
the book, the comparative value of the different chapters and the
difficulty of managing the material, in the fashion of inconsequence in
unexplained beginnings and abrupt endings, in the heaping up of words of
similar meaning, or similar ending, and in the frequent digressions.Sterne also is held responsible for the manner of introducing the
immorally suggestive, for the introduction of learned quotations and
references to authorities, for the sport made of the learned professions
and the satire upon all kinds of pedantry and overwrought enthusiasm.Though the direct, demonstrable influence of Sterne upon Wieland’s
literary activity dies out gradually[30] and naturally, with the growth
of his own genius, his admiration for the English favorite abides with
him, passing on into succeeding periods of his development, as his
former enthusiasm for Richardson failed to do.[31] More than twenty
years later, when more sober days had stilled the first unbridled
outburst of sentimentalism, Wieland speaks yet of Sterne in terms of
unaltered devotion: in an article published in the _Merkur_,[32] Sterne
is called among all authors the one “from whom I would last part,”[33]
and the subject of the article itself is an indication of his concern
for the fate of Yorick among his fellow-countrymen.It is in the form of
an epistle to Herr.zu D., and is a vigorous protest against
heedless imitation of Sterne, representing chiefly the perils of such
endeavor and the bathos of the failure.Wieland includes in the letter
some “specimen passages from a novel in the style of Tristram Shandy,”
which he asserts were sent him by the author.The quotations are almost
flat burlesque in their impossible idiocy, and one can easily appreciate
Wieland’s despairing cry with which the article ends.A few words of comment upon Behmer’s work will be in place.He accepts
as genuine the two added volumes of the Sentimental Journey and the
Koran, though he admits that the former were published by a friend, not
“without additions of his own,” and he uses these volumes directly at
least in one instance in establishing his parallels, the rescue of the
naked woman from the fire in the third volume of the Journey, and the
similar rescue from the waters in the “Nachlass des Diogenes.”[34] That
Sterne had any connection with these volumes is improbable, and the
Koran is surely a pure fabrication.Behmer seeks in a few words to deny
the reproach cast upon Sterne that he had no understanding of the
beauties of nature, but Behmer is certainly claiming too much when he
speaks of the “Farbenprächtige Schilderungen der ihm ungewohnten
sonnenverklärten Landschaft,” which Sterne gives us “repeatedly” in the
Sentimental Journey, and he finds his most secure evidence for Yorick’s
“genuine and pure” feeling for nature in the oft-quoted passage
beginning, “I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba and cry
‘’Tis all barren.’” It would surely be difficult to find these repeated
instances, for, in the whole work, Sterne gives absolutely no
description of natural scenery beyond the most casual, incidental
reference: the familiar passage is also misinterpreted, it betrays no
appreciation of inanimate nature in itself, and is but a cry in
condemnation of those who fail to find exercise for their sympathetic
emotions.Sterne mentions the “sweet myrtle” and “melancholy
cypress,”[35] not as indicative of his own affection for nature, but as
exemplifying his own exceeding personal need of expenditure of human
sympathy, as indeed the very limit to which sensibility can go, when the
desert denies possibility of human intercourse.Sterne’s attitude is
much better illustrated at the beginning of the “Road to Versailles”:
“As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for
in traveling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short
history of this self-same bird.” In other words, he met no possibility
for exercising the emotions.Behmer’s statement with reference to
Sterne, “that his authorship proceeds anyway from a parody of
Richardson,” is surely not demonstrable, nor that “this whole fashion of
composition is indeed but ridicule of Richardson.” Richardson’s star had
paled perceptibly before Sterne began to write, and the period of his
immense popularity lies nearly twenty years before.There is not the
slightest reason to suppose that his works have any connection
whatsoever with Richardson’s novels.One is tempted to think that Behmer
confuses Sterne with Fielding, whose career as a novelist did begin as a
parodist of the vain little printer.That the “Starling” in the
Sentimental Journey, which is passed on from hand to hand, and the
burden of government which wanders similarly in “Der Goldene Spiegel”
constitute a parallelism, as Behmer suggests (p.It could also be hardly demonstrated that what Behmer calls
“die Sternische Einführungsweise”[36] (p.54), as used in the
“Geschichte der Abderiten,” is peculiar to Sterne or even characteristic
of him.19) seems to be ignorant of any reprints or
translations of the Koran, the letters and the sermons, save those
coming from Switzerland.Bauer’s study of the Sterne-Wieland relation is much briefer
(thirty-five pages) and much less satisfactory because less thorough,
yet it contains some few valuable individual points and cited
parallelisms.Bauer errs in stating that Shandy appeared 1759-67 in
York, implying that the whole work was issued there.He gives the dates
of Sterne’s first visit to Paris, also incorrectly, as 1760-62.Finally, Wieland cannot be classed among the slavish imitators of
Yorick; he is too independent a thinker, too insistent a pedagogue to
allow himself to be led more than outwardly by the foreign model.He has
something of his own to say and is genuinely serious in a large portion
of his own philosophic speculations: hence, his connection with Sterne,
being largely stylistic and illustrative, may be designated as a drapery
of foreign humor about his own seriousness of theorizing.Wieland’s
Hellenic tendencies make the use of British humor all the more
incongruous.[37]

Herder’s early acquaintance with Sterne has been already treated.Subsequent writings offer also occasional indication of an abiding
admiration.Soon after his arrival in Paris he wrote to Hartknoch
praising Sterne’s characterization of the French people.[38] The fifth
“Wäldchen,” which is concerned with the laughable, contains reference to
Sterne.[39]

With Lessing the case is similar: a striking statement of personal
regard has been recorded, but Lessing’s literary work of the following
years does not betray a significant influence from Yorick.To be sure,
allusion is made to Sterne a few times in letters[40] and elsewhere,
but no direct manifestation of devotion is discoverable.The compelling
consciousness of his own message, his vigorous interest in deeper
problems of religion and philosophy, the then increasing worth of native
German literature, may well have overshadowed the influence of the
volatile Briton.Goethe’s expressions of admiration for Sterne and indebtedness to him
are familiar.Near the end of his life (December 16, 1828), when the
poet was interested in observing the history and sources of his own
culture, and was intent upon recording his own experience for the
edification and clarification of the people, he says in conversation
with Eckermann: “I am infinitely indebted to Shakespeare, Sterne and
Goldsmith.”[41] And a year later in a letter to Zelter,[42] (Weimar,
December 25, 1829), “The influence Goldsmith and Sterne exercised upon
me, just at the chief point of my development, cannot be estimated.This
high, benevolent irony, this just and comprehensive way of viewing
things, this gentleness to all opposition, this equanimity under every
change, and whatever else all the kindred virtues may be termed--such
things were a most admirable training for me, and surely, these are the
sentiments which in the end lead us back from all the mistaken paths of
life.”

In the same conversation with Eckermann from which the first quotation
is made, Goethe seems to defy the investigator who would endeavor to
define his indebtedness to Sterne, its nature and its measure.The
occasion was an attempt on the part of certain writers to determine the
authorship of certain distichs printed in both Schiller’s and Goethe’s
works.Upon a remark of Eckermann’s that this effort to hunt down a
man’s originality and to trace sources is very common in the literary
world, Goethe says: “Das ist sehr lächerlich, man könnte ebenso gut
einen wohlgenährten Mann nach den Ochsen, Schafen und Schweinen fragen,
die er gegessen und die ihm Kräfte gegeben.” An investigation such as
Goethe seems to warn us against here would be one of tremendous
difficulty, a theme for a separate work.It is purposed here to gather
only information with reference to Goethe’s expressed or implied
attitude toward Sterne, his opinion of the British master, and to note
certain connections between Goethe’s work and that of Sterne,
connections which are obvious or have been already a matter of comment
and discussion.In Strassburg under Herder’s[43] guidance, Goethe seems first to have
read the works of Sterne.His life in Frankfurt during the interval
between his two periods of university residence was not of a nature
calculated to increase his acquaintance with current literature, and his
studies did not lead to interest in literary novelty.This is his own
statement in “Dichtung und Wahrheit.”[44] That Herder’s enthusiasm for
Sterne was generous has already been shown by letters written in the few
years previous to his sojourn in Strassburg.Letters written to
Merck[45] (Strassburg, 1770-1771) would seem to show that then too
Sterne still stood high in his esteem.Whatever the exact time of
Goethe’s first acquaintance with Sterne, we know that he recommended the
British writer to Jung-Stilling for the latter’s cultivation in
letters.[46] Less than a year after Goethe’s departure from Strassburg,
we find him reading aloud to the Darmstadt circle the story of poor Le
Fevre from Tristram Shandy.This is reported in a letter, dated May 8,
1772, by Caroline Flachsland, Herder’s fiancée.[47] It is not evident
whether they read Sterne in the original or in the translation of
Zückert, the only one then available, unless possibly the reader gave a
translation as he read.Later in the same letter, Caroline mentions the
“Empfindsame Reisen,” possibly meaning Bode’s translation.She also
records reading Shakespeare in Wieland’s rendering, but as she speaks
later still of peeping into the English books which Herder had sent
Merck, it is a hazardous thing to reason from her mastery of English at
that time to the use of original or translation on the occasion of
Goethe’s reading.Contemporary criticism saw in the Martin of “Götz von Berlichingen”
a likeness to Sterne’s creations;[48] and in the other great work of the
pre-Weimarian period, in “Werther,” though no direct influence rewards
one’s search, one must acknowledge the presence of a mental and
emotional state to which Sterne was a contributor.Indeed Goethe himself
suggests this relationship.Speaking of “Werther” in the “Campagne in
Frankreich,”[49] he observes in a well-known passage that Werther did
not cause the disease, only exposed it, and that Yorick shared in
preparing the ground-work of sentimentalism on which “Werther” is built.According to the quarto edition of 1837, the first series of letters
from Switzerland dates from 1775, although they were not published till
1808, in the eleventh volume of the edition begun in 1806.Scherer,
in his “History of German Literature,” asserts that these letters are
written in imitation of Sterne, but it is difficult to see the occasion
for such a statement.The letters are, in spite of all haziness
concerning the time of their origin and Goethe’s exact purpose regarding
them,[50] a “fragment of Werther’s travels” and are confessedly cast in
a sentimental tone, which one might easily attribute to a Werther,
in whom hyperesthesia has not yet developed to delirium, an earlier
Werther.Yorick’s whim and sentiment are quite wanting, and the
sensuousness, especially as pertains to corporeal beauty, is distinctly
Goethean.Goethe’s accounts of his own travels are quite free from the Sterne
flavor; in fact he distinctly says that through the influence of the
Sentimental Journey all records of journeys had been mostly given up to
the feelings and opinions of the traveler, but that he, after his
Italian journey, had endeavored to keep himself objective.Robert Riemann in his study of Goethe’s novels,[52] calls Friedrich
in “Wilhelm Meister’s Lehrjahre” a representative of Sterne’s humor, and
he finds in Mittler in the “Wahlverwandtschaften” a union of seriousness
and the comic of caricature, reminiscent of Sterne and Hippel.Friedrich
is mercurial, petulant, utterly irresponsible, a creature of mirth and
laughter, subject to unreasoning fits of passion.One might, in thinking
of another character in fiction, designate Friedrich as faun-like.In
all of this one can, however, find little if any demonstrable likeness
to Sterne or Sterne’s creations.It is rather difficult also to see
wherein the character of Mittler is reminiscent of Sterne.Mittler is
introduced with the obvious purpose of representing certain opinions and
of aiding the development of the story by his insistence upon them.He
represents a brusque, practical kind of benevolence, and his
eccentricity lies only in the extraordinary occupation which he has
chosen for himself.Riemann also traces to Sterne, Fielding and their
German followers, Goethe’s occasional use of the direct appeal to the
reader.Doubtless Sterne’s example here was a force in extending this
rhetorical convention.It is claimed by Goebel[53] that Goethe’s “Homunculus,” suggested to the
master partly by reading of Paracelsus and partly by Sterne’s mediation,
is in some characteristics of his being dependent directly on Sterne’s
creation.In a meeting of the “Gesellschaft für deutsche Litteratur,”
November, 1896, Brandl expressed the opinion that Maria of Moulines was
a prototype of Mignon in “Wilhelm Meister.”[54]

The references to Sterne in Goethe’s works, in his letters and
conversations, are fairly numerous in the aggregate, but not especially
striking relatively.In the conversations with Eckermann there are
several other allusions besides those already mentioned.Goethe calls
Eckermann a second Shandy for suffering illness without calling a
physician, even as Walter Shandy failed to attend to the squeaking
door-hinge.[55] Eckermann himself draws on Sterne for illustrations in
Yorick’s description of Paris,[56] and on January 24, 1830, at a time
when we know that Goethe was re-reading Sterne, Eckermann refers to
Yorick’s (?)doctrine of the reasonable use of grief.[57] That Goethe
near the end of his life turned again to Sterne’s masterpiece is proved
by a letter to Zelter, October 5, 1830;[58] he adds here too that his
admiration has increased with the years, speaking particularly of
Sterne’s gay arraignment of pedantry and philistinism.But a few days
before this, October 1, 1830, in a conversation reported by Riemer,[59]
he expresses the same opinion and adds that Sterne was the first to
raise himself and us from pedantry and philistinism.By these remarks
Goethe commits himself in at least one respect to a favorable view of
Sterne’s influence on German letters.A few other minor allusions to
Sterne may be of interest.In an article in the _Horen_ (1795,
V. Stück,) entitled “Literarischer Sansculottismus,” Goethe mentions
Smelfungus as a type of growler.[60] In the “Wanderjahre”[61] there is a
reference to Yorick’s classification of travelers.Düntzer, in Schnorr’s
_Archiv_,[62] explains a passage in a letter of Goethe’s to Johanna
Fahlmer (August, 1775), “die Verworrenheiten des Diego und Juliens” as
an allusion to the “Intricacies of Diego and Julia” in Slawkenbergius’s
tale,[63] and to the traveler’s conversation with his beast.In a letter
to Frau von Stein[64] five years later (September 18, 1780) Goethe used
this same expression, and the editor of the letters avails himself of
Düntzer’s explanation.Düntzer further explains the word θεοδοκος,
used in Goethe’s Tagebuch with reference to the Duke, in connection with
the term θεοδιδακτος applied to Walter Shandy.The word is, however,
somewhat illegible in the manuscript.It was printed thus in the edition
of the Tagebuch published by Robert Keil, but when Düntzer himself, nine
years after the article in the _Archiv_, published an edition of the
Tagebücher he accepted a reading θεοτατος,[65] meaning, as he says, “ein
voller Gott,” thereby tacitly retracting his former theory of connection
with Sterne.The best known relationship between Goethe and Sterne is in connection
with the so-called plagiarisms in the appendix to the third volume of
the “Wanderjahre.” Here, in the second edition, were printed under the
title “Aus Makariens Archiv” various maxims and sentiments.Among these
were a number of sayings, reflections, axioms, which were later
discovered to have been taken bodily from the second part of the Koran,
the best known Sterne-forgery.Alfred Hédouin, in “Le Monde Maçonnique”
(1863), in an article “Goethe plagiaire de Sterne,” first located the
quotations.[66]

Mention has already been made of the account of Robert Springer, which
is probably the last published essay on the subject.It is entitled “Ist
Goethe ein Plagiarius Lorenz Sternes?” and is found in the volume
“Essays zur Kritik und Philosophie und zur Goethe-Litteratur.”[67]
Springer cites at some length the liberal opinions of Molière, La
Bruyère, Wieland, Heine and others concerning the literary appropriation
of another’s thought.He then proceeds to quote Goethe’s equally
generous views on the subject, and adds the uncritical fling that if
Goethe robbed Sterne, it was an honor to Sterne, a gain to his literary
fame.Near the end of his paper, Springer arrives at the question in
hand and states positively that these maxims, with their miscellaneous
companions, were never published by Goethe, but were found by the
editors of his literary remains among his miscellaneous papers, and then
issued in the ninth volume of the posthumous works.Hédouin had
suggested this possible explanation.Springer adds that the editors were
unaware of the source of this material and supposed it to be original
with Goethe.The facts of the case are, however, as follows: “Wilhelm Meister’s
Wanderjahre” was published first in 1821.[68] In 1829, a new and revised
edition was issued in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand.” Eckermann in his
conversations with Goethe[69] relates the circumstances under which the
appendices were added to the earlier work.When the book was in press,
the publisher discovered that of the three volumes planned, the last two
were going to be too thin, and begged for more material to fill out
their scantiness.In this perplexity Goethe brought to Eckermann two
packets of miscellaneous notes to be edited and added to those two
slender volumes.In this way arose the collection of sayings, scraps and
quotations “Im Sinne der Wanderer” and “Aus Makariens Archiv.” It was
later agreed that Eckermann, when Goethe’s literary remains should be
published, should place the matter elsewhere, ordered into logical
divisions of thought.All of the sentences here under special
consideration were published in the twenty-third volume of the “Ausgabe
letzter Hand,” which is dated 1830,[70] and are to be found there, on
pages 271-275 and 278-281.They are reprinted in the identical order in
the ninth volume of the “Nachgelassene Werke,” which also bore the
title, Vol.XLIX of “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” there found on pages 121-125
and 127-131.Evidently Springer found them here in the posthumous works,
and did not look for them in the previous volume, which was published
two years or thereabouts before Goethe’s death.Of the sentiments, sentences and quotations dealing with Sterne, there
are twenty which are translations from the Koran, in Loeper’s edition of
“Sprüche in Prosa,”[71] Nos.491-507 and 543-544; seventeen others (Nos.490, 508-509, 521-533, 535) contain direct appreciative criticism of
Sterne; No.538 is a comment upon a Latin quotation in the Koran and No.545 is a translation of another quotation in the same work.532
gives a quotation from Sterne, “Ich habe mein Elend nicht wie ein weiser
Mann benutzt,” which Loeper says he has been unable to find in any of
Sterne’s works.It is, however, in a letter[72] to John Hall Stevenson,
written probably in August, 1761.Loeper did not succeed in finding Nos.534, 536, 537, although their
position indicates that they were quotations from Sterne, but No.534 is
in a letter to Garrick from Paris, March 19, 1762.The German
translation however conveys a different impression from the original
English.The other two are not located; in spite of their position, the
way in which the book was put together would certainly allow for the
possibility of extraneous material creeping in.At their first
appearance in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” five Sprüche, Nos.491, 543,
534, 536, 537, were supplied with quotation marks, though the source was
not indicated.Thus it is seen that the most of the quotations were
published as original during Goethe’s lifetime, but he probably never
considered it of sufficient consequence to disavow their authorship in
public.It is quite possible that the way in which they were forced into
“Wilhelm Meister” was distasteful to him afterwards, and he did not care
to call attention to them.Goethe’s opinion of Sterne as expressed in the sentiments which
accompany the quotations from the Koran is significant.“Yorick Sterne,”
he says, “war der schönste Geist, der je gewirkt hat; wer ihn liest,
fühlet sich sogleich frei und schön; sein Humor ist unnachahmlich, und
nicht jeder Humor befreit die Seele” (490).“Sagacität und Penetration
sind bei ihm grenzenlos” (528).Goethe asserts here that every person of
culture should at that very time read Sterne’s works, so that the
nineteenth century might learn “what we owed him and perceive what we
might owe him.” Goethe took Sterne’s narrative of his journey as a
representation of an actual trip, or else he is speaking of Sterne’s
letters in the following:

“Seine Heiterkeit, Genügsamkeit, Duldsamkeit auf der Reise, wo diese
Eigenschaften am meisten geprüft werden, finden nicht leicht
Ihresgleichen” (No.529), and Goethe’s opinion of Sterne’s indecency is
characteristic of Goethe’s attitude.He says: “Das Element der
Lüsternheit, in dem er sich so zierlich und sinnig benimmt, würde vielen
Andern zum Verderben gereichen.”

The juxtaposition of these quotations and this appreciation of Sterne is
proof sufficient that Goethe considered Sterne the author of the Koran
at the time when the notes were made.At precisely what time this
occurred it is now impossible to determine, but the drift of the
comment, combined with our knowledge from sources already mentioned,
that Goethe turned again to Sterne in the latter years of his life,
would indicate that the quotations were made in the latter part of the
twenties, and that the re-reading of Sterne included the Koran.Since
the translations which Goethe gives are not identical with those in the
rendering ascribed to Bode (1778), Loeper suggests Goethe himself as the
translator of the individual quotations.Loeper is ignorant of the
earlier translation of Gellius, which Goethe may have used.[73]

There is yet another possibility of connection between Goethe and the
Koran.This work contained the story of the Graf von Gleichen, which is
acknowledged to have been a precursor of Goethe’s “Stella.” Düntzer in
his “Erläuterungen zu den deutschen Klassikern” says it is impossible to
determine whence Goethe took the story for “Stella.” He mentions that it
was contained in Bayle’s Dictionary, which is known to have been in
Goethe’s father’s library, and two other books, both dating from the
sixteenth century, are noted as possible sources.It seems rather more
probable that Goethe found the story in the Koran, which was published
but a few years before “Stella” was written and translated but a year
later, 1771, that is, but four years, or even less, before the
appearance of “Stella” (1775).[74]

Precisely in the spirit of the opinions quoted above is the little
essay[75] on Sterne which was published in the sixth volume of “Ueber
Kunst und Alterthum,” in which Goethe designates Sterne as a man “who
first stimulated and propagated the great epoch of purer knowledge of
humanity, noble toleration and tender love, in the second half of the
last century.” Goethe further calls attenion to Sterne’s disclosure of
human peculiarities (Eigenheiten), and the importance and interest of
these native, governing idiosyncrasies.A thorough
consideration of these problems, especially as concerns the cultural
indebtedness of Goethe to the English master would be a task demanding a
separate work.Goethe was an assimilator and summed up in himself the
spirit of a century, the attitude of predecessors and contemporaries.C. F. D. Schubart wrote a poem entitled “Yorick,”[76] beginning

  “Als Yorik starb, da flog
  Sein Seelchen auf den Himmel
  So leicht wie ein Seufzerchen.”

The angels ask him for news of earth, and the greater part of the poem
is occupied with his account of human fate.The relation is quite
characteristic of Schubart in its gruesomeness, its insistence upon
all-surrounding death and dissolution; but it contains no suggestion of
Sterne’s manner, or point of view.The only explanation of association
between the poem and its title is that Schubart shared the one-sided
German estimate of Sterne’s character and hence represented him as a
sympathetic messenger bringing to heaven on his death some tidings of
human weakness.In certain other manifestations, relatively subordinate, the German
literature of the latter part of the eighteenth century and the
beginning of the nineteenth and the life embodied therein are different
from what they would have been had it not been for Sterne’s example.Some of these secondary fruits of the Sterne cult have been mentioned
incidentally and exemplified in the foregoing pages.It would perhaps be
conducive to definiteness to gather them here.Sterne’s incontinuity of narration, the purposeful irrelation of parts,
the use of anecdote and episode, which to the stumbling reader reduce
his books to collections of disconnected essays and instances, gave to
German mediocrity a sanction to publish a mass of multifarious,
unrelated, and nondescript thought and incident.It is to be noted that
the spurious books such as the Koran, which Germany never clearly
sundered from the original, were direct examples in England of such
disjointed, patchwork books.Such a volume with a significant title is
“Mein Kontingent zur Modelectüre.”[77] Further, eccentricity in
typography, in outward form, may be largely attributed to Sterne’s
influence, although in individual cases no direct connection is
traceable.Thus, to the vagaries of Shandy is due probably the license
of the author of “Karl Blumenberg, eine tragisch-komische
Geschichte,”[78] who fills half pages with dashes and whole lines with
“Ha!Ha!”

As has been suggested already, Sterne’s example was potent in fostering
the use of such stylistic peculiarities, as the direct appeal to, and
conversation with the reader about the work, and its progress, and the
various features of the situation.It was in use by Sterne’s
predecessors in England and by their followers in Germany, before Sterne
can be said to have exercised any influence; for example, Hermes uses
the device constantly in “Miss Fanny Wilkes,” but Sterne undoubtedly
contributed largely to its popularity.One may perhaps trace to Sterne’s
blank pages and similar vagaries the eccentricity of the author of
“Ueber die Moralische Schönheit und Philosophie des Lebens,”[79] whose
eighth chapter is titled “Vom Stolz, eine Erzählung,” this title
occupying one page; the next page (210) is blank; the following page is
adorned with an urnlike decoration beneath which we read, “Es war einmal
ein Priester.” These three pages complete the chapter.The author of
“Dorset und Julie” (Leipzig, 1773-4) is also guilty of similar Yorickian
follies.[80]

Sterne’s ideas found approbation and currency apart from his general
message of the sentimental and humorous attitude toward the world and
its course.For example, the hobby-horse theory was warmly received, and
it became a permanent figure in Germany, often, and especially at first,
with playful reminder of Yorick’s use of the term.[81] Yorick’s
mock-scientific division of travelers seems to have met with especial
approval, and evidently became a part of conversational, and epistolary
commonplace allusion.Goethe in a letter to Marianne Willemer, November
9, 1830,[82] with direct reference to Sterne proposes for his son, then
traveling in Italy, the additional designation of the “bold” or
“complete” traveler.Carl August in a letter to Knebel,[83] dated
December 26, 1785, makes quite extended allusion to the classification.Lessing writes to Mendelssohn December 12, 1780: “The traveler whom you
sent to me a while ago was an inquisitive traveler.The one with whom I
now answer is an emigrating one.” The passage which follows is an
apology for thus adding to Yorick’s list.The two travelers were
respectively one Fliess and Alexander Daveson.[84] Nicolai makes similar
allusion to the “curious” traveler of Sterne’s classification near the
beginning of his “Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die
Schweiz im Jahre 1781.”[85]

Further search would increase the number of such allusions indefinitely.A few will be mentioned in the following chapter.One of Walter Shandy’s favorite contentions was the fortuitous
dependence of great events upon insignificant details.In his
philosophy, trifles were the determining factors of existence.The
adoption of this theory in Germany, as a principle in developing events
or character in fiction, is unquestionable in Wezel’s “Tobias Knaut,”
and elsewhere.The narrative, “Die Grosse Begebenheit aus kleinen
Ursachen” in the second volume of the _Erholungen_,[86] represents a
wholesale appropriation of the idea,--to be sure not new in Shandy, but
most strikingly exemplified there.In “Sebaldus Nothanker” the Revelation of St.John is a Sterne-like
hobby-horse and is so regarded by a reviewer in the _Magazin der
deutschen Critik_.[87] Schottenius in Knigge’s “Reise nach Braunschweig”
rides his hobby in the shape of his fifty-seven sermons.[88] Lessing
uses the Steckenpferd in a letter to Mendelssohn, November 5, 1768
(Lachmann edition, XII, p.212), and numerous other examples of direct
or indirect allusion might be cited.Sterne’s worn-out coin was a simile
adopted and felt to be pointed.[89]

Jacob Minor in a suggestive article in _Euphorion_,[90] entitled
“Wahrheit und Lüge auf dem Theater und in der Literatur,” expressed the
opinion that Sterne was instrumental in sharpening powers of observation
with reference to self-deception in little things, to all the deceiving
impulses of the human soul.It is held that through Sterne’s inspiration
Wieland and Goethe were rendered zealous to combat false ideals and
life-lies in greater things.It is maintained that Tieck also was
schooled in Sterne, and, by means of powers of observation sharpened in
this way, was enabled to portray the conscious or unconscious life-lie.[Footnote 1: A writer in the _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1775
    (II, 787 ff.), asserts that Sterne’s works are the favorite
    reading of the German nation.][Footnote 2: A further illustration may be found in the following
    discourse: “Von einigen Hindernissen des akademischen Fleisses.Eine Rede bey dem Anfange der öffentlichen Vorlesungen gehalten,”
    von J. C. C. Ferber, Professor zu Helmstädt (1773, 8vo), reviewed
    in _Magazin der deutschen Critik_, III, St.This
    academic guide of youth speaks of Sterne in the following words:
    “Wie tief dringt dieser Philosoph in die verborgensten Gänge des
    menschlichen Herzens, wie richtig entdeckt er die geheimsten
    Federn der Handlungen, wie entlarvt, wie verabscheuungsvoll steht
    vor ihm das Laster, wie liebenswürdig die Tugend!wie interessant
    sind seine Schilderungen, wie eindringend seine Lehren!und woher
    diese grosse Kenntniss des Menschen, woher diese getreue
    Bezeichnung der Natur, diese sanften Empfindungen, die seine
    geistvolle Sprache hervorbringt?Dieser Saame der Tugend, den er
    mit wohlthätiger Hand ausstreuet?” Yorick held up to college or
    university students as a champion of virtue is certainly an
    extraordinary spectacle.A critic in the _Frankfurter Gel.Anz._,
    August 18, 1772, in criticising the make-up of a so-called
    “Landbibliothek,” recommends books “die geschickt sind, die guten
    einfältigen, ungekünstelten Empfindungen reiner Seelen zu
    unterhalten, einen Yorick vor allen . . ..” The long article on
    Sterne’s character in the _Götting.84-92, 1780,
    “Etwas über Sterne: Schreiben an Prof.Lichtenberg” undoubtedly
    helped to establish this opinion of Sterne authoritatively.In it
    Sterne’s weaknesses are acknowledged, but the tendency is to
    emphasize the tender, sympathetic side of his character.The
    conception of Yorick there presented is quite different from the
    one held by Lichtenberg himself.][Footnote 3: The story of the “Lorenzodosen” is given quite fully
    in Longo’s monograph, “Laurence Sterne und Johann Georg Jacobi”
    (Wien, 1898, pp.39-44), and the sketch given here is based upon
    his investigation, with consultation of the sources there cited.Nothing new is likely to be added to his account, but because of
    its important illustrative bearing on the whole story of Sterne in
    Germany, a fairly complete account is given here.Longo refers to
    the following as literature on the subject:

    connection with Sterne.For example, he gives Gellius’s “Yoricks

    and hence in no way an example of German imitation; he gives also
    Schummel’s “Fritzens Reise nach Dessau” (1776) and “Reise nach
    Schlesien” (1792), Nonne’s “Amors Reisen nach Fockzana zum
    Friedenscongress” (1773), none of which has anything to do with
    Sterne.“Trim oder der Sieg der Liebe über die Philosophie”
    (Leipzig, 1776), by Ludw.v. Hopffgarten, also cited by
    Baker, undoubtedly owes its name only to Sterne.See _Jenaische
    Zeitungen von gel.deutsche
    Bibl._, XXXIV, 2, p.484; similarly “Lottchens Reise ins
    Zuchthaus” by Kirtsten, 1777, is given in Baker’s list, but the
    work “Reise” is evidently used here only in a figurative sense,
    the story being but the relation of character deterioration,
    a downward journey toward the titular place of punishment.See
    _Jenaische Zeitungen von gel.; 1778,
    p. 12.deutsche Bibl._, XXXV, 1, p. 182.Baker gives Bock’s
    “Tagereise” and “Geschichte eines empfundenen Tages” as if they
    were two different books.He further states: “Sterne is the parent
    of a long list of German Sentimental Journeys which began with von
    Thümmel’s ‘Reise in die mittäglichen Provinzen Frankreichs.’” This
    work really belongs comparatively late in the story of imitations.Two of Knigge’s books are also included.[Footnote 28: “Laurence Sterne und C. M. Wieland, von Karl August
    Behmer, Forschungen zur neueren Litteraturgeschichte IX.München,
    1899.Ein Beitrag zur Erforschung fremder Einflüsse auf Wieland’s

    briefer study of this connection: a Programm by F. Bauer, “Ueber
    den Einfluss, Laurence Sternes auf Chr.M. Wieland,” Karlsbad,
    1898.A. Mager published, 1890, at Marburg, “Wieland’s Nachlass
    des Diogenes von Sinope und das englische Vorbild,” a school
    “Abhandlung,” which dealt with a connection between this work of
    Wieland and Sterne.Wood (“Einfluss Fieldings auf die deutsche
    Litteratur,” Yokohama, 1895) finds constant imitation of Sterne in
    “Don Silvio,” which, from Behmer’s proof concerning the dates of
    Wieland’s acquaintance with Sterne, can hardly be possible.][Footnote 29: Some other works are mentioned as containing
    references and allusions.][Footnote 30: In “Oberon” alone of Wieland’s later works does
    Behmer discover Sterne’s influence and there no longer in the
    style, but in the adaptation of motif.][Footnote 31: See Erich Schmidt’s “Richardson, Rousseau und

    expressions of adoration in the whole epoch of Sterne’s
    popularity.][Footnote 34: Since Germany did not sharply separate the work of
    Sterne from his continuator, this is, of course, to be classed

    a review of a Swedish book in the _Teutscher Merkur_, 1782, II,

IMITATORS OF STERNE


Among the disciples of Sterne in Germany whose literary imitation may be
regarded as typical of their master’s influence, Johann Georg Jacobi is
perhaps the best known.His relation to the famous “Lorenzodosen”
conceit is sufficient to link his name with that of Yorick.Martin[1]
asserts that he was called “Uncle Toby” in Gleim’s circle because of his
enthusiasm for Sterne.The indebtedness of Jacobi to Sterne is the
subject of a special study by Dr.Joseph Longo, “Laurence Sterne und
Johann Georg Jacobi;” and the period of Jacobi’s literary work which
falls under the spell of Yorick has also been treated in an inaugural
dissertation, “Ueber Johann Georg Jacobi’s Jugendwerke,” by Georg
Ransohoff.The detail of Jacobi’s indebtedness to Sterne is to be found
in these two works.Longo was unable to settle definitely the date of Jacobi’s first
acquaintance with Sterne.The first mention made of him is in the letter
to Gleim of April 4, 1769, and a few days afterward,--April 10,--the
intelligence is afforded that he himself is working on a “journey.” The
“Winterreise” was published at Düsseldorf in the middle of June, 1769.Externally the work seems more under the influence of the French
wanderer Chapelle, since prose and verse are used irregularly
alternating, a style quite different from the English model.There are
short and unnumbered chapters, as in the Sentimental Journey, but,
unlike Sterne, Jacobi, with one exception, names no places and makes no
attempt at description of place or people, other than the sentimental
individuals encountered on the way.He makes no analysis of national, or
even local characteristics: the journey, in short, is almost completely
without place-influence.There is in the volume much more exuberance of
fancy, grotesque at times, a more conscious exercise of the picturing
imagination than we find in Sterne.There is use, too, of mythological
figures quite foreign to Sterne, an obvious reminiscence of Jacobi’s
Anacreontic experience.He exaggerates Yorick’s sentimentalism, is more
weepy, more tender, more sympathizing; yet, as Longo does not
sufficiently emphasize, he does not touch the whimsical side of Yorick’s
work.Jacobi, unlike his model, but in common with other German
imitators, is insistent in instruction and serious in contention for pet
theories, as is exemplified by the discussion of the doctrine of
immortality.There are opinions to be maintained, there is a message to
be delivered.Jacobi in this does not give the lie to his nationality.Like other German imitators, too, he took up with especial feeling the
relations between man and the animal world, an attitude to be connected
with several familiar episodes in Sterne.[2] The two chapters, “Der
Heerd” and “Der Taubenschlag,” tell of a sentimental farmer who mourns
over the fact that his son has cut down a tree in which the nightingale
was wont to nest.A similar sentimental regard is cherished in this
family for the doves, which no one killed, because no one could eat
them.Even as Yorick meets a Franciscan, Jacobi encounters a Jesuit
whose heart leaps to meet his own, and later, after the real journey is
done, a visit to a lonely cloister gives opportunity for converse with a
monk, like Pater Lorenzo,--tender, simple and humane.The “Sommerreise,” according to Longo, appeared in the latter part of
September, 1769, a less important work, which, in the edition of 1807,
Jacobi considered unworthy of preservation.Imitation of Sterne is
marked: following a criticism by Wieland the author attempts to be
humorous, but with dubious success; he introduces a Sterne-like
sentimental character which had not been used in the “Winterreise,”
a beggar-soldier, and he repeats the motif of human sympathy for animals
in the story of the lamb.Sympathy with erring womanhood is expressed in
the incidents related in “Die Fischerhütte” and “Der Geistliche.” These
two books were confessedly inspired by Yorick, and contemporary
criticism treated them as Yorick products.The _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_, published by Jacobi’s friend Klotz, would
naturally favor the volumes.Its review of the “Winterreise” is
non-critical and chiefly remarkable for the denial of foreign imitation.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[3] in reviewing the same work pays
a significant tribute to Sterne, praising his power of disclosing the
good and beautiful in the seemingly commonplace.In direct criticism of
the book, the reviewer calls it a journey of fancy, the work of a
youthful poet rather than that of a sensitive philosopher.Wieland is
credited with the astounding opinion that he prefers the “Sommerreise”
to Yorick’s journey.[4] Longo’s characterization of Sterne is in the
main satisfactory, yet there is distinctly traceable the tendency to
ignore or minimize the whimsical elements of Sterne’s work: this is the
natural result of his approach to Sterne, through Jacobi, who understood
only the sentimentalism of the English master.[5]

Among the works of sentiment which were acknowledged imitations of
Yorick, along with Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” probably the most typical and
best known was the “Empfindsame Reisen durch Deutschland” by Johann
Gottlieb Schummel.Its importance as a document in the history of
sentimentalism is rather as an example of tendency than as a force
contributing materially to the spread of the movement.Its influence was
probably not great, though one reviewer does hint at a following.[6] Yet
the book has been remembered more persistently than any other work of
its genre, except Jacobi’s works, undoubtedly in part because it was
superior to many of its kind, partly, also, because its author won later
and maintained a position of some eminence, as a writer and a pedagogue;
but largely because Goethe’s well-known review of it in the _Frankfurter
Gelehrte Anzeigen_ has been cited as a remarkably acute contribution to
the discriminating criticism of the genuine and the affected in the
eighteenth-century literature of feeling, and has drawn attention from
the very fact of its source to the object of its criticism.Schummel was born in May, 1748, and hence was but twenty years of age
when Germany began to thrill in response to Yorick’s sentiments.It is
probable that the first volume was written while Schummel was still a
university student in 1768-1770.He assumed a position as teacher in
1771, but the first volume came out at Easter of that year; this would
probably throw its composition back into the year before.The second
volume appeared at Michaelmas of the same year.His publisher was
Zimmermann at Wittenberg and Zerbst, and the first volume at any rate
was issued in a new edition.The third volume came out in the spring of
1772.[7] Schummel’s title, “Empfindsame Reisen,” is, of course, taken
from the newly coined word in Bode’s title, but in face of this fact it
is rather remarkable to find that several quotations from Sterne’s
Journey, given in the course of the work, are from the Mittelstedt
translation.On two occasions, indeed, Schummel uses the title of the
Mittelstedt rendering as first published, “Versuch über die menschliche
Natur.”[8]

These facts lead one to believe that Schummel drew his inspiration from
the reading of this translation.This is interesting in connection with
Böttiger’s claim that the whole cavalcade of sentimental travelers who
trotted along after Yorick with all sorts of animals and vehicles was a
proof of the excellence and power of Bode’s translation.As one would
naturally infer from the title of Schummel’s fiction, the Sentimental
Journey is more constantly drawn upon as a source of ideas, motifs,
expression, and method, than Tristram Shandy, but the allusions to
Sterne’s earlier book, and the direct adaptations from it are both
numerous and generous.This fact has not been recognized by the critics,
and is not an easy inference from the contemporary reviews.The book is the result of an immediate impulse to imitation felt
irresistibly on the reading of Sterne’s narrative.That the critics and
readers of that day treated with serious consideration the efforts of a
callow youth of twenty or twenty-one in this direction is indicative
either of comparative vigor of execution, or of prepossession of the
critical world in favor of the literary genre,--doubtless of both.Schummel confesses that the desire to write came directly after the book
had been read.“I had just finished reading it,” he says, “and Heaven
knows with what pleasure, every word from ‘as far as this matter is
concerned’ on to ‘I seized the hand of the lady’s maid,’ were imprinted
in my soul with small invisible letters.” The characters of the Journey
stood “life-size in his very soul.” Involuntarily his inventive powers
had sketched several plans for a continuation, releasing Yorick from the
hand of the _fille de chambre_.But what he attempts is not a
continuation but a German parallel.In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its
argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey:
the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English
model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the
incidents are quite slavishly copied.A complete summary of the thread
of incident on which the various sentimental adventures, whimsical
speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with: it is only
necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a model can
be established.Schummel’s narrative is often for many successive pages
absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any attempt at
Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment.At the
pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling.A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the
appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of
imitation, and the nature of the method.In outward form the Sentimental
Journey is copied.The volume is not divided into chapters, but there
are named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of
section-headings.Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to
strike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: “Is he dead, the old
cousin?” are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on
receipt of the news, and in Yorick fashion he calls for guesses
concerning the mien with which the words were said.The conversation of
the various human passions with Yorick concerning the advisability of
offering the lady in Calais a seat in his chaise is here directly
imitated in the questions put by avarice, vanity, etc., concerning the
cousin’s death.The actual journey does not begin until page 97, a brief
autobiography of the hero occupying the first part of the book; this
inconsequence is confessedly intended to be a Tristram Shandy whim.[9]
The author’s relation to his parents is adapted directly from Shandy,
since he here possesses an incapable, unpractical, philosophizing
father, who determines upon methods for the superior education of his
son; and a simple, silly mockery of a mother.Left, however, an orphan, he begins his sentimental adventures: thrust
on the world he falls in with a kindly baker’s wife whose conduct toward
him brings tears to the eyes of the ten-year old lad, this showing his
early appetite for sentimental journeying.A large part of this first
section relating to his early life and youthful struggles, his kindly
benefactor, his adventure with Potiphar’s wife, is simple and direct,
with only an occasional hint of Yorick’s influence in word or phrase, as
if the author, now and then, recalled the purpose and the inspiration.For example, not until near the bottom of page 30 does it occur to him
to be abrupt and indulge in Shandean eccentricities, and then again,
after a few lines, he resumes the natural order of discourse.And again,
on page 83, he breaks off into attempted frivolity and Yorick
whimsicality of narration.In starting out upon his journey the author
says: “I will tread in Yorick’s foot-prints, what matters it if I do not
fill them out?My heart is not so broad as his, the sooner can it be
filled; my head is not so sound; my brain not so regularly formed.My
eyes are not so clear, but for that he was born in England and I in
Germany; he is a man and I am but a youth, in short, he is Yorick and I
am not Yorick.” He determines to journey where it is most sentimental
and passes the various lands in review in making his decision.Having
fastened upon Germany, he questions himself similarly with reference to
the cities.Yorick’s love of lists, of mock-serious discrimination, of
inconsequential reasonings is here copied.The call upon epic, tragic,
lyric poets, musicians, etc., which follows here is a further imitation
of Yorick’s list-making and pseudo-scientific method.On his way to Leipzig, in the post-chaise, the author falls in with a
clergyman: the manner of this meeting is intended to be Sterne-like:
Schummel sighs, the companion remarks, “You too are an unhappy one,” and
they join hands while the human heart beams in the traveler’s eyes.But, apart from these external incidents of their
meeting, the matter of their converse is in no way inspired by Sterne.It joins itself with the narrative of the author’s visit to a church in
a village by the wayside, and deals in general with the nature of the
clergyman’s relation to his people and the general mediocrity and
ineptitude of the average homiletical discourse, the failure of
clergymen to relate their pulpit utterance to the life of the common
Christian,--all of which is genuine, sane and original, undoubtedly a
real protest on the part of Schummel, the pedagogue, against a
prevailing abuse of his time and other times.This section represents
unquestionably the earnest convictions of its author, and is written
with professional zeal.This division is followed by an evidently
purposeful return to Sterne’s eccentricity of manner.The author begins
a division of his narrative, “Der zerbrochene Postwagen,” which is
probably meant to coincide with the post-chaise accident in Shandy’s
travels, writes a few lines in it, then begins the section again,
something like the interrupted story of the King of Bohemia and his
Seven Castles.Then follows an abrupt discursive study of his aptitudes
and proclivities, interspersed with Latin exclamations, interrogation
points and dashes.“What a parenthesis is that!” he cries, and a few
lines further on, “I burn with longing to begin a parenthesis again.” On
his arrival in Leipzig, Schummel imitates closely Sterne’s satirical
guide-book description of Calais[10] in his brief account of the city,
breaking off abruptly like Sterne, and roundly berating all
“Reisebeschreiber.” Here in fitting contrast with this superficial
enumeration of facts stands his brief traveler’s creed, an interest in
people rather than in places, all of which is derived from Sterne’s
chapter, “In the Street, Calais,” in which the master discloses the
sentimental possibilities of traveling and typifies the superficial,
unemotional wanderer in the persons of Smelfungus and Mundungus, and
from the familiar passage in “The Passport, Versailles,” beginning, “But
I could wish to spy out the nakedness, etc.” No sooner is he arrived in
Leipzig, than he accomplishes a sentimental rescue of an unfortunate
woman on the street.In the expression of her immediate needs, Schummel
indulges for the first time in a row of stars, with the obvious
intention of raising a low suggestion, which he contradicts with
mock-innocent questionings a few lines later, thereby fastening the
attention on the possibility of vulgar interpretation.Sterne is guilty
of this device in numerous instances in both his works, and the English
continuation of the Sentimental Journey relies upon it in greater and
more revolting measure.Once established in his hotel, the author betakes himself to the
theater: this very act he feels will bring upon him the censure of the
critics, for Yorick went to the theater too.“A merchant’s boy went
along before me,” he says in naïve defense, “was he also an imitator of
Yorick?” On the way he meets a fair maid-in-waiting, and the relation
between her and the traveler, developed here and later, is inspired
directly by Yorick’s connection with the fair _fille de chambre_.Schummel imitates Sterne’s excessive detail of description, devoting a
whole paragraph to his manner of removing his hat before a lady whom he
encounters on this walk to the theater.This was another phase of
Sterne’s pseudo-scientific method: he describes the trivial with the
attitude of the trained observer, registering minutely the detail of
phenomena, a mock-parade of scholarship illustrated by his description
of Trim’s attitude while reading his sermon, or the dropping of the hat
in the kitchen during the memorable scene when the news of Bobby’s death
is brought.In Schummel’s narration of his adventures in the house of ill-repute
there are numerous sentimental excrescences in his conduct with the poor
prisoner there, due largely to Yorick’s pattern, such as their weeping
on one another’s breast, and his wiping away her tears and his, drawn
from Yorick’s amiable service for Maria of Moulines, an act seemingly
expressing the most refined human sympathy.The remaining events of this
first volume include an unexpected meeting with the kind baker’s wife,
which takes place at Gellert’s grave.Yorick’s imitators were especially
fond of re-introducing a sentimental relationship.Yorick led the way in
his renewed acquaintance with the _fille de chambre_; Stevenson in his
continuation went to extremes in exploiting this cheap device.Other motifs derived from Sterne, less integral, may be briefly
summarized.From the Sentimental Journey is taken the motif that
valuable or interesting papers be used to wrap ordinary articles of
trade: here herring are wrapped in fragments of the father’s philosophy;
in the Sentimental Journey we find a similar degrading use for the
“Fragment.” Schummel breaks off the chapter “La Naïve,”[11] under the
Sternesque subterfuge of having to deliver manuscript to an insistent
publisher.Yorick writes his preface to the Journey in the
“Désobligeant,” that is, in the midst of the narrative itself.Schummel
modifies the eccentricity merely by placing his foreword at the end of
the volume.The value of it, he says, will repay the reader for waiting
so long,--a statement which finds little justification in the preface
itself.It begins, “Auweh!Diable, mein
Rücken, mein Fuss!” and so on for half a page,--a pitiful effort to
follow the English master’s wilful and skilful incoherence.The
following pages, however, once this outbreak is at an end, contain a
modicum of sense, the feeble, apologetic explanation of his desire in
imitating Yorick, given in forethought of the critics’ condemnation.Similarly the position of the dedication is unusual, in the midst of the
volume, even as the dedication of Shandy was roguishly delayed.The
dedication itself, however, is not an imitation of Sterne’s clever
satire, but, addressed to Yorick himself, is a striking example of
burning personal devotion and over-wrought praise.Schummel hopes[12] in
Sterne fashion to write a chapter on “Vorübergeben,” or in the chapter
“Das Komödienhaus” (pp.185-210) to write a digression on “Walking
behind a maid.” Like Sterne, he writes in praise of digressions.[13] In
imitation of Sterne is conceived the digressive speculation concerning
the door through which at the beginning of the book he is cast into the
rude world.Among further expressions savoring of Sterne, may be
mentioned a “Centner of curses” (p.39), a “Quentchen of curses,” and
the analytical description of a tone of voice as one-fourth questioning,
five-eighths entreating and one-eighth commanding (p. 229).The direct allusions to Sterne and his works are numerous.A list of
Sterne characters which were indelibly impressed upon his mind is found
near the very beginning (pp.3-4); other allusions are to M. Dessein
(p.65), La Fleur’s “Courierstiefel” (p.115), the words of the dying
Yorick (p.128), the pococurantism of Mrs.187), the division
of travelers into types (p.200), Yorick’s
violin-playing (p.274), the foolish fat scullion (p.290), Yorick’s
description of a maid’s (p.188) eyes, “als ob sie zwischen vier Wänden
einem Garaus machen könnten.”

The second volume is even more incoherent in narration, and contains
less genuine occurrence and more ill-considered attempts at
whimsicality, yet throughout this volume there are indications that the
author is awakening to the vulnerability of his position, and this is in
no other particular more easily discernible than in the half-hearted
defiance of the critics and his anticipation of their censure.The
change, so extraordinary in the third volume, is foreshadowed in the
second.Purely sentimental, effusive, and abundantly teary is the story
of the rescued baker’s wife.In this excess of sentiment, Schummel shows
his intellectual appreciation of Sterne’s individual treatment of the
humane and pathetic, for near the end of the poor woman’s narrative the
author seems to recollect a fundamental sentence of Sterne’s creed, the
inevitable admixture of the whimsical, and here he introduces into the
sentimental relation a Shandean idiosyncrasy: from page 43 the narrative
leaps back to the beginning of the volume, and Schummel advises the
reader to turn back and re-read, referring incidentally to his confused
fashion of narration.The awkwardness with which this is done proves
Schummel’s inability to follow Yorick, though its use shows his
appreciation of Sterne’s peculiar genius.The visit of the author, the
baker’s wife and her daughter (the former lady’s maid) to the graveyard
is Yorickian in flavor, and the plucking of nettles from the grave of
the dead epileptic is a direct borrowing.Attempts to be immorally,
sensuously suggestive in the manner of Sterne are found in the so-called
chapter on “Button-holes,” here cast in a more Shandean vein, and in the
adventure “die ängstliche Nacht,”--in the latter case resembling more
the less frank, more insinuating method of the Sentimental Journey.The
sentimental attitude toward man’s dumb companions is imitated in his
adventure with the house-dog; the author fears the barking of this
animal may disturb the sleep of the poor baker’s wife: he beats the dog
into silence, then grows remorseful and wishes “that I had given him no
blow,” or that the dog might at least give him back the blows.His
thought that the dog might be pretending its pain, he designates a
subtle subterfuge of his troubled conscience, and Goethe, in the review
mentioned above, exclaims, “A fine pendant to Yorick’s scene with the
Monk.”

Distinctly Shandean are the numerous digressions, as on imitation
(p.16), on authors and fairs (p.226-238)
“ein ganz originelles Gemische von Wiz, Belesenheit, Scharfsinn,
gesunder Philosophie, Erfahrung, Algebra und Mechanik,” or (p.253) “Von
der Entstehungsart eines Buches nach Erfindung der Buchdrukerkunst,”
which in reference to Sterne’s phrase, is called a “jungfräuliche
Materie.” He promises (pp.75 and 108), like Sterne, to write numerous
chapters on extraordinary subjects,--indeed, he announces his intention
of supplementing the missing sections of Shandy on “Button-holes” and on
the “Right and Left (sic) end of a Woman.” His own promised effusions
are to be “Ueber die roten und schwarzen Röcke,” “über die Verbindung
der Theologie mit Schwarz,” “Europäischenfrauenzimmerschuhabsätze,” half
a one “Ueber die Schuhsohlen” and “Ueber meinen Namen.”

His additions to Shandy are flat and witless, that on the “Right and
Wrong End of a Woman” (pp.degenerating into three brief
narratives displaying woman’s susceptibility to flattery, the whole idea
probably adapted from Sterne’s chapter, “An Act of Charity;” the chapter
on “Button-holes” is made a part of the general narrative of his
relation to his “Naïve.” Weakly whimsical is his seeking pardon for the
discourse with which the Frenchman (pp.62-66), under the pretext that
it belonged somewhere else and had inadvertently crept in.Shandean also
is the black margin to pages 199-206, the line upside down (p.175),
the twelve irregularly printed lines (p.331), inserted to indicate his
efforts in writing with a burned hand, the lines of dashes and
exclamation points, the mathematical, financial calculation of the worth
of his book from various points of view, and the description of the
maiden’s walk (p. 291).Sterne’s mock-scientific method, as already
noted, is observable again in the statement of the position of the
dagger “at an angle of 30°” (p. 248).His coining of new words, for
which he is censured by the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, is also a
legacy of Yorick’s method.The third volume bears little relation to Sterne aside from its title,
and one can only wonder, in view of the criticism of the two parts
already published and the nature of the author’s own partial revulsion
of feeling, that he did not give up publishing it altogether, or choose
another title, and sunder the work entirely from the foregoing volumes,
with which it has in fact so contradictory a connection.It may be that
his relations to the publisher demanded the issuing of the third part
under the same title.This volume is easily divisible into several distinct parts, which are
linked with one another, and to the preceding narrative, only by a
conventional thread of introduction.These comprise: the story of
Caroline and Rosenfeld, a typical eighteenth century tale of love,
seduction and flight; the hosts’ ballad, “Es war einmahl ein Edelmann;”
the play, “Die unschuldige Ehebrecherin” and “Mein Tagebuch,” the
journal of an honest preacher, and a further sincere exploitation of
Schummel’s ideas upon the clergyman’s office, his ideal of simplicity,
kindliness, and humanity.In the latter part of the book Schummel
resumes his original narrative, and indulges once more in the luxury of
sentimental adventure, but without the former abortive attempts at
imitating Sterne’s peculiarities of diction.This last resumption of the
sentimental creed introduces to us one event evidently inspired by
Yorick: he meets a poor, maimed soldier-beggar.Since misfortune has
deprived the narrator himself of his possessions, he can give nothing
and goes a begging for the beggar’s sake, introducing the new and highly
sentimental idea of “vicarious begging” (pp.In the following
episode, a visit to a child-murderess, Schummel leaves a page entirely
blank as an appropriate proof of incapacity to express his emotions
attendant on the execution of the unfortunate.Sterne also left a page
blank for the description of the Widow Wadman’s charms.At the very end of the book Schummel drops his narrative altogether and
discourses upon his own work.It would be difficult to find in any
literature so complete a condemnation of one’s own serious and extensive
endeavor, so candid a criticism of one’s own work, so frank an
acknowledgment of the pettiness of one’s achievement.He says his work,
as an imitation of Sterne’s two novels, has “few or absolutely no
beauties of the original, and many faults of its own.” He states that
his enthusiasm for Tristram has been somewhat dampened by Sonnenfels and
Riedel; he sees now faults which should not have been imitated; the
frivolous attitude of the narrator toward his father and mother is
deprecated, and the suggestion is given that this feature was derived
from Tristram’s own frankness concerning the eccentricities and
incapacities of his parents.He begs reference to a passage in the
second volume[14] where the author alludes with warmth of appreciation
to his real father and mother; that is, genuine regard overcame the
temporary blindness, real affection arose and thrust out the transitory
inclination to an alien whimsicality.Schummel admits that he has utterly failed in his effort to characterize
the German people in the way Sterne treated the English and French; he
confesses that the ninety-page autobiography which precedes the journey
itself was intended to be Tristram-like, but openly stigmatizes his own
failure as “ill conceived, incoherent and not very well told!” After
mentioning some few incidents and passages in this first section which
he regards as passable, he boldly condemns the rest as “almost beneath
all criticism,” and the same words are used with reference to much that
follows, in which he confesses to imitation, bad taste and intolerable
indelicacy.He calls his pathetic attempts at whimsical mannerisms
(Heideldum, etc.), “kläglich, überaus kläglich,” expresses the opinion
that one would not be surprised at the reader who would throw away the
whole book at such a passage.The words of the preacher in the two
sections where he is allowed to air his opinions still meet with his
approval, and the same is true of one or two other sections.In
conclusion, he states that the first part contains hardly one hundred
good pages, and that the second part is worse than the first, so that he
is unwilling to look at it again and seek out its faults.The absence of
allusions to Sterne’s writings is marked, except in the critical section
at the end, he mentions Sterne but once (p.239), where he calls him
“schnurrigt.” This alteration of feeling must have taken place in a
brief space of time, for the third volume is signed April 25, 1772.It
is not easy to establish with probability the works of Sonnenfels and
Riedel which are credited with a share in this revulsion of feeling.In all of this Schummel is a discriminating critic of his own work; he
is also discerning in his assertion that the narrative contained in his
volume is conceived more in the vein of Fielding and Richardson.The
Sterne elements are rather embroidered on to the other fabric, or, as he
himself says, using another figure, “only fried in Shandy fat.”[15]

Goethe’s criticism of the second volume, already alluded to, is found in
the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ in the issue of March 3, 1772.The
nature of the review is familiar: Goethe calls the book a thistle which
he has found on Yorick’s grave.“Alles,” he says, “hat es dem guten
Yorick geraubt, Speer, Helm und Lanze, nur Schade!inwendig steckt der
Herr Präceptor S. zu Magdeburg.Yorick empfand, und dieser setzt
sich hin zu empfinden.Yorick wird von seiner Laune ergriffen, und
weinte und lachte in einer Minute und durch die Magie der Sympathie
lachen und weinen wir mit: hier aber steht einer und überlegt: wie lache
und weine ich?was werden die Leute sagen, wenn ich lache und weine?”
etc.Schummel is stigmatized as a childish imitator and his book is
censured as “beneath criticism,” oddly enough the very judgment its own
author accords but a few weeks later on the completion of the third
volume.The review contains several citations illustrative of Schummel’s
style.The first two parts were reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek_.[16] The length of the review is testimony to the interest
in the book, and the tone of the article, though frankly unfavorable,
is not so emphatically censorious as the one first noted.It is observed
that Schummel has attempted the impossible,--the adoption of another’s
“Laune,” and hence his failure.The reviewer notes, often with generous
quotations, the more noticeable, direct imitations from Sterne, the
conversation of the emotions, the nettle-plucking at the grave, the
eccentric orthography and the new-coined words.Several passages of
comment or comparison testify to the then current admiration of Yorick,
and the conventional German interpretation of his character; “sein
gutes, empfindungsvolles Herz, mit Tugend und sittlichem Gefühl
erfüllt.” The review is signed “Sr:”[17]

A critic in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ for January
17, 1772, treating the first two volumes, expresses the opinion that
Jacobi, the author of the “Tagereise,” and Schummel have little but the
title from Yorick.The author’s seeking for opportunity to dissolve in
emotion is contrasted unfavorably with Yorick’s method, the affected
style is condemned, yet it is admitted that the work promises better
things from its talented author; his power of observation and his good
heart are not to be unacknowledged.The severity of the review is
directed against the imitators already arising.The _Magazin der deutschen Critik_[18] reviews the third volume with
favorable comment; the comedy which Schummel saw fit to insert is
received with rather extraordinary praise, and the author is urged to
continue work in the drama; a desire is expressed even for a fourth
part.The _Hamburgische Neue Zeitung_, June 4 and October 29, 1771,
places Schummel unhesitatingly beside the English master, calls him as
original as his pattern, to Sterne belongs the honor only of the
invention.The author is hailed as a genius whose talents should be
supported, so that Germany would not have to envy England her
Yorick.[19]

After Schummel’s remarkable self-chastisement, one could hardly expect
to find in his subsequent works evidence of Sterne’s influence, save as
unconsciously a dimmed admiration might exert a certain force.Probably
contemporaneous with the composition of the third volume of the work,
but possibly earlier, Schummel wrote the fourth part of a ponderous
novel by a fellow Silesian, Christian Opitz, entitled “Die Gleichheit
der menschlichen Herzen, bey der Ungleichheit ihrer äusserlichen
Umstände in der Geschichte Herrn Redlichs und seiner Bedienten.” Goedeke
implies that Opitz was the author of all but the last part, but the
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[20] maintains that each
part has a different author, and quotes the preface to the fourth as
substantiation.According to this review both the second and fourth
parts are characterized by a humorous fashion in writing, and the last
is praised as being the best of the four.It seems probable that
Schummel’s enthusiasm for Sterne played its part in the composition of
this work.Possibly encouraged by the critic’s approbation, Schummel devoted his
literary effort for the following years largely to the drama.In 1774 he
published his “Uebersetzer-Bibliothek zum Gebrauche der Uebersetzer,
Schulmänner und Liebhaber der alten Litteratur.” The reviewer[21] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ finds passages in this book in which
the author of the “Empfindsame Reisen” is visible,--where his fancy runs
away with his reason,--and a passage is quoted in which reference is
made to Slawkenberg’s book on noses.It would seem that the seeking for
wit survived the crude sentimentality.Two years later Schummel published “Fritzen’s Reise nach Dessau,”[22]
a work composed of letters from a twelve-year old boy, written on a
journey from Magdeburg to Dessau.The letters are quite without whim or
sentiment, and the book has been remembered for the extended description
of Basedow’s experimental school, “Philantropin” (opened in 1774).Its
account has been the source of the information given of this endeavor in
some pedagogical treatises[23] and it was re-issued, as a document in
the history of pedagogical experiment, in Leipzig, by Albert Richter in
1891.About fifteen years later still the “Reise durch Schlesien”[24]
was issued.It is a simple narrative of a real journey with description
of places and people, frankly personal, almost epistolary in form,
without a suggestion of Sterne-like whim or sentiment.One passage is
significant as indicating the author’s realization of his change of
attitude.The sight of a group of prisoners bound by a chain calls to
his memory his former sentimental extravagance, and he exclaims: “Twenty
years ago, when I was still a sentimental traveler, I would have wasted
many an ‘Oh’ and ‘alas’ over this scene; at present, since I have
learned to know the world and mankind somewhat more intimately, I think
otherwise.”

Johann Christian Bock (1724-1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet of the
Ackerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the
production of “Die Tagereise,” which was published at Leipzig in 1770.The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title “Die Geschichte eines
empfundenen Tages.”[25] The only change in the new edition was the
addition of a number of copperplate engravings.The book is inspired in
part by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary
Jacobi.Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean
influence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey.In
outward form the book resembles Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” since verse is
introduced to vary the prose narrative.The attitude of the author
toward his journey, undertaken with conscious purpose, is characteristic
of the whole set of emotional sentiment-seekers, who found in their
Yorick a challenge to go and do likewise: “Everybody is journeying,
I thought, and took Yorick and Jacobi with me.I will really see
whether I too may not chance upon a _fille de chambre_ or a
harvest-maid,” is a very significant statement of his inspiration and
intention.Once started on his journey, the author falls in with a poor
warrior-beggar, an adaptation of Sterne’s Chevalier de St.Louis,[26]
and he puts in verse Yorick’s expressed sentiment that the king and the
fatherland should not allow the faithful soldier to fall into such
distress.Bock’s next sentimental adventure is with a fair peasant-maid whom he
sees weeping by the wayside.Through Yorick-like insistence of sympathy,
he finally wins from her information concerning the tender situation:
a stern stepfather, an unwelcome suitor of his choosing, and a lover of
her own.Her inability to write and thus communicate with the latter is
the immediate cause of the present overflow.The traveler beholds in
this predicament a remarkable sentimental opportunity and offers his
services; he strokes her cheek, her tears are dried, and they part like
brother and sister.The episode is unquestionably inspired by the
episode of Maria of Moulines; in the latter development of the affair,
the sentiment, which is expressed, that the girl’s innocence is her own
defense is borrowed directly from Yorick’s statement concerning the
_fille de chambre_.[27] The traveler’s questioning of his own motives in
“Die Ueberlegung”[28] is distinctly Sterne-like, and it demonstrates
also Bock’s appreciation of this quizzical element in Yorick’s attitude
toward his own sentimental behavior.The relation of man to the domestic
animals is treated sentimentally in the episode of the old beggar and
his dead dog:[29] the tears of the beggar, his affection for the beast,
their genuine comradeship, and the dog’s devotion after the world had
forsaken his master, are all part and parcel of that fantastic humane
movement which has its source in Yorick’s dead ass.Bock practically
confesses his inspiration by direct allusion to the episode in Yorick.Bock defends with warmth the old peasant and his grief.The wanderer’s acquaintance with the lady’s companion[30] is adapted
from Yorick’s _fille de chambre_ connection, and Bock cannot avoid a
fleshly suggestion, distinctly in the style of Yorick in the section,
the “Spider.”[31] The return journey in the sentimental moonlight
affords the author another opportunity for the exercise of his broad
human sympathy: he meets a poor woman, a day-laborer with her child,
gives them a few coins and doubts whether king or bishop could be more
content with the benediction of the apostolic chair than he with the
blessing of this unfortunate,--a sentiment derived from Yorick’s
overcolored veneration for the horn snuff-box.The churchyard scene with which the journey ends is more openly
fanciful, down-right visionary in tone, but the manner is very
emphatically not that of Sterne, though in the midst the Sterne motif of
nettle-plucking is introduced.This sentimental episode took hold of
German imagination with peculiar force.The hobby-horse idea also was
sure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.[32]

But apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the
foreign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is
genuine and original: the author’s German patriotism, his praise of the
old days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled “Die Gaststube,” his
“Trinklied eines Deutschen,” his disquisition on the position of the
poet in the world (“ein eignes Kapitel”), and his adulation of Gellert
at the latter’s grave.The reviewer in the _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_[33] chides the unnamed, youthful author for not
allowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for being led on
by Jacobi’s success to hasten his exercises into print.In reality Bock
was no longer youthful (forty-six) when the “Tagereise” was published.The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_ for 1771, calls the book “an
unsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,” and wishes that this
“Rhapsodie von Cruditäten” might be the last one thrust on the market as
a “Sentimental Journey.” The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[34]
comments also on the double inspiration, and the insufficiency and
tiresomeness of the performance.And yet Boie[35] says the papers
praised the little book; for himself, however, he observes, he little
desires to read it, and adds “What will our Yoricks yet come to?At last
they will get pretty insignificant, I think, if they keep on this way.”

Bock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the
early seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1) Empfindsame
Reise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick
angestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771--really published at the end of
the previous year; (2) . . .am Ostertage, 1772; (3) Am Pfingsttage,
1772; (4) Am Johannistage, 1773; (5) Am Weynachtstage, 1773.These books
were issued anonymously, and Schröder’s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3)
under Bock’s name, but there seems no good reason to doubt his
authorship of them all.Indeed, his claim to (1) is, according to the
_Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the
“Tagereise” in the introduction, and by the initials signed.None of
them are given by Goedeke.The books are evidently only in a general way
dependent on the Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all
sorts of subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some
relation to the festival in which they appear.In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that the
title only is derived from Yorick,[36] and states that he was forced to
this misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but
“Empfindsame Reisen.” It is also to be noted that the description
beneath the title, “von einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,” is omitted
after the first volume.The review of (4) and (5) in the _Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter_ finds this a commendable resumption of proper
humility.The observations are evidently loosely strung together without
the pretense of a narrative, such as “Allgemeines Perspectiv durch alle
Visitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines
Weisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschlüsse, Empfindsame Art sein
Geld gut unterzubringen,” etc.[37] An obvious purpose inspires the
writer, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the meditations
are distinctly religious.That some of the observations had a local
significance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental tendency
there, may account for the warm reception by the _Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent_.[38]

Some contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias Claudius
and Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of mental
and emotional fibre is suggested.No one claimed an influence working
from the English master.Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm Röseler in his
introductory poem to a study of “Matthias Claudius und sein Humor”[39]
calls Asmus, “Deutschland’s Yorick,” thereby agreeing almost verbally
with the German correspondent of the _Deutsches Museum_, who wrote from
London nearly a hundred years before, September 14, 1778, “Asmus.is the German Sterne,” an assertion which was denied by a later
correspondent, who asserts that Claudius’s manner is very different from
that of Sterne.[40]

August von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on
Sterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, “Die Geschichte
meines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.”[41] The
influence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story:
he commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and
grandmother, and the circumstances of his father’s birth.The
grandfather is an original undoubtedly modeled on lines suggested by
Sterne’s hobby-horse idea.He had been chosen in days gone by to greet
the reigning prince on the latter’s return from a journey, and the old
man harks back to this circumstance with “hobby-horsical” persistence,
whatever the subject of conversation, even as all matters led Uncle Toby
to military fortification, and the elder Shandy to one of his pet
theories.In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed.When the
news comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man
discuss multifarious and irrelevant topics in a fashion reminiscent of
the conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while similar events
are going on above.Later in the book we have long lists, or catalogues
of things which resemble one of Sterne’s favorite mannerisms.But the
greater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far removed from its
inception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a gallery of
originals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.Göschen’s “Reise von Johann”[42] is a product of the late renascence of
sentimental journeying.Master and servant are represented in this book
as traveling through southern Germany, a pair as closely related in head
and heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain Shandy and Corporal Trim.The style is of rather forced buoyancy and sprightliness, with
intentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt at humor of
narration, which is choked by characteristic national desire to convey
information, and a fatal propensity to description of places,[43] even
when some satirical purpose underlies the account, as in the description
of Erlangen and its university.The servant Johann has mild adventures
with the maids in the various inns, which are reminiscent of Yorick,
and in one case it borders on the openly suggestive and more Shandean
method.[44] A distinctly borrowed motif is the accidental finding of
papers which contain matters of interest.This is twice resorted to;
a former occupant of the room in the inn in Nürnberg had left valuable
notes of travel; and Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on
self-destruction, takes from her a box with papers, disclosing a
revolting story, baldly told.German mediocrity, imitating Yorick in
this regard, and failing of his delicacy and subtlety, brought forth
hideous offspring.An attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in
the “Furth Catechismus in Frage und Antwort” (pp.71-74), and genuinely
sentimental adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp.70-71)
and the village funeral (pp.This book is classed by Ebeling[45] without sufficient reason as an
imitation of von Thümmel.This statement is probably derived from the
letter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following
lines.Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,
December 29, 1795.[46] The abundance of material for the Xenien project
is commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list of
vulnerable possibilities we read: “Thümmel, Göschen als sein
Stallmeister--” a collocation of names easily attributable, in
consideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature
of their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author
on another,[47] or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the fact
that Göschen was von Thümmel’s publisher.Nor is there anything in the
correspondence to justify Ebeling’s harshness in saying concerning this
volume of Göschen, that it “enjoyed the honor of being ridiculed
(verhöhnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.”
Goethe replies (December 30), in approval, and exclaims, “How fine
Charis and Johann will appear beside one another.”[48] The suggestion
concerning a possible use of Göschen’s book in the Xenien was never
carried out.It will be remembered that Göschen submitted the manuscript of his book
to Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement
“that he had laughed heartily at some of the whims.[49]” Garve, in a
letter dated March 8, 1875, speaks of Göschen’s book in terms of
moderate praise.[50]

The “Empfindsame Reise von Oldenburg nach Bremen,”[51] the author of
which was a Hanoverian army officer, H. J. C. Hedemann, is characterized
by Ebeling as emphatically not inspired by Sterne.[52] Although it is
not a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and Bock conceived it,
and is thus not an example of the earliest period of imitation, and
although it contains no passages of teary sentimentality in attitude
toward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all connection with
Sterne’s manner.It would seem as if, having outgrown the earlier
Yorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human brotherhood,
perhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution, certain would-be
men of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as through a glass
darkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in lumbering,
Teutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of sentimentalism, and
to build success for their wares on remembrance of a defaced idol.This
view of later sentimental journeying is practically acknowledged at any
rate in a contemporary review, the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ for
August 22, 1796, which remarks: “A sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet,
wo einige bekannte Sachen und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz
heben sollen.”[53]

Hedemann’s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is
openly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.His endeavor is markedly in Sterne’s manner in his attitude toward the
writing of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing
the material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the
various parts of the book.Quite in Sterne’s fashion, and to be
associated with Sterne’s frequent promises of chapters, and statements
concerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination “to
mention some things beforehand about which I don’t know anything to
say,” and his rather humorous enumeration of them.The author satirizes
the real sentimental traveler of Sterne’s earlier imitators in the
following passage (second chapter):

“It really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,
if no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is
surely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be
managed with strict economy.If one leaps over the most interesting
events entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at
least of not filling many pages.”

Likewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the
satirical purpose is evident.He has not gone far on his journey when he
is met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines
that there is a “Schlagbaum” in the way.After the children have opened
the barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little
coin, concludes, as a “sentimental traveler,” to give it to the other
sex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct.He
reflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,--all of
which is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to trivial
acts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past conduct,
which was copied by Sterne’s imitators from numerous instances in the
works of Yorick.Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in which
he beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a paper
throne; and of particular significance here is the explanation that the
whole company who do “erhabene Dummheit” honor formerly lived in cities
of the kingdom, but “now they are on journeys.” Further examples of a
humorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it would be a
“great error” to write an account of a journey without weaving in an
anecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all duties of such
a traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to accomplish it, and his
formal declaration: “I, the undersigned, do vow and make promise to be
in love before twenty-four hours are past.” The story with which his
volume closes, “Das Ständchen,” is rather entertaining and is told
graphically, easily, without whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian
_double entendre_.[54]

Another work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning
shade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole
remaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the
“Empfindsame Reise nach Schilda” (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo.von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_
(1794, I, p.416) as a free revision of an old popular tale, “Das
lustige und lächerliche Lalenburg.” The book is evidently without
sentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and joke combined with
caricature and half-serious tilting against unimportant literary
celebrities.[55]

Certain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously connected
with Sterne may be grouped together here.To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous product,
“Zween Tage eines Schwindsüchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,” von L. . . .(Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the sentiment is “not
entirely like Yorick’s,” and the _Altonaer Reichs-Postreuter_ (July 2,
1772) adds that “not at all like Yorick’s” would have been nearer the
truth.This book is mentioned by Hillebrand with implication that it is
the extreme example of the absurd sentimental tendency, probably judging
merely from the title,[56] for the book is doubtless merely thoughtful,
contemplative, with a minimum of overwrought feeling.According to the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (1775, pp.592-3),
another product of the earlier seventies, the “Leben und Schicksale des
Martin Dickius,” by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many places a clever
imitation of Sterne,[57] although the author claims, like Wezel in
“Tobias Knaut,” not to have read Shandy until after the book was
written.Surely the digression on noses which the author allows himself
is suspicious.Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which reference
has been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent criticism as
an imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel “Beyträge zur Geschichte
des teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,”[58] although the general
tenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance, seemed to promise a
more independent, a more competent and felicitous performance.Kurz
expresses this opinion, which may have been derived from criticisms in
the eighteenth century journals.The _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,
July 28, 1775, does not, however, take this view; but seems to be in the
novel a genuine exemplification of the author’s theories as previously
expressed.[59] The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[60] calls the book
didactic, a tract against certain essentially German follies.Merck, in
the _Teutscher Merkur_,[61] says the imitation of Sterne is quite too
obvious, though Blankenburg denies it.Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,
belongs undoubtedly “Die Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont” (1773),
the author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was
translated or Jacobi published.He says he is not worthy to pack
Yorick’s bag or weave Jacobi’s arbor,[62] but the review of the
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ evidently regards it as a product,
nevertheless, of Yorick’s impulse.Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau
la Roche[63] says that the “Empfindsamkeit” of Rosalie in the first part
of “Rosaliens Briefe” is derived from Yorick.The “Leben, Thaten und
Meynungen des D. J. Pet.Menadie” (Halle, 1777-1781) is charged by the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ with attempt at Shandy-like
eccentricity of narrative and love of digression.[64]

One little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick’s spell, is worthy
of particular mention because at its time it received from the reviewers
a more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file of
Sentimental Journeys.It is “M . . ..” by E. A. A. von Göchhausen
(1740-1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed
worthy of several later editions.Its dependence on Sterne is confessed
and obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes
defiantly.The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both
in outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness
dwindles away steadily as the book advances.Göchhausen, as other
imitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously
now and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to
say, a message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to
follow his model.The absurd title stands, of course, for “Meine Reisen” and the puerile
abbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were intended to be
a Sterne-like jest, a pitiful one.Why Goedeke should suggest “Meine
Randglossen” is quite inexplicable, since Göchhausen himself in the very
first chapter indicates the real title.Beneath the enigmatical title
stands an alleged quotation from Shandy: “Ein Autor borgt, bettelt und
stiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey meiner Seele!die Originalität
fast so rar geworden ist als die Ehrlichkeit.”[65] The book itself, like
Sterne’s Journey, is divided into brief chapters unnumbered but named.As the author loses Yorick from sight, the chapters grow longer.Göchhausen has availed himself of an odd device to disarm
criticism,--a plan used once or twice by Schummel: occasionally when the
imitation is obvious, he repudiates the charge sarcastically, or
anticipates with irony the critics’ censure.For example, he gives
directions to his servant Pumper to pack for the journey; a reader
exclaims, “a portmanteau, Mr.Author, so that everything, even to that,
shall be just like Yorick,” and in the following passage the author
quarrels with the critics who allow no one to travel with a portmanteau,
because an English clergyman traveled with one.Pumper’s
misunderstanding of this objection is used as a farther ridicule of the
critics.When on the journey, the author converses with two poor
wandering monks, whose conversation, at any rate, is a witness to their
content, the whole being a legacy of the Lorenzo episode, and the author
entitles the chapter: “The members of the religious order, or, as some
critics will call it, a wretchedly unsuccessful imitation.” In the next
chapter, “Der Visitator” (pp.in which the author encounters
customs annoyances, the critic is again allowed to complain that
everything is stolen from Yorick, a protest which is answered by the
author quite naïvely, “Yorick journeyed, ate, drank; I do too.” In “Die
Pause” the author stands before the inn door and fancies that a number
of spies (Ausspäher) stand there waiting for him; he protests that
Yorick encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a very different
sort of folk.On page 253 he exclaims, “für diesen schreibe ich dieses
Kapitel nicht und ich--beklage ihn!” Here a footnote suggests “Das
übrige des Diebstahls vid.Yorick’s Gefangenen.” Similarly when he calls
his servant his “La Fleur,” he converses with the critics about his
theft from Yorick.The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about the
name of the book.The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the motto, is
clinched by reference to this quotation in the section “Apologie,” and
by the following chapter, which is entitled “Yorick.” The latter is the
most unequivocal and, withal, the most successful imitation of Yorick’s
manner which the volume offers.The author is sitting on a sofa reading
the Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such a trip is awakened in him.Someone knocks and the door is opened by the postman, as the narrator is
opening his “Lorenzodose,” and the story of the poor monk is touching
his heart now for the twentieth time as strongly as ever.The postman
asks postage on the letter as well as his own trivial fee.The author
counts over money, miscounts it, then in counting forgets all about it,
puts the money away and continues the reading of Yorick.The postman
interrupts him; the author grows impatient and says, “You want four
groschen?” and is inexplicably vexed at the honesty of the man who says
it is only three pfennigs for himself and the four groschen for the
post.Here is a direct following of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules
his behavior toward an inferior, who is modest in his request.After the
incident, his spite, his head and his heart and his “ich” converse in
true Sterne fashion as to the advisability of his beginning to read
Yorick again.He reasons with himself concerning his conduct toward the
postman, then in an apostrophe to Yorick he condemns himself for failing
in this little test.This conversation occupies so much time that he
cannot run after the postman, but he resolves that nothing, not even the
fly that lights on his nose, shall bring him so far as to forget
wherefore his friend J . . . .sent him a “Lorenzodose.” And at the end
of the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,
disclosing the letters of the word “Yorick.” The “Lorenzodose” is
mentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by
opening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the
treasure.[66]

Following this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to “My dear
J . . .,” who, at the author’s request, had sent him on June 29th a
“Lorenzodose.” Jacobi’s accompanying words are given.The author
acknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the self-conquest
demanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been won.Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the volume
contains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment.The servant Pumper
is a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the dewdrops from
the blades of grass.Cast in the real Yorick mould is the scene in which
Pumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master’s expostulation that
God created the little beast also, Pumper is touched, wipes the blood
off with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness, indulging in a
pathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick’s ass episode.Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator’s conduct
toward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author asserts that
he has never eaten a roll, put on a white shirt, traveled in a
comfortable carriage, or been borne by a strong horse, without bemoaning
those who were less fortunately circumstanced.A similar and truly
Sterne-like triumph of feeling over convention is the traveler’s
insistence that Pumper shall ride with him inside the coach; seemingly a
point derived from Jacobi’s failure to be equally democratic.[67]

Sterne’s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially
his distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his
material is here imitated.For example: near the close of a chapter the
author summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title
“Der Brief” and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says
the latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced
in the following one.Yet with Yorick’s inconsequence, the narrator is
led aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, “But where is
Pumper?” with the answer, “Heaven and my readers know, it was to no
purpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last
one to which the title will be just as appropriate)”, and the next
chapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning “As to whether Pumper
will appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I am not really
sure myself.”

The whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the
author’s reasoning with him, a Sterne device, is employed so constantly
in the book as to become a wearying mannerism.Examples have already
been cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is devoted
to such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later the
reader objects to the narrator’s drinking coffee without giving a
chapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what
the chapter is going to be because of the author’s leap; the reader
guesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions
in the moon.The chapter “Der Einwurf” is occupied entirely with the
reader’s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of
fancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the
book; here the author discloses himself.[68] Sterne-like whim is found
in the chapter “Die Nacht,” which consists of a single sentence: “Ich
schenke Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig
verschlafen.” Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the
chapter entitled “Der Monolog,” which consists of four lines of dots,
and the question, “Didn’t you think all this too, my readers?”
Typographical eccentricity is observed also in the arrangement of the
conversation of the ladies A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter.Like Sterne, our author makes lists of things; probably inspired by
Yorick’s apostrophe to the “Sensorium” is our traveler’s appeal to the
spring of joy.The description of the fashion of walking observed in the
maid in the moon is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel’s
journey.Göchhausen’s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is
considerable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers;
his stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.The literary journals accepted Göchhausen’s work as a Yorick imitation,
condemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the book worthy
of their praise.[69]

Probably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure the
style of Tristram Shandy is Wezel’s once famous “Tobias Knaut,” the
“Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt,
aus Familiennachrichten gesammelt.”[70] In this work the influence of
Fielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne.The historians of
literature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of
the period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge
of human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.[71] They
unite also in the opinion that “Tobias Knaut” places Wezel in the ranks
of Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in
part the novel must be regarded as a satire on “Empfindsamkeit” and
hence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne’s
dominion, especially to the distinctively German Sterne.That this
impulse, which later became the guiding principle of “Wilhelmine Arend,”
was already strong in “Tobias Knaut” is hinted at by Gervinus, but
passed over in silence by other writers.Kurz, following Wieland, who
reviewed the novel in his _Merkur_, finds that the influence of Sterne
was baneful.Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as
obscuring and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents
of the author.[72]

A brief investigation of Wezel’s novel will easily demonstrate his
indebtedness to Sterne.Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the
charge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when “Tobias”
was begun.Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes
Tristram at some length.[73] This inconsistency is occasion for censure
on the part of the reviewers.Wezel’s story begins, like Shandy, “ab ovo,” and, in resemblance to
Sterne’s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child
before its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.The work is episodical and
digressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in
Sterne’s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the
personality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family
of originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne.This
is not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely
extraneous in event, and nature of interest.The story of the new-found
son, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for
its connection with the Knaut family is very remote.This very story,
interpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page
digression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the
author states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of
his “Lateinische Pneumatologie,”--a genuine Sternian pretense, reminding
one of the “Tristrapaedia.” Whimsicality of manner distinctly
reminiscent of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or
lists of things, as in Chapter III, “Deduktionen, Dissertationen,
Argumentationen a priori und a posteriori,” and so on; plainly adapted
from Sterne’s idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large
red letters occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of
the second volume, which reads as follows: “Dienst-freundliche Anzeige.Jedermann, der an ernsten Gesprächen keinen Gefallen findet, wird
freundschaftlich ersucht alle folgende Blätter, deren Inhalt einem
Gespräche ähnlich sieht, wohlbedächtig zu überschlagen, d.h.von dieser
Anzeige an gerechnet.Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich vom 22.Absatze fahren können,--Cuique Suum.” The following page is blank: this
is closely akin to Sterne’s vagaries.Like Sterne, he makes promise of
chapter-subject.[74] Similarly dependent on Sterne’s example, is the
Fragment in Chapter VIII, Volume III, which breaks off suddenly under
the plea that the rest could not be found.Like Sterne, our author
satirizes detailed description in the excessive account of the
infinitesimals of personal discomfort after a carouse.[75] He makes also
obscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by typographical eccentricities
(I, p. 153).To be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets
is the humor “Man leuterirte, appelirte--irte,--irte,--irte.”

The author’s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are
sketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,--for example, the
beginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the difficulties
of chronicling what has happened during the preceding learned
disquisition.When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse, this is
accompanied by the sighs of the author, a really audible one being put
in a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative style for which
Sterne must be held responsible.Similar to this is the author’s
statement (Chap.II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope, Wieland and
all the rest could not unite the characteristics which had just been
predicated of Selmann.Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the reader
about the way of telling the story, indulging[76] in a mock-serious line
of reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes.Further conversation
with the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in Volume I,
and in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, “Wake up, ladies and
gentlemen,” and continues at some length a conversation with these
fancied personages about the progress of the book.Wezel in a few cases
adopted the worst feature of Sterne’s work and was guilty of bad taste
in precisely Yorick’s style: Tobias’s adventure with the so-called
soldier’s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but
the following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in
the pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding.Sterne’s indecent
suggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the
Original’s aversion to women.A similar censure could be spoken
regarding the adventure in the tavern,[77] where the author hesitates on
the edge of grossness.Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the
accidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the
“Original,” left behind in the hotel, played their rôle in the tale.The treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an
imitation of Yorick’s famous visit in the rural cottage.A parallel to
Walter Shandy’s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles is
found in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance suggested
the sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias’s inability to take
off his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy’s future
life.This is a reminder of Tristram’s obliquity in his manner of
setting up his top.As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the
location of the soul.The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick
and the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to
chastise the thirst for “originals” and overwrought sentimentalism.His
generosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick.As a boy he
would empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life
was one round of Shandean speculation, largely about the relationships
of trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating his
motives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.Wezel’s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the
account of the “Original” (Chap.II), who was cold when
others were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was
not full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host
because it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a
woman.Selmann longs to meet such an original.Selmann also thinks he
has found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with
“Nein,” greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that
this was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage
over Selmann himself.So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias
ride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to
be merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental
friend.Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two
maidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and
write a lament over its demise.In jest, too, it is said that the
Captain made a “sentimental journey through the stables.” The author
converses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,
a convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal.The novelist
makes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed making a
long citation from a learned Chinese book.An expression suggesting
Sterne is the oath taken “bey den Nachthemden aller Musen,”[78] and an
intentional inconsequence of narration, giving occasion to conversation
regarding the author’s control of his work, is the sudden passing over
of the six years which Tobias spent in Selmann’s house.[79]

In connection with Wezel’s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products in
Germany, it is interesting to consider his poem: “Die unvermuthete
Nachbarschaft.Ein Gespräch,” which was the second in a volume of three
poems entitled “Epistel an die deutschen Dichter,” the name of the first
poem, and published in Leipzig in 1775.This slight work is written for
the most part in couplets and covers twenty-three pages.Wezel
represents Doktor Young, the author of the gloomy “Night Thoughts” and
“Der gute Lacher,--Lorenz Sterne” as occupying positions side by side in
his book-case.This proximity gives rise to a conversation between the
two antipodal British authors: Sterne says:

  “Wir brauchen beide vielen Raum,
  Your Reverence viel zum Händeringen,
  Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.”

and later,

 .“Und will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;
  Jüngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die
  Narrheit mich beym Rocke.Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,--Du!Du lachtest dich gesund.”

To Sterne’s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young
naturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life’s
evanescence and joy’s certain blight.But Sterne, though acknowledging
the transitoriness of life’s pleasures, denies Young’s deductions.Yorick’s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young’s picture and
one must admit that it has no justification in Sterne’s writings.On the
contrary, Yorick’s life was one long flight from the grim enemy.The
idea of death cherished by Asmus in his “Freund Hein,” the welcome
guest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne.Death
comes to Yorick in full dress, a youth, a Mercury:

  “Er thuts, er kommt zu mir, ‘Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!’
  So ruft er auf mich zu.‘Dein Haus fängt an zu wanken,
  Die Mauern spalten sich; Gewölb und Balken schwanken,
  Was nuzt dir so ein Haus?.’”

so he takes the wreathèd cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,
embracing him.“Das ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,
  Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schmückst,
  Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht’s in wenig Wochen,
  Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine Hände drückst?Ganz nach Bequemlichkeit!du bist mir zwar willkommen.”

The latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of the
part played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in Sterne’s
works only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a relation sometimes delicate
and clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the indelicate and sensual, is a
foregone conclusion.Undoubtedly some found in the general approbation
which was accorded Sterne’s books a sanction for forcing upon the public
the products of their own diseased imaginations.This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by
Wegener’s “Raritäten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des Küsters von
Rummelsberg.”[80] The first volume is dedicated to “Sebaldus Nothanker,”
and the long document claims for the author unusual distinction, in thus
foregoing the possibility of reward or favor, since he dedicates his
book to a fictitious personage.The idea of the book is to present
“merry observations” for every day in the year.With the end of the
fourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, the sixth volume includes May 22.The
present writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover whether
the year was rounded out in this way.The author claims to write “neither for surly Catos nor for those fond
of vulgar jests and smutty books,” but for those who will laugh.At the
close of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: “In
order to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne, I made
a decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly; indeed I
have burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of it with
warm English ale, but”--he had the insight and courtesy to add--“it
helped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps in the
footprints of one who can walk nimbly.” The very nature of this author’s
dependence on Sterne excludes here any extended analysis of the
connection.The style is abrupt, full of affected gaiety and raillery,
conversational and journalistic.The stories, observations and
reflections, in prose and verse, represent one and all the ribaldry of
Sterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for example, by the story of
the abbess of Andouillets, but without the charm and grace with which
that tale begins.The author copies Sterne in the tone of his
lucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.In the first
volume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne is the
introduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for January
11.The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes, present a
somewhat Sternesque appearance.These volumes are reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[81]
with full appreciation of their pernicious influence, and with open
acknowledgment that their success demonstrates a pervision of taste in
the fatherland.The author of the “Litterarische Reise durch
Deutschland”[82] advises his sister, to whom his letters are directed,
to put her handkerchief before her mouth at the very mention of Wegener,
and fears that the very name has befouled his pen.A similar
condemnation is meted out in Wieland’s _Merkur_.[83]

A similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a somewhat
similar collection of stories, “Der Geist der Romane im letzten Viertel
des 18ten Jahrhunderts,” Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which the
author (S. G.claims to follow the spirit of the period and
gives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin whitewash of
teary sentimentalism.The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his writings
in the German literary world of the century succeeding the era of his
great popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task.Such
references in books, letters and periodicals multiply beyond possibility
of systematic study.One might take the works[84] of Friedrich Matthison
as a case in point.He visits the grave of Musäus, even as Tristram
Shandy sought for the resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III,
p.312); as he travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would
have afforded Yorick’s “Empfindsamkeit” the finest material for an
Ash-Wednesday sermon (IV, p. 67).Sterne’s expressions are cited:
“Erdwasserball” for the earth (V, p.57), “Wo keine Pflanze, die da
nichts zu suchen hatte, eine bleibende Stäte fand” (V, p.302); two
farmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as “Nach dem Ideal Yoricks” (VI,
pp.He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets (VI,
64); he narrates (VIII, pp.203-4) an anecdote of Sterne which has just
been printed in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ (1769, p.Levade in Lausanne, who bore a striking resemblance to
Sterne (V, p.279), and refers to Yorick in other minor regards (VII,
158; VIII, pp.51, 77, and Briefe II, 76).Yet in spite of this evident
infatuation, Matthison’s account of his own travels cannot be classed as
an imitation of Yorick, but is purely objective, descriptive, without
search for humor or pathos, with no introduction of personalities save
friends and celebrities.Heinse alluded to Sterne frequently in his
letters to Gleim (1770-1771),[85] but after August 23, 1771, Sterne
vanished from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts
until 1802, a fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for
Sterne and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of
Yorick’s personal hold.Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and
duration of his popularity, may not be without interest: Kästner
“Vermischte Schriften,” II, p.134 (Steckenpferd); Lenz “Gesammelte
Werke,” Berlin, 1828, Vol.312; letter from the Duchess Amalie,
August 2, 1779, in “Briefe an und von Merck,” Darmstadt, 1838; letter of
Caroline Herder to Knebel, April 2, 1799, in “K. L.von Knebel’s
Literarischer Nachlass,” Leipzig, 1835, p.324 (Yorick’s “heiliges
Sensorium”); a rather unfavorable but apologetic criticism of Shandy in
the “Hinterlassene Schriften” of Charlotta Sophia Sidonia Seidelinn,
Nürnberg, 1793, p.227; “Schiller’s Briefe,” edited by Fritz Jonas, I,
pp.136, 239; in Hamann’s letters, “Leben und Schriften,” edited by Dr.C. H. Gildermeister, Gotha, 1875, II, p.16,
163; in C. L. Jünger’s “Anlage zu einem Familiengespräch über die
Physiognomik” in _Deutsches Museum_, II, pp.781-809, where the French
barber who proposes to dip Yorick’s wig in the sea is taken as a type of
exaggeration.And a similar reference is found in Wieland’s _Merkur_,
1799, I, p.15: Yorick’s Sensorium is again cited, _Merkur_, 1791, II,
p. 95.Other references in the _Merkur_ are: 1774, III, p.52; 1791, I,
p.19-21; _Deutsches Museum_, IV, pp.66, 462; _Neuer Gelehrter Mercurius_, Altona, 1773, August 19, in review
of Goethe’s “Götz;” _Almanach der deutschen Musen_, 1771, p. 93.And
thus the references scatter themselves down the decades.“Das Wörtlein
Und,” by F. A. Krummacher (Duisberg und Essen, 1811), bore a motto taken
from the Koran, and contained the story of Uncle Toby and the fly with a
personal application, and Yorick’s division of travelers is copied
bodily and applied to critics.Friedrich Hebbel, probably in 1828, gave
his Newfoundland dog the name of Yorick-Sterne-Monarch.[86] Yorick is
familiarly mentioned in Wilhelm Raabe’s “Chronik der Sperlingsgasse”
(1857), and in Ernst von Wolzogen’s “Der Dornenweg,” two characters
address one another in Yorick similes.Indeed, in the summer of 1902,
a Berlin newspaper was publishing “Eine Empfindsame Reise in einem
Automobile.”[87]

Musäus is named as an imitator of Sterne by Koberstein, and Erich
Schmidt implies in his “Richardson, Rousseau und Goethe,” that he
followed Sterne in his “Grandison der Zweite,” which could hardly be
possible, for “Grandison der Zweite” was first published in 1760, and
was probably written during 1759, that is, before Sterne had published
Tristram Shandy.Adolph von Knigge is also mentioned by Koberstein as a
follower of Sterne, and Baker includes Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” and “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” in his list.Their connection with Sterne cannot be designated as other than remote;
the former is a merry vagabond story, reminding one much more of the
tavern and way-faring adventures in Fielding and Smollett, and
suggesting Sterne only in the constant conversation with the reader
about the progress of the book and the mechanism of its construction.One example of the hobby-horse idea in this narration may perhaps be
traced to Sterne.The “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” has even
less connection; it shares only in the increase of interest in personal
accounts of travel.Knigge’s novels, “Peter Claus” and “Der Roman meines
Lebens,” are decidedly not imitations of Sterne; a clue to the character
of the former may be obtained from the fact that it was translated into
English as “The German Gil Blas.” “Der Roman meines Lebens” is a typical
eighteenth century love-story written in letters, with numerous
characters, various intrigues and unexpected adventures; indeed, a part
of the plot, involving the abduction of one of the characters, reminds
one of “Clarissa Harlowe.” Sterne is, however, incidentally mentioned in
both books, is quoted in “Peter Claus” (Chapter VI, Vol.II), and Walter
Shandy’s theory of Christian names is cited in “Der Roman meines
Lebens.”[88] That Knigge had no sympathy with exaggerated sentimentalism
is seen in a passage in his “Umgang mit Menschen.”[89] Knigge admired
and appreciated the real Sterne and speaks in his “Ueber Schriftsteller
und Schriftstellerei”[90] of Yorick’s sharpening observation regarding
the little but yet important traits of character.Moritz August von Thümmel in his famous “Reise in die mittäglichen
Provinzen von Frankreich” adopted Sterne’s general idea of sentimental
journeying, shorn largely of the capriciousness and whimsicality which
marked Sterne’s pilgrimage.He followed Sterne also in driving the
sensuous to the borderland of the sensual.Hippel’s novels, “Lebensläufe nach aufsteigender Linie” and “Kreuz und
Querzüge des Ritters A. bis Z.” were purely Shandean products in which a
humor unmistakably imitated from Sterne struggles rather unsuccessfully
with pedagogical seriousness.Jean Paul was undoubtedly indebted to
Sterne for a part of his literary equipment, and his works afford proof
both of his occupation with Sterne’s writings and its effect upon his
own.A study of Hippel’s “Lebensläufe” in connection with both Sterne
and Jean Paul was suggested but a few years after Hippel’s death by a
reviewer in the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[91] as a
fruitful topic for investigation.A detailed, minute study of von
Thümmel, Hippel and Jean Paul[92] in connection with the English master
is purposed as a continuation of the present essay.Heine’s pictures of
travel, too, have something of Sterne in them.[Footnote 1: _Quellen und Forschungen_, II, p. 27.][Footnote 2: Jacobi remarked, in his preface to the “Winterreise”
    in the edition of 1807, that this section, “Der Taubenschlag” is
    not to be reckoned as bearing the trace of the then condemned
    “Empfindeley,” for many authors, ancient and modern, have taken up
    the cause of animals against man; yet Sterne is probably the
    source of Jacobi’s expression of his feeling.][Footnote 3: XI, 2, pp.[Footnote 4: For reviews of the “Sommerreise” see _Allg.deutsche

    Sentimental Journey which was re-issued in four volumes, Hamburg
    and Bremen, 1769, whereas the edition was practically identical
    with the previous one, and the two added volumes were those of
    Stevenson’s continuation.Longo calls Sterne’s Eliza “Elisha”
    (p.28) and Tristram’s father becomes Sir Walter Shandy (p.37),
    an unwarranted exaltation of the retired merchant.][Footnote 6: Review in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gel.Sachen_]

OPPOSITION TO STERNE AND HIS TYPE OF SENTIMENTALISM


Sterne’s influence in Germany lived its own life, and gradually and
imperceptibly died out of letters, as an actuating principle.Yet its
dominion was not achieved without some measure of opposition.The
sweeping condemnation which the soberer critics heaped upon the
incapacities of his imitators has been exemplified in the accounts
already given of Schummel, Bock and others.It would be interesting to
follow a little more closely this current of antagonism.The tone of
protest was largely directed, the edge of satire was chiefly whetted,
against the misunderstanding adaptation of Yorick’s ways of thinking and
writing, and only here and there were voices raised to detract in any
way from the genius of Sterne.He never suffered in Germany such an
eclipse of fame as was his fate in England.He was to the end of the
chapter a recognized prophet, an uplifter and leader.The far-seeing,
clear-minded critics, as Lessing, Goethe and Herder, expressed
themselves quite unequivocally in this regard, and there was later no
withdrawal of former appreciation.Indeed, Goethe’s significant words
already quoted came from the last years of his life, when the new
century had learned to smile almost incredulously at the relation of a
bygone folly.In the very heyday of Sterne’s popularity, 1772, a critic of Wieland’s
“Diogenes” in the _Auserlesene Bibliothek der neuesten deutschen
Litteratur_[1] bewails Wieland’s imitation of Yorick, whom the critic
deems a far inferior writer, “Sterne, whose works will disappear, while
Wieland’s masterpieces are still the pleasure of latest posterity.” This
review of “Diogenes” is, perhaps, rather more an exaggerated compliment
to Wieland than a studied blow at Sterne, and this thought is recognized
by the reviewer in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,[2] who
designates the compliment as “dubious” and “insulting,” especially in
view of Wieland’s own personal esteem for Sterne.Yet these words, even
as a relative depreciation of Sterne during the period of his most
universal popularity, are not insignificant.Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
a tutor at Saarbrücken, in 1770, records that one member of a reading
club which he had founded “regarded his taste as insulted because I sent
him “Yorick’s Empfindsame Reise.”[3] But Wagner regarded this instance
as a proof of Saarbrücken ignorance, stupidity and lack of taste; hence
the incident is but a wavering testimony when one seeks to determine the
amount and nature of opposition to Yorick.We find another derogatory fling at Sterne himself and a regret at the
extent of his influence in an anonymous book entitled “Betrachtungen
über die englischen Dichter,”[4] published at the end of the great
Yorick decade.The author compares Sterne most unfavorably with Addison:
“If the humor of the _Spectator_ and _Tatler_ be set off against the
digressive whimsicality of Sterne,” he says, “it is, as if one of the
Graces stood beside a Bacchante.And yet the pampered taste of the
present day takes more pleasure in a Yorick than in an Addison.” But a
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5] discounts this
author’s criticisms of men of established fame, such as Shakespeare,
Swift, Yorick, and suggests youth, or brief acquaintance with English
literature, as occasion for his inadequate judgments.Indeed, Yorick
disciples were quick to resent any shadow cast upon his name.Thus the
remark in a letter printed in the _Deutsches Museum_ that Asmus was the
German Yorick “only a better moral character,” called forth a long
article in the same periodical for September, 1779, by L. H. N.,[6]
vigorously defending Sterne as a man and a writer.The greatness of his
human heart and the breadth and depth of his sympathies are given as the
unanswerable proofs of his moral worth.This defense is vehemently
seconded in the same magazine by Joseph von Retzer.The one great opponent of the whole sentimental tendency, whose censure
of Sterne’s disciples involved also a denunciation of the master
himself, was the Göttingen professor, Georg Christopher Lichtenberg.[7]
In his inner nature Lichtenberg had much in common with Sterne and
Sterne’s imitators in Germany, with the whole ecstatic, eccentric
movement of the time.Julian Schmidt[8] says: “So much is sure, at any
rate, that the greatest adversary of the new literature was of one flesh
and blood with it.”[9] But his period of residence in England shortly
after Sterne’s death and his association then and afterwards with
Englishmen of eminence render his attitude toward Sterne in large
measure an English one, and make an idealization either of the man or of
his work impossible for him.The contradiction between the greatness of heart evinced in Sterne’s
novels and the narrow selfishness of the author himself is repeatedly
noted by Lichtenberg.His knowledge of Sterne’s character was derived
from acquaintance with many of Yorick’s intimate friends in London.In
“Beobachtungen über den Menschen,” he says: “I can’t help smiling when
the good souls who read Sterne with tears of rapture in their eyes fancy
that he is mirroring himself in his book.Sterne’s simplicity, his warm
heart, over-flowing with feeling, his soul, sympathizing with everything
good and noble, and all the other expressions, whatever they may be; and
the sigh ‘Alas, poor Yorick,’ which expresses everything at once--have
become proverbial among us Germans. . . .Yorick was a crawling
parasite, a flatterer of the great, an unendurable burr on the clothing
of those upon whom he had determined to sponge!”[10]

In “Timorus” he calls Sterne “ein scandalum Ecclesiae”;[11] he doubts
the reality of Sterne’s nobler emotions and condemns him as a clever
juggler with words, who by artful manipulation of certain devices
aroused in us sympathy, and he snatches away the mask of loving, hearty
sympathy and discloses the grinning mountebank.With keen insight into
Sterne’s mind and method, he lays down a law by which, he says, it is
always possible to discover whether the author of a touching passage has
really been moved himself, or has merely with astute knowledge of the
human heart drawn our tears by a sly choice of touching features.[12]

Akin to this is the following passage in which the author is
unquestionably thinking of Sterne, although he does not mention him:
“A heart ever full of kindly feeling is the greatest gift which Heaven
can bestow; on the other hand, the itching to keep scribbling about it,
and to fancy oneself great in this scribbling is one of the greatest
punishments which can be inflicted upon one who writes.”[13] He exposes
the heartlessness of Sterne’s pretended sympathy: “A three groschen
piece is ever better than a tear,”[14] and “sympathy is a poor kind of
alms-giving,”[15] are obviously thoughts suggested by Yorick’s
sentimentalism.[16]

The folly of the “Lorenzodosen” is several times mentioned with open or
covert ridicule[17] and the imitators of Sterne are repeatedly told the
fruitlessness of their endeavor and the absurdity of their
accomplishment.[18] His “Vorschlag zu einem Orbis Pictus für deutsche
dramatische Schriftsteller, Romanendichter und Schauspieler”[19] is a
satire on the lack of originality among those who boasted of it, and
sought to win attention through pure eccentricities.The Fragments[20] are concerned, as the editors say, with an evil of the
literature in those days, the period of the Sentimentalists and the
“Kraftgenies.” Among the seven fragments may be noted: “Lorenzo
Eschenheimers empfindsame Reise nach Laputa,” a clever satirical sketch
in the manner of Swift, bitterly castigating that of which the English
people claim to be the discoverers (sentimental journeying) and the
Germans think themselves the improvers.In “Bittschrift der
Wahnsinnigen” and “Parakletor” the unwholesome literary tendencies of
the age are further satirized.His brief essay, “Ueber die
Vornamen,”[21] is confessedly suggested by Sterne and the sketch “Dass
du auf dem Blockberg wärst,”[22] with its mention of the green book
entitled “Echte deutsche Flüche und Verwünschungen für alle Stände,” is
manifestly to be connected in its genesis with Sterne’s famous
collection of oaths.[23] Lichtenberg’s comparison of Sterne and Fielding
is familiar and significant.[24] “Aus Lichtenbergs Nachlass: Aufsätze,
Gedichte, Tagebuchblätter, Briefe,” edited by Albert Leitzmann,[25]
contains additional mention of Sterne.The name of Helfreich Peter Sturz may well be coupled with that of
Lichtenberg, as an opponent of the Sterne cult and its German
distortions, for his information and point of view were likewise drawn
direct from English sources.Sturz accompanied King Christian VII of
Denmark on his journey to France and England, which lasted from May 6,
1768, to January 14, 1769[26]; hence his stay in England falls in a time
but a few months after Sterne’s death (March 18, 1768), when the
ungrateful metropolis was yet redolent of the late lion’s wit and humor.Sturz was an accomplished linguist and a complete master of English,
hence found it easy to associate with Englishmen of distinction whom he
was privileged to meet through the favor of his royal patron.He became
acquainted with Garrick, who was one of Sterne’s intimate friends, and
from him Sturz learned much of Yorick, especially that more wholesome
revulsion of feeling against Sterne’s obscenities and looseness of
speech, which set in on English soil as soon as the potent personality
of the author himself had ceased to compel silence and blind opinion.England began to wonder at its own infatuation, and, gaining
perspective, to view the writings of Sterne in a more rational light.Into the first spread of this reaction Sturz was introduced, and the
estimate of Sterne which he carried away with him was undoubtedly
 by it.In his second letter written to the _Deutsches Museum_
and dated August 24, 1768, but strangely not printed till April,
1777,[27] he quotes Garrick with reference to Sterne, a notable word of
personal censure, coming in the Germany of that decade, when Yorick’s
admirers were most vehement in their claims.Garrick called him “a lewd
companion, who was more loose in his intercourse than in his writings
and generally drove all ladies away by his obscenities.”[28] Sturz adds
that all his acquaintances asserted that Sterne’s moral character went
through a process of disintegration in London.In the _Deutsches Museum_ for July, 1776, Sturz printed a poem entitled
“Die Mode,” in which he treats of the slavery of fashion and in several
stanzas deprecates the influence of Yorick.[29]

  “Und so schwingt sich, zum Genie erklärt,
  Strephon kühn auf Yorick’s Steckenpferd.Trabt mäandrisch über Berg und Auen,
  Reist empfindsam durch sein Dorfgebiet,
  Oder singt die Jugend zu erbauen
  Ganz Gefühl dem Gartengott ein Lied.Gott der Gärten, stöhnt die Bürgerin,
  Lächle gütig, Rasen und Schasmin
  Haucht Gerüche!Fliehet Handlungssorgen,
  Dass mein Liebster heute noch in Ruh
  Sein Mark-Einsaz-Lomber spiele--Morgen,
  Schliessen wir die Unglücksbude zu!”

A passage at the end of the appendix to the twelfth Reisebrief is
further indication of his opposition to and his contempt for the frenzy
of German sentimentalism.The poems of Goeckingk contain allusions[30] to Sterne, to be sure
partly indistinctive and insignificant, which, however, tend in the main
to a ridicule of the Yorick cult and place their author ultimately among
the satirical opponents of sentimentalism.In the “Epistel an Goldhagen
in Petershage,” 1771, he writes:

  “Doch geb ich wohl zu überlegen,
  Was für den Weisen besser sey:
  Die Welt wie Yorick mit zu nehmen?Nach Königen, wie Diogen,
  Sich keinen Fuss breit zu bequemen,”--

a query which suggests the hesitant point of view relative to the
advantage of Yorick’s excess of universal sympathy.In “Will auch ’n
Genie werden” the poet steps out more unmistakably as an adversary of
the movement and as a skeptical observer of the exercise of Yorick-like
sympathy.“Doch, ich Patronus, merkt das wohl,
    Geh, im zerrissnen Kittel,
  Hab’ aber alle Taschen voll
    Yorickischer Capittel.Doch lass’ ich, wenn mir’s Kurzweil schafft,
    Die Hülfe fleh’nden Armen
  Durch meinen Schweitzer, Peter Kraft,
    Zerprügeln ohn’ Erbarmen.”

Goeckingk openly satirizes the sentimental cult in the poem “Der
Empfindsame”

  “Herr Mops, der um das dritte Wort
  Empfindsamkeit im Munde führet,
  Und wenn ein Grashalm ihm verdorrt,
  Gleich einen Thränenstrom verlieret--
     .Mit meinem Weibchen thut er schier
  Gleich so bekannt wie ein Franzose;
  All’ Augenblicke bot er ihr
  Toback aus eines Bettlers Dose
  Mit dem, am Zaun in tiefem Schlaf
  Er einen Tausch wie Yorik traf.Der Unempfindsamkeit zum Hohn
  Hielt er auf eine Mück’ im Glase
  Beweglich einen Leichsermon,
  Purrt’ eine Flieg’ ihm an der Nase,
  Macht’ er das Fenster auf, und sprach:
  Zieh Oheim Toby’s Fliege nach!Durch Mops ist warlich meine Magd
  Nicht mehr bey Trost, nicht mehr bey Sinnen
  So sehr hat ihr sein Lob behagt,
  Dass sie empfindsam allen Spinnen
  Zu meinem Hause, frank und frey
  Verstattet ihre Weberey.Er trat mein Hündchen auf das Bein,
  Hilf Himmel!Welch’ ein Lamentiren!Es hätte mögen einen Stein
  Der Strasse zum Erbarmen rühren,
  Auch wedelt’ ihm in einem Nu
  Das Hündgen schon Vergebung zu.Hündchen, du beschämst mich sehr,
  Denn dass mir Mops von meinem Leben
  Drey Stunden stahl, wie schwer, wie schwer,
  Wird’s halten, das ihm zu vergeben?Denn Spinnen werden oben ein
  Wohl gar noch meine Mörder seyn.”

This poem is a rather successful bit of ridicule cast on the
over-sentimental who sought to follow Yorick’s foot-prints.The other allusions to Sterne[31] are concerned with his hobby-horse
idea, for this seems to gain the poet’s approbation and to have no share
in his censure.The dangers of overwrought sentimentality, of heedless surrender to the
emotions and reveling in their exercise,--perils to whose magnitude
Sterne so largely contributed--were grasped by saner minds, and
energetic protest was entered against such degradation of mind and
futile expenditure of feeling.Joachim Heinrich Campe, the pedagogical theorist, published in 1779[32]
a brochure, “Ueber Empfindsamkeit und Empfindelei in pädagogischer
Hinsicht,” in which he deprecates the tendency of “Empfindsamkeit” to
degenerate into “Empfindelei,” and explains at some length the
deleterious effects of an unbridled “Empfindsamkeit” and an unrestrained
outpouring of sympathetic emotions which finds no actual expression, no
relief in deeds.The substance of this warning essay is repeated, often
word for word, but considerably amplified with new material, and
rendered more convincing by increased breadth of outlook and
positiveness of assertion, the fruit of six years of observation and
reflection, as part of a treatise, entitled, “Von der nöthigen Sorge für
die Erhaltung des Gleichgewichts unter den menschlichen Kräften:
Besondere Warnung vor dem Modefehler die Empfindsamkeit zu überspannen.”
It is in the third volume of the “Allgemeine Revision des gesammten
Schul- und Erziehungswesens.”[33] The differentiation between
“Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei” is again and more accessibly repeated
in Campe’s later work, “Ueber die Reinigung und Bereicherung der
deutschen Sprache.”[34] In the second form of this essay (1785) Campe
speaks of the sentimental fever as an epidemic by no means entirely
cured.His analysis of “Empfindsamkeit” is briefly as follows: “Empfindsamkeit
ist die Empfänglichkeit zu Empfindnissen, in denen etwas Sittliches d.i.Freude oder Schmerz über etwas sittlich Gutes oder sittlich Böses, ist;”
yet in common use the term is applied only to a certain high degree of
such susceptibility.This sensitiveness is either in harmony or discord
with the other powers of the body, especially with the reason: if
equilibrium is maintained, this sensitiveness is a fair, worthy,
beneficent capacity (Fähigkeit); if exalted over other forces, it
becomes to the individual and to society the most destructive and
baneful gift which refinement and culture may bestow.Campe proposes to
limit the use of the word “Empfindsamkeit” to the justly proportioned
manifestation of this susceptibility; the irrational, exaggerated
development he would designate “überspannte Empfindsamkeit.”
“Empfindelei,” he says, “ist Empfindsamkeit, die sich auf eine
kleinliche alberne, vernunftlose und lächerliche Weise, also da äussert,
wo sie nicht hingehörte.” Campe goes yet further in his distinctions and
invents the monstrous word, “Empfindsamlichkeit” for the sentimentality
which is superficial, affected, sham (geheuchelte).Campe’s newly coined
word was never accepted, and in spite of his own efforts and those of
others to honor the word “Empfindsamkeit” and restrict it to the
commendable exercise of human sympathy, the opposite process was
victorious and “Empfindsamkeit,” maligned and scorned, came to mean
almost exclusively, unless distinctly modified, both what Campe
designates as “überspannte Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei,” and also
the absurd hypocrisy of the emotions which he seeks to cover with his
new word.Campe’s farther consideration contains a synopsis of method
for distinguishing “Empfindsamkeit” from “Empfindelei:” in the first
place through the manner of their incitement,--the former is natural,
the latter is fantastic, working without sense of the natural properties
of things.In this connection he instances as examples, Yorick’s feeling
of shame after his heartless and wilful treatment of Father Lorenzo,
and, in contrast with this, the shallowness of Sterne’s imitators who
whimpered over the death of a violet, and stretched out their arms and
threw kisses to the moon and stars.In the second place they are
distinguished in the manner of their expression: “Empfindsamkeit” is
“secret, unpretentious, laconic and serious;” the latter attracts
attention, is theatrical, voluble, whining, vain.Thirdly, they are
known by their fruits, in the one case by deeds, in the other by shallow
pretension.In the latter part of his volume, Campe treats the problem
of preventing the perverted form of sensibility by educative endeavor.The word “Empfindsamkeit” was afterwards used sometimes simply as an
equivalent of “Empfindung,” or sensation, without implication of the
manner of sensing: for example one finds in the _Morgenblatt_[35] a poem
named “Empfindsamkeiten am Rheinfalle vom Felsen der Galerie
abgeschrieben.” In the poem various travelers are made to express their
thoughts in view of the waterfall.A poet cries, “Ye gods, what a hell
of waters;” a tradesman, “away with the rock;” a Briton complains of the
“confounded noise,” and so on.It is plain that the word suffered a
generalization of meaning.A poetical expression of Campe’s main message is found in a book called
“Winterzeitvertreib eines königlichen preussischen Offiziers.”[36]
A poem entitled “Das empfindsame Herz” (p.210) has the following lines:

  “Freund, ein empfindsames Herz ist nicht für diese Welt,
  Von Schelmen wird’s verlacht, von Thoren wirds geprellt,
  Doch üb’ im Stillen das, was seine Stimme spricht.Dein Lohn ist dir gewiss, nur hier auf Erden nicht.”

In a similar vein of protest is the letter of G. Hartmann[37] to Denis,
dated Tübingen, February 10, 1773, in which the writer condemns the
affected sentimentalism of Jacobi and others as damaging to morals.“O best teacher,” he pleads with Denis, “continue to represent these
performances as unworthy.”

Möser in his “Patriotische Phantasien”[38] represents himself as
replying to a maid-in-waiting who writes in distress about her young
mistress, because the latter is suffering from “epidemic”
sentimentalism, and is absurdly unreasonable in her practical incapacity
and her surrender to her feelings.Möser’s sound advice is the
substitution of genuine emotion.The whole section is entitled “Für die
Empfindsamen.”

Knigge, in his “Umgang mit Menschen,” plainly has those Germans in mind
who saw in Uncle Toby’s treatment of the fly an incentive to
unreasonable emphasis upon the relations between man and the animal
world, when, in the chapter on the treatment of animals, he protests
against the silly, childish enthusiasm of those who cannot see a hen
killed, but partake of fowl greedily on the table, or who passionately
open the window for a fly.[39] A work was also translated from the
French of Mistelet, which dealt with the problem of “Empfindsamkeit:”
it was entitled “Ueber die Empfindsamkeit in Rücksicht auf das Drama,
die Romane und die Erziehung.”[40] An article condemning exaggerated
sentimentality was published in the _Deutsches Museum_ for February,
1783, under the title “Etwas über deutsche Empfindsamkeit.”

Goethe’s “Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit” is a merry satire on the
sentimental movement, but is not to be connected directly with Sterne,
since Goethe is more particularly concerned with the petty imitators of
his own “Werther.” Baumgartner in his Life of Goethe asserts that
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey was one of the books found inside the
ridiculous doll which the love-sick Prince Oronaro took about with him.This is not a necessary interpretation, for Andrason, when he took up
the first book, exclaimed merely “Empfindsamkeiten,” and, as Strehlke
observes,[41] it is not necessary here to think of a single work,
because the term was probably used in a general way, referring possibly
to a number of then popular imitations.The satires on “Empfindsamkeit” began to grow numerous at the end of the
seventies and the beginning of the eighties, so that the _Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung_, in October, 1785, feels justified in remarking that
such attempts are gradually growing as numerous as the “Empfindsame
Romane” themselves, and wishes, “so may they rot together in a
grave of oblivion.”[42] Anton Reiser, the hero of Karl Philipp
Moritz’sautobiographical novel (Berlin, 1785-90), begins a satire on
affected sentimentalism, which was to bring shafts of ridicule to bear
on the popular sham, and to throw appreciative light on the real
manifestation of genuine feeling.[43] A kindred satire was “Die
Geschichte eines Genies,” Leipzig, 1780, two volumes, in which the
prevailing fashion of digression is incidentally satirized.[44]

The most extensive satire on the sentimental movement, and most vehement
protest against its excesses is the four volume novel, “Der
Empfindsame,”[45] published anonymously in Erfurt, 1781-3, but
acknowledged in the introduction to the fourth volume by its author,
Christian Friedrich Timme.He had already published one novel in which
he exemplified in some measure characteristics of the novelists whom he
later sought to condemn and satirize, that is, this first novel,
“Faramond’s Familiengeschichte,”[46] is digressive and episodical.“Der
Empfindsame” is much too bulky to be really effective as a satire; the
reiteration of satirical jibes, the repetition of satirical motifs
slightly varied, or thinly veiled, recoil upon the force of the work
itself and injure the effect.The maintenance of a single satire through
the thirteen to fourteen hundred pages which four such volumes contain
is a Herculean task which we can associate only with a genius like
Cervantes.Then, too, Timme is an excellent narrator, and his original
purpose is constantly obscured by his own interest and the reader’s
interest in Timme’s own story, in his original creations, in the variety
of his characters.These obtrude upon the original aim of the book and
absorb the action of the story in such a measure that Timme often for
whole chapters and sections seems to forget entirely the convention of
his outsetting.His attack is threefold, the centers of his opposition being “Werther,”
“Siegwart” and Sterne, as represented by their followers and imitators.But the campaign is so simple, and the satirist has been to such trouble
to label with care the direction of his own blows, that it is not
difficult to separate the thrusts intended for each of his foes.Timme’s initial purpose is easily illustrated by reference to his first
chapter, where his point of view is compactly put and the soundness of
his critical judgment and the forcefulness of his satirical bent are
unequivocally demonstrated: This chapter, which, as he says, “may serve
instead of preface and introduction,” is really both, for the narrative
really begins only in the second chapter.“Every nation, every age,”
he says, “has its own doll as a plaything for its children, and
sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit) is ours.” Then with lightness and grace,
coupled with unquestionable critical acumen, he traces briefly the
growth of “Empfindsamkeit” in Germany.“Kaum war der liebenswürdige
Sterne auf sein Steckenpferd gestiegen, und hatte es uns vorgeritten;
so versammelten sich wie gewöhnlich in Teutschland alle Jungen an ihn
herum, hingen sich an ihn, oder schnizten sich sein Steckenpferd in der
Geschwindigkeit nach, oder brachen Stecken vom nächsten Zaun oder rissen
aus einem Reissigbündel den ersten besten Prügel, setzten sich darauf
und ritten mit einer solchen Wut hinter ihm drein, dass sie einen
Luftwirbel veranlassten, der alles, was ihm zu nahe kam, wie ein
reissender Strom mit sich fortris, wär es nur unter den Jungen
geblieben, so hätte es noch sein mögen; aber unglücklicherweise fanden
auch Männer Geschmack an dem artigen Spielchen, sprangen vom ihrem Weg
ab und ritten mit Stok und Degen und Amtsperüken unter den Knaben
einher.Freilich erreichte keiner seinen Meister, den sie sehr bald aus
dem Gesicht verloren, und nun die possirlichsten Sprünge von der Welt
machen und doch bildet sich jeder der Affen ein, er reite so schön wie
der Yorick.”[47]

This lively description of Sterne’s part in this uprising is, perhaps,
the best brief characterization of the phenomenon and is all the more
significant as coming from the pen of a contemporary, and written only
about a decade after the inception of the sentimental movement as
influenced and furthered by the translation of the Sentimental Journey.It represents a remarkable critical insight into contemporaneous
literary movements, the rarest of all critical gifts, but it has been
overlooked by investigators who have sought and borrowed brief words to
characterize the epoch.[48]

The contribution of “Werther” and “Siegwart” to the sentimental frenzy
are even as succinctly and graphically designated; the latter book,
published in 1776, is held responsible for a recrudescence of the
phenomenon, because it gave a new direction, a new tone to the faltering
outbursts of Sterne’s followers and indicated a more comprehensible and
hence more efficient, outlet for their sentimentalism.Now again, “every
nook resounded with the whining sentimentality, with sighs, kisses,
forget-me-nots, moonshine, tears and ecstasies;” those hearts excited by
Yorick’s gospel, gropingly endeavoring to find an outlet for their own
emotions which, in their opinion were characteristic of their arouser
and stimulator, found through “Siegwart” a solution of their problem,
a relief for their emotional excess.Timme insists that his attack is only on Yorick’s mistaken followers and
not on Sterne himself.He contrasts the man and his imitators at the
outset sharply by comments on a quotation from the novel, “Fragmente zur
Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit”[49] as typifying the outcry of these petty
imitators against the heartlessness of their misunderstanding
critics,--“Sanfter, dultender Yorick,” he cries, “das war nicht deine
Sprache!Du priesest dich nicht mit einer pharisäischen
Selbstgenügsamkeit und schimpftest nicht auf die, die dir nicht ähnlich
waren, ‘Doch!sprachst Du am Grabe Lorenzos, doch ich bin so weichherzig
wie ein Weib, aber ich bitte die Welt nicht zu lachen, sondern mich zu
bedauern!’ Ruhe deinem Staube, sanfter, liebevoller Dulter!und nur
einen Funken deines Geistes deinen Affen.”[50] He writes not for the
“gentle, tender souls on whom the spirit of Yorick rests,”[51] for those
whose feelings are easily aroused and who make quick emotional return,
who love and do the good, the beautiful, the noble; but for those who
“bei dem wonnigen Wehen und Anhauchen der Gottheithaltenden Natur, in
huldigem Liebessinn und himmelsüssem Frohsein dahin schmelzt.die ihr
vom Sang der Liebe, von Mondschein und Tränen euch nährt,” etc.,
etc.[52] In these few words he discriminates between the man and his
influence, and outlines his intentions to satirize and chastise the
insidious disease which had fastened itself upon the literature of the
time.This passage, with its implied sincerity of appreciation for the
real Yorick, is typical of Timme’s attitude throughout the book, and his
concern lest he should appear at any time to draw the English novelist
into his condemnation leads him to reiterate this statement of purpose
and to insist upon the contrast.Brükmann, a young theological student, for a time an intimate of the
Kurt home, is evidently intended to represent the soberer, well-balanced
thought of the time in opposition to the feverish sentimental frenzy of
the Kurt household.He makes an exception of Yorick in his condemnation
of the literary favorites, the popular novelists of that day, but he
deplores the effects of misunderstood imitation of Yorick’s work, and
argues his case with vehemence against this sentimental group.[53]
Brükmann differentiates too the different kinds of sentimentalism and
their effects in much the same fashion as Campe in his treatise
published two years before.[54] In all this Brükmann may be regarded as
the mouth-piece of the author.The clever daughter of the gentleman who
entertains Pank at his home reads a satirical poem on the then popular
literature, but expressly disclaims any attack on Yorick or “Siegwart,”
and asserts that her bitterness is intended for their imitators.Lotte,
Pank’s sensible and unsentimental, long-suffering fiancée, makes further
comment on the “apes” of Yorick, “Werther,” and “Siegwart.”

The unfolding of the story is at the beginning closely suggestive of
Tristram Shandy and is evidently intended to follow the Sterne novel in
a measure as a model.As has already been suggested, Timme’s own
narrative powers balk the continuity of the satire, but aid the interest
and the movement of the story.The movement later is, in large measure,
simple and direct.The hero is first introduced at his christening, and
the discussion of fitting names in the imposing family council is taken
from Walter Shandy’s hobby.The narrative here, in Sterne fashion, is
interrupted by a Shandean digression[55] concerning the influence of
clergymen’s collars and neck-bands upon the thoughts and minds of their
audiences.Such questions of chance influence of trifles upon the
greater events of life is a constant theme of speculation among the
pragmatics; no petty detail is overlooked in the possibility of its
portentous consequences.Walter Shandy’s hyperbolic philosophy turned
about such a focus, the exaltation of insignificant trifles into
mainsprings of action.In Shandy fashion the story doubles on itself after the introduction and
gives minute details of young Kurt’s family and the circumstances prior
to his birth.The later discussion[56] in the family council concerning
the necessary qualities in the tutor to be hired for the young Kurt is
distinctly a borrowing from Shandy.[57] Timme imitates Sterne’s method
of ridiculing pedantry; the requirements listed by the Diaconus and the
professor are touches of Walter Shandy’s misapplied, warped, and
undigested wisdom.In the nineteenth chapter of the third volume[58] we
find a Sterne passage associating itself with Shandy rather more than
the Sentimental Journey.It is a playful thrust at a score of places in
Shandy in which the author converses with the reader about the progress
of the book, and allows the mechanism of book-printing and the vagaries
of publishers to obtrude themselves upon the relation between writer and
reader.As a reminiscence of similar promises frequent in Shandy, the
author promises in the first chapter of the fourth volume to write a
book with an eccentric title dealing with a list of absurdities.[59]

But by far the greater proportion of the allusions to Sterne associate
themselves with the Sentimental Journey.A former acquaintance of Frau
Kurt, whose favorite reading was Shandy, Wieland’s “Sympatien” and the
Sentimental Journey, serves to satirize the influence of Yorick’s ass
episode; this gentleman wept at the sight of an ox at work, and never
ate meat lest he might incur the guilt of the murder of these sighing
creatures.[60]

The most constantly recurring form of satire is that of contradiction
between the sentimental expression of elevated, universal sympathy and
broader humanity and the failure to seize an immediately presented
opportunity to embody desire in deed.Thus Frau Kurt,[61] buried in
“Siegwart,” refuses persistently to be disturbed by those in immediate
need of a succoring hand.Pankraz and his mother while on a drive
discover an old man weeping inconsolably over the death of his dog.[62]
The scene of the dead ass at Nampont occurs at once to Madame Kurt and
she compares the sentimental content of these two experiences in
deprivation, finding the palm of sympathy due to the melancholy
dog-bewailer before her, thereby exalting the sentimental privilege of
her own experience as a witness.Quoting Yorick, she cries: “Shame on
the world!If men only loved one another as this man loves his dog!”[63]
At this very moment the reality of her sympathy is put to the test by
the approach of a wretched woman bearing a wretched child, begging for
assistance, but Frau Kurt, steeped in the delight of her sympathetic
emotion, repulses her rudely.Pankraz, on going home, takes his Yorick
and reads again the chapter containing the dead-ass episode; he spends
much time in determining which event was the more affecting, and tears
flow at the thought of both animals.In the midst of his vehement curses
on “unempfindsame Menschen,” “a curse upon you, you hard-hearted
monsters, who treat God’s creatures unkindly,” etc., he rebukes the
gentle advances of his pet cat Riepel, rebuffs her for disturbing his
“Wonnegefühl,” in such a heartless and cruel way that, through an
accident in his rapt delight at human sympathy, the ultimate result is
the poor creature’s death by his own fault.In the second volume[64] Timme repeats this method of satire, varying
conditions only, yet forcing the matter forward, ultimately, into the
grotesque comic, but again taking his cue from Yorick’s narrative about
the ass at Nampont, acknowledging specifically his linking of the
adventure of Madame Kurt to the episode in the Sentimental Journey.Frau
Kurt’s ardent sympathy is aroused for a goat drawing a wagon, and driven
by a peasant.She endeavors to interpret the sighs of the beast and
finally insists upon the release of the animal, which she asserts is
calling to her for aid.The poor goat’s parting bleat after its
departing owner is construed as a curse on the latter’s hardheartedness.During the whole scene the
neighboring village is in flames, houses are consumed and poor people
rendered homeless, but Frau Kurt expresses no concern, even regarding
the catastrophe as a merited affliction, because of the villagers’ lack
of sympathy with their domestic animals.The same means of satire is
again employed in the twelfth chapter of the same volume.[65] Pankraz,
overcome with pain because Lotte, his betrothed, fails to unite in his
sentimental enthusiasm and persists in common-sense, tries to bury his
grief in a wild ride through night and storm.His horse tramples
ruthlessly on a poor old man in the road; the latter cries for help, but
Pank, buried in contemplation of Lotte’s lack of sensibility, turns a
deaf ear to the appeal.In the seventeenth chapter of the third volume, a sentimental journey is
proposed, and most of the fourth volume is an account of this
undertaking and the events arising from its complications.Pankraz’s
adventures are largely repetitions of former motifs, and illustrate the
fate indissolubly linked with an imitation of Sterne’s related converse
with the fair sex.[66]

The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries.Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes.Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.[67]

Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of suggestions
aroused through fancied parallels between his own circumstances and
those related of Yorick.He finds a sorrowing woman[68] sitting, like
Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar tree.Pankraz insists upon carrying
out this striking analogy farther, which the woman, though she betrays
no knowledge of the Sentimental Journey, is not loath to accede to, as
it coincides with her own nefarious purposes.Timme in the following
scene strikes a blow at the abjectly sensual involved in much of the
then sentimental, unrecognized and unrealized.Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.[69] He buys the poor
creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the goat.The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee.The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs.Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it.The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,--a point already enforced in the conduct of Frau Kurt’s
goat.In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to “Eliza”
is brought into the narrative.Pankraz writes a letter wherein he
declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs.Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy[70] of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere.The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”

The elaborate division of moral preachers[71] into classes may be
further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered.And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters.But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked.On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened.And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time.Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies.Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion.Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries.The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and adaptation
of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and bespeaks
admiration and commendation.Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but it
never received the critical examination its merits deserved.Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ and the _Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_
ignore it completely.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_ announces the
book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the book itself is not reviewed
in its columns.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ accords
it a colorless and unappreciative review in which Timme is reproached
for lack of order in his work (a censure more applicable to the first
volume), and further for his treatment of German authors then
popular.[72] The latter statement stamps the review as unsympathetic
with Timme’s satirical purpose.In the _Erfurtische gelehrte
Zeitung_,[73] in the very house of its own publication, the novel is
treated in a long review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of
comprehension and indignant denunciation.The reviewer fears that the
author is a “Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the
public will find no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting
(Schnaken).He is incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were
then degenerate as compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s
attack on the popular writers is emphatically resented.“Aber nun kömmt
das Schlimme erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten
Schenies, aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden,
dem Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w.zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”

In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed.Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself.It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[74] alone seems to grasp the full
significance of the satire.“We acknowledge gladly,” says the reviewer,
“that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the rise,
development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence of
this moral pestilence;.that the author has penetrated deep into
the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for an
engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”

The second and third volumes are reviewed[75] with a brief word of
continued approbation.A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes.The book is more
earnest in its conception.Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel.He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
_dénouement_.The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination.This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a sad, a gentle, a vehement, a dallying,
a serious, a melancholy, sentimentality, the last being the most poetic,
the most perilous.The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing.In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality.This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure.She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.The story begins in letters,--a method of story-telling which was the
legacy of Richardson’s popularity--and this device is again employed in
the second volume (Part VII).Wilhelmine Arend is one of those whom
sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.We read of
her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a feather, that
she turned white and trembled when Dr.Braun hacked worms to pieces in
conducting a biological experiment.On one occasion she refused to drive
home, as this would take the horses out in the noonday sun and disturb
their noonday meal,--an exorbitant sympathy with brute creation which
owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.It is not necessary here to relate
the whole story.Wilhelmine’s excessive sentimentality estranges her
from her husband, a weak brutish man, who has no comprehension of her
feelings.He finds a refuge in the debasing affections of a French
opera-singer, Pouilly, and gradually sinks to the very lowest level of
degradation.This all is accomplished by the interposition and active
concern of friends, by efforts at reunion managed by benevolent
intriguers and kindly advisers.Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its sane
characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the observations
upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book are
trenchant, and often markedly clever.Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing.The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode.The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out.Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made.Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition.Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly because his leading character is not convincing, but
largely because his satirical exaggeration, and distortion of
characteristics, which by a process of selection renders satire
efficient, fails to make the exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but
renders her pitiful.At the same time this satirical warping impairs the
value of the book as a serious presentation of a prevailing malady.A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”[76] In this book we have a character with a
heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is attributed
“an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist a single
impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the present
impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of Graf.Z.,
the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife, their
reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness of
heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of the
same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”

Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary review,
“Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein blaues
Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777, 8vo).The book purports to be the
posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted with Yorick’s
German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick himself.The
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ (1778, pp.99-100) finds that the author
misjudges Yorick.The book is written in part if not entirely in verse.In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s _Merkur_ writes, begging this
authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey, M . . .and “die Beyträge zur Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und
Verstandes,” and thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”

In this way it is seen how from various sources and in various ways
protest was made against the real or distorted message of Laurence
Sterne.[Footnote 2: 1772, July 7.][Footnote 3: See Erich Schmidt’s “Heinrich Leopold Wagner,

    that the underlying thought of Musäus in his “Physiognomische
    Reisen” would, if handled by Lichtenberg, have made the most
    fruitful stuff for a humorous novel in Sterne’s style.][Footnote 12: II, 11-12: “Im ersten Fall wird er nie, nach dem die
    Stelle vorüber ist, seinen Sieg plötzlich aufgeben.So wie bei ihm
    sich die Leidenschaft kühlt, kühlt sie sich auch bei uns und er
    bringt uns ab, ohne dass wir es wissen.Hingegen im letztern Fall
    nimmt er sich selten die Mühe, sich seines Sieges zu bedienen,
    sondern wirft den Leser oft mehr zur Bewunderung seiner Kunst, als
    seines Herzens in eine andere Art von Verfassung hinein, die ihn

    er vorher gewonnen hatte.”]

  durch Frankreich und Italien, übersetzt von A. Lewald.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!_Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--
 To keep unstain'd the glory of these chains--
 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,

 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue"."In the afternoon they [the friends of the prisoners] being gone, we
guarded them [the prisoners] as before to the church, and after prayer,
gave them to Pocahuntas the King's Daughter, in regard of her father's
kindness in sending her: after having well fed them, as all the time of
their imprisonment, we gave them their bows, arrowes, or what else
they had, and with much content, sent them packing: Pocahuntas, also we
requited with such trifles as contented her, to tel that we had used the
Paspaheyans very kindly in so releasing them."The next allusion to her is in the fourth chapter of the narratives
which are appended to the "Map of Virginia," etc.This was sent home by
Smith, with a description of Virginia, in the late autumn of 1608.It
was published at Oxford in 1612, from two to three years after Smith's
return to England.The appendix contains the narratives of several of
Smith's companions in Virginia, edited by Dr.In one of these is a brief reference to the above-quoted
incident.This Oxford tract, it is scarcely necessary to repeat, contains no
reference to the saving of Smith's life by Pocahontas from the clubs of
Powhatan.The next published mention of Pocahontas, in point of time, is in
Chapter X. and the last of the appendix to the "Map of Virginia," and is
Smith's denial, already quoted, of his intention to marry Pocahontas.In this passage he speaks of her as "at most not past 13 or 14 years of
age."If she was thirteen or fourteen in 1609, when Smith left Virginia,
she must have been more than ten when he wrote his "True Relation,"
composed in the winter of 1608, which in all probability was carried to
England by Captain Nelson, who left Jamestown June 2d.The next contemporary authority to be consulted in regard to Pocahontas
is William Strachey, who, as we have seen, went with the expedition of
Gates and Somers, was shipwrecked on the Bermudas, and reached Jamestown
May 23 or 24, 1610, and was made Secretary and Recorder of the colony
under Lord Delaware.Of the origin and life of Strachey, who was a
person of importance in Virginia, little is known.The better impression
is that he was the William Strachey of Saffron Walden, who was married
in 1588 and was living in 1620, and that it was his grandson of the same
name who was subsequently connected with the Virginia colony.He was,
judged by his writings, a man of considerable education, a good deal of
a pedant, and shared the credulity and fondness for embellishment of the
writers of his time.His connection with Lord Delaware, and his part
in framing the code of laws in Virginia, which may be inferred from
the fact that he first published them, show that he was a trusted and
capable man.William Strachey left behind him a manuscript entitled "The Historie of
Travaile into Virginia Britanica, &c., gathered and observed as well by
those who went first thither, as collected by William Strachey, gent.,
three years thither, employed as Secretaire of State."How long he
remained in Virginia is uncertain, but it could not have been "three
years," though he may have been continued Secretary for that period, for
he was in London in 1612, in which year he published there the laws of
Virginia which had been established by Sir Thomas Gates May 24, 1610,
approved by Lord Delaware June 10, 1610, and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale
June 22, 1611.The "Travaile" was first published by the Hakluyt Society in 1849.When
and where it was written, and whether it was all composed at one time,
are matters much in dispute.The first book, descriptive of Virginia and
its people, is complete; the second book, a narration of discoveries in
America, is unfinished.That Strachey
made notes in Virginia may be assumed, but the book was no doubt written
after his return to England.[This code of laws, with its penalty of whipping and death for what are
held now to be venial offenses, gives it a high place among the Black
Codes.One clause will suffice:

"Every man and woman duly twice a day upon the first towling of the Bell
shall upon the working daies repaire unto the church, to hear divine
service upon pain of losing his or her allowance for the first omission,
for the second to be whipt, and for the third to be condemned to the
Gallies for six months.Likewise no man or woman shall dare to violate
the Sabbath by any gaming, publique or private, abroad or at home, but
duly sanctifie and observe the same, both himselfe and his familie, by
preparing themselves at home with private prayer, that they may be the
better fitted for the publique, according to the commandments of God,
and the orders of our church, as also every man and woman shall repaire
in the morning to the divine service, and sermons preached upon the
Sabbath day, and in the afternoon to divine service, and Catechism upon
paine for the first fault to lose their provision, and allowance for the
whole week following, for the second to lose the said allowance and also
to be whipt, and for the third to suffer death."]Was it written before or after the publication of Smith's "Map and
Description" at Oxford in 1612?The question is important, because
Smith's "Description" and Strachey's "Travaile" are page after page
literally the same.Commonly at that time
manuscripts seem to have been passed around and much read before they
were published.Purchas acknowledges that he had unpublished manuscripts
of Smith when he compiled his narrative.Did Smith see Strachey's
manuscript before he published his Oxford tract, or did Strachey enlarge
his own notes from Smith's description?It has been usually assumed
that Strachey cribbed from Smith without acknowledgment.If it were a
question to be settled by the internal evidence of the two accounts,
I should incline to think that Smith condensed his description from
Strachey, but the dates incline the balance in Smith's favor.Strachey in his "Travaile" refers sometimes to Smith, and always with
respect.It will be noted that Smith's "Map" was engraved and published
before the "Description" in the Oxford tract.Purchas had it, for he
says, in writing of Virginia for his "Pilgrimage" (which was published
in 1613):

"Concerning-the latter [Virginia], Capt.John Smith, partly by word
of mouth, partly by his mappe thereof in print, and more fully by a
Manuscript which he courteously communicated to mee, hath acquainted
me with that whereof himselfe with great perill and paine, had been
the discoverer."Strachey in his "Travaile" alludes to it, and pays a
tribute to Smith in the following: "Their severall habitations are more
plainly described by the annexed mappe, set forth by Capt.Smith, of
whose paines taken herein I leave to the censure of the reader to judge.Sure I am there will not return from thence in hast, any one who hath
been more industrious, or who hath had (Capt.Percie excepted)
greater experience amongst them, however misconstruction may traduce
here at home, where is not easily seen the mixed sufferances, both of
body and mynd, which is there daylie, and with no few hazards and hearty
griefes undergon."There are two copies of the Strachey manuscript.The one used by the
Hakluyt Society is dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon, with the title of
"Lord High Chancellor," and Bacon had not that title conferred on him
till after 1618.But the copy among the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford
is dedicated to Sir Allen Apsley, with the title of "Purveyor to His
Majestie's Navie Royall"; and as Sir Allen was made "Lieutenant of
the Tower" in 1616, it is believed that the manuscript must have been
written before that date, since the author would not have omitted the
more important of the two titles in his dedication.Strachey's prefatory letter to the Council, prefixed to his "Laws"
(1612), is dated "From my lodging in the Black Friars.At your best
pleasures, either to return unto the colony, or pray for the success of
it heere."In his letter he speaks of his experience in the Bermudas and
Virginia: "The full storie of both in due time [I] shall consecrate unto
your view.... Howbit since many impediments, as yet must detaine such
my observations in the shadow of darknesse, untill I shall be able to
deliver them perfect unto your judgments," etc.This is not, as has been assumed, a statement that the observations were
not written then, only that they were not "perfect"; in fact, they
were detained in the "shadow of darknesse" till the year 1849.Our
own inference is, from all the circumstances, that Strachey began his
manuscript in Virginia or shortly after his return, and added to it and
corrected it from time to time up to 1616.We are now in a position to consider Strachey's allusions to Pocahontas.The first occurs in his description of the apparel of Indian women:

"The better sort of women cover themselves (for the most part) all over
with skin mantells, finely drest, shagged and fringed at the skyrt,
carved and coloured with some pretty work, or the proportion of beasts,
fowle, tortayses, or other such like imagry, as shall best please or
expresse the fancy of the wearer; their younger women goe not shadowed
amongst their owne companie, until they be nigh eleaven or twelve
returnes of the leafe old (for soe they accompt and bring about the
yeare, calling the fall of the leaf tagnitock); nor are thev much
ashamed thereof, and therefore would the before remembered Pocahontas,
a well featured, but wanton yong girle, Powhatan's daughter, sometymes
resorting to our fort, of the age then of eleven or twelve yeares, get
the boyes forth with her into the markett place, and make them wheele,
falling on their hands, turning up their heeles upwards, whome she would
followe and wheele so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over;
but being once twelve yeares, they put on a kind of semecinctum lethern
apron (as do our artificers or handycrafts men) before their bellies,
and are very shamefac't to be seene bare.We have seene some use
mantells made both of Turkey feathers, and other fowle, so prettily
wrought and woven with threeds, that nothing could be discerned but the
feathers, which were exceedingly warme and very handsome."Strachey did not see Pocahontas.She did not resort to the camp after
the departure of Smith in September, 1609, until she was kidnapped by
Governor Dale in April, 1613.The
time mentioned by him of her resorting to the fort, "of the age then of
eleven or twelve yeares," must have been the time referred to by Smith
when he might have married her, namely, in 1608-9, when he calls her
"not past 13 or 14 years of age."The description of her as a "yong
girle" tumbling about the fort, "naked as she was," would seem to
preclude the idea that she was married at that time.The use of the word "wanton" is not necessarily disparaging, for
"wanton" in that age was frequently synonymous with "playful" and
"sportive"; but it is singular that she should be spoken of as "well
featured, but wanton."Strachey, however, gives in another place what is
no doubt the real significance of the Indian name "Pocahontas."He says:

"Both men, women, and children have their severall names; at first
according to the severall humor of their parents; and for the men
children, at first, when they are young, their mothers give them a name,
calling them by some affectionate title, or perhaps observing their
promising inclination give it accordingly; and so the great King
Powhatan called a young daughter of his, whom he loved well, Pocahontas,
which may signify a little wanton; howbeyt she was rightly called
Amonata at more ripe years."The polygamous Powhatan had a large
number of wives, but of all his women, his favorites were a dozen "for
the most part very young women," the names of whom Strachey obtained
from one Kemps, an Indian a good deal about camp, whom Smith certifies
was a great villain.Strachey gives a list of the names of twelve of
them, at the head of which is Winganuske.This list was no doubt written
down by the author in Virginia, and it is followed by a sentence,
quoted below, giving also the number of Powhatan's children.The
"great darling" in this list was Winganuske, a sister of Machumps,
who, according to Smith, murdered his comrade in the Bermudas.Strachey
writes:

"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian
Machumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us
as he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise
safe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes
knockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English
fort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often
reported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten
daughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a
great darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter
of his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a
private Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since."Does Strachey intend to say that
Pocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?She might have been
during the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping
in 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that
Powhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,
whom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to
be wife to a great chief.The term "private Captain" might perhaps be
applied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his "General Historie," says
the Indians have "but few occasions to use any officers more than one
commander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is
Captaine."It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.Mary went to the bedroom.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people."And mum's the word about the wager, or Captain Putnam will spoil
the whole affair if he gets wind of it.""I'd just like to lay hands on
about two quarts of chocolate cream.""There won't be any stakeholder," said Dick."But when is this kite-flying contest to come off?"The matter was talked over, and it was decided to wait until the
next Saturday, which would be, as usual, a half-holiday.In the
meantime some of the other boys heard there was going to be a
contest, although they knew nothing of the wager made, and half a
dozen other matches were arranged.Saturday proved to be cool and clear with a stiff breeze blowing
directly from the west.This being so, it was decided, in order
to get clear of the woods in front of the Hall, to hold the
contests on Baker's Plain, a level patch of ground some distance
to the westward.The cadets were soon on the way, shouting and laughing merrily
over the sport promised.Only a few remained behind, including
Jim Caven, who gave as his excuse that he had a headache."I'm glad he is not with us," said Dick."I declare, for some
reason, I can't bear to have him around.""It's queer, but he gives me the shivers
whenever he comes near me.""It's a wonder he came here at all.He doesn't belong in our
style of a crowd."To reach Baker's Plain the cadets had to make a detour around a
high cliff which overlooked a rocky watercourse which flowed into
Cayuga Lake.They moved slowly, as nobody wished to damage his
kite, and it was after two o'clock before all hands were ready for
the first trial at kite-flying."Sam, have you a good strong cord on your kite?""The strongest I could get," answered the youngest Rover."I
guess it is stronger than what Fred has.""My kite won't pull like yours," said Fred Garrison."Then up they go--and may the best kite win!"Soon a dozen kites of various kinds were soaring in the air, some
quite steadily and others darting angrily from side to side.One
went up with a swoop, to come down with a bang on the rocks, thus
knocking itself into a hundred pieces."Mine
Gretchen kite vos busted up--und I spent me feefteen cents on
him alreety!""You can help sail the Katydid.She will pull strong enough for two, I am sure."The Katydid was a wonderful affair of silver and gold which Dick
had constructed on ideas entirely his own.It went up slowly but
surely and proved to be as good a kite as the majority.A number of girls living in the neighborhood, bad heard of the
kite-flying contests, and now they came up, Dora Stanhope with the
rest, accompanied by her two cousins, Grace and Nellie Laning.As
my old readers may guess, Dick was very attentive to Dora, and his
brothers were scarcely less so to the two Laning sisters.Dick asked of Dora, during the course of
their conversation."She is much better," replied Dora, "although she is still weak
from her sickness.""Does she ever mention Josiah Crabtree?"She said that she had dreamed of him and
of you, Nick.""Oh--it was only a silly affair, Dick, not worth mentioning.""But I would like to know what it was.""Well, then, she dreamed that both of you were in a big forest and
he was about to attack you with a gun or a club, she couldn't tell
which.She awoke screaming and I ran to her side, and that is how
she told me of the dream."CHAPTER III

AN OLD ENEMY TURNS UP


"That was certainly an odd dream," said Dick, after a short pause."I am sure I never want to meet Josiah Crabtree under such
circumstances.""It was silly, Dick--I'd forget it if I was you.""And she never mentioned the man at any other time?"But I am certain she is glad he has left for parts unknown.I never, never, want to see him again," and the girl shivered."Don't be alarmed, Dora; I don't think he will dare to show
himself," answered Dick, and on the sly gave her hand a tight
squeeze.They were warmer friends than ever since Dick had
rescued her from those who had abducted her.The kite-flying was now in "full blast," as Sam expressed it, and
the boys had all they could do to keep the various lines from
becoming tangled up.His own kite and Fred's were side by side
and for a long time it looked as if neither would mount above the
other.cried several of the
cadets."Play out a bit more, Sam; you haven't given your kite all the
slack she wants," said others.So the talk ran on, while each
contestant did the best to make his kite mount higher.In the
meantime the wind kept increasing in violence, making each kite
pull harder than ever."It's a dandy for flying," panted Tom, who was holding his kite
with all the strength he possessed."Something must give way
soon," and something did give way.It was the string he was
holding, and as it snapped he went over on his back in such a
comical fashion that all, even to the girls, had to laugh."You should
have brought a stronger cord.""If I had I'd a-gone up in the clouds," answered Tom ruefully."That's the last of that kite, I suppose; if I--"

"The string has caught on Sam's kite!""Fred, your flying is
nowhere now.""He didn't calculate to fly one kite against two," answered Fred."Hold on, Sam, where are you going?"Oh, stop him somebody, before he goes over the cliff!""Don't go any closer to the
cliff!""Oh, dear, it's cutting me like a knife!""He's in a mess," came from Frank."If he isn't careful he'll go
over the cliff, as sure as he's born!"went on Dick, and, leaving his kite in Hans
Mueller's care, he ran after his brother.By this time Sam had gained a few bushes which grew but a dozen
feet away from the edge of the cliff, that at this point was
nearly forty feet in height.With his right hand held a painful
prisoner, he clutched at the bushes with his left."I've got the bushes, but I can't hold on long!"he panted, as
Dick came close.Scarcely had the words left his mouth when the bushes came up by
the roots and poor Sam fell over on his side.Then came another
strong puff of wind, and he was dragged to the very edge of the
rocky ledge!he screamed, when, making a mighty leap, Dick caught
him by the foot."If you
don't you'll be killed!""Oh, Dick, don't let me go
over!""I'll do my best, Sam," was Dick's answer, and he held on like
grim death.By this time half a dozen boys were running to the scene.Dora
Stanhope followed, and as she came up she pulled a tiny penknife
from her pocket."Can't I cut the line with this?"she asked, timidly, as she
pushed her way to Dick's side."Oh, my wrist is almost cut in
two!"Stooping low, Dora sawed away at the kite line, which was as taut
as a string on a bass fiddle.Suddenly there was a loud snap and
the cord parted.Sam and Dick fell back from the edge of the
cliff, while the entangled kites soared away for parts unknown."Thank Heaven you cut the line, Dora!"said Dick, who was the
first to recover from the excitement of the situation.He saw
that Dora was trembling like a leaf, and he hastened to her
support, but she pushed him away and pointed to Sam."Don't mind me--I am all right, Dick," she said."Here is my handkerchief; he had better bind it up with that,"
said Grace Laning, as she offered the article."We'll wash the wound first," put in Frank, and raced off for some
water.Soon he returned with his stiff hat full, and the cut on
Sam's wrist was tenderly washed by the Laning girls, who then
bound it up with the skill of a hospital surgeon.The kite-flying continued for the balance of the afternoon.But
Sam and Dick had had enough of it, and, along with Tom, they took
a stroll along the lake front with Dora Stanhope and Grace and
Nellie.Of course both boys and girls talked a whole lot of
nonsense, yet all enjoyed the walk very much."This is the spot where they abducted me," shivered Dora, as they
came to the old boathouse."Oh, what a dreadful time that was, to
be sure!""I don't believe our enemies will bother you any more, Dora," said
Dick."It's not likely that old Crabtree Will try the same game
twice; and Mumps has really turned over a new leaf and gone to
work for a living.""Yes, I was glad to hear that, for I don't believe he was such a
bad fellow at heart.He was under Dan Baxter's influence, just
as--as--"

"As Josiah Crabtree tried to influence your mother," whispered
Dick, and Dora nodded slowly."Well, let us forget it, and--My
gracious!"Dick stopped short, to stare in open-mouthed wonder at a small
boat shooting down the lake at a distance of several hundred yards
from the shore."Don't you see that fellow in the boat?"demanded Dick, in
increased wonder."Of course we see him," answered Tom."No; he's too far off," came from Sam..

"It's Dan Baxter!""It does look a little like Baxter," was Sam's slow comment."Yet
it seems impossible that he could be here, as Tom says.""I say it's Baxter," affirmed Dick stoutly,  "I'll hail him and
make sure.""Oh, don't bring him over here!"interposed Dora, becoming
alarmed."Don't be alarmed--he shan't hurt anybody, Dora."At first there was no reply, and the boy in the rowboat kept on
pulling.But as Dick repeated his call, the rower threw up his
oars."You mind your own business," he growled."Guess I can row on the
lake if I want to.""I wish my wrist wasn't so sore--I'd
go after him.""There's a boat below here," said Dick."He may--may shoot at you," faltered Dora."You know how wicked
he can be at times.""But he ought to be handed
over to the authorities.It is a crime to let him go free."Come over here; we want to talk to you!"growled the former bully of Putnam Hall."If you don't come we'll bring
you.""Hush, Sam, or you'll make a mess of things!"cried Dick softly,
but the warning came too late."Just try it on and
see how I'll fix you.""Come on for the boat," said Tom."We'll show him he can't scare
us."Sam was also about to
follow, when his elder brother stopped him."You can't do much with that sore wrist, Sam," he said."Better
stay with the girls until we come back.You can watch events from
the shore, and run for assistance, if it's necessary."Sam demurred at first, but soon saw the wisdom of  Dick's
reasoning and consented to remain behind.By this time Tom had shoved out the rowboat Dick had mentioned--a
neat craft belonging to a farmer living near.A pair of oars
lay in a locker on the lake bank; and, securing these, Tom leaped
on board of the craft, and soon Dick came after.Dan Baxter had watched their movement with interest, which
speedily gave way to arm when he saw the other boat come out, and
beheld Dick and Tom each take up an oar and begin to pull for all
they could."I was a clam to come up here, when there  is no real need for
it," he muttered.Well, I reckon I can put up a
pretty stiff fight if it comes to the worst."Then he caught up
his oars once more, and began to row down Cayuga Lake with all
possible speed.CHAPTER IV

THE CHASE ON THE LAKE


"He means to give us as much of a chase as possible," remarked
Tom, as he glanced over his shoulder."If I remember rightly,
Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman.""Yes, that was the one thing he could do well," returned Dick."But we ought to be able to catch him, Tom.""We could if we had two pairs of oars.One pair can do just about
so much and no more."Now, both together, and put all your muscle into it,"
and Dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with
difficulty.Baxter had been rowing down the lake, but as soon as he saw that
he was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore.He
was settled to his work, and for several minutes it was hard to
tell whether he was holding his own or losing.cried Dick, after pulling for five
minutes."Keep at it, Tom, and we'll have him before he is half
over.""Gosh, but it's hot work!""He
must be almost exhausted to row like that."He sees the prison cell staring
him in the face again.You'd do your best, too, if you were in
his place.""I'm doing my best now, Dick.Dick set a faster stroke than ever, having caught his
second wind, and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the
lake like a thing of life.The cry came from Baxter, while he was still a
hundred yards from the eastern shore."Keep off, or it will be
the worse for you!""We are not afraid of you, Baxter, and you ought to know it by
this time," answered Dick."You may as well give in now as later
on.""We are two to one, and you know what we have been able to do in
the past."I don't intend to go to jug again, and that is all there
is to it."Are you--going to keep off or not?"If you don't I--I'll shoot you."As Dan Baxter spoke he stopped rowing and brought from a hip
pocket a highly polished nickel-plated revolver.he demanded, as he pointed the weapon toward
the Rover boys.Both Dick and Tom were taken aback at the sight of the weapon.But they had seen such arms before, and had faced them,
consequently they were not as greatly alarmed as they right
otherwise have been.They knew, too, that Dan Baxter was a
notoriously bad shot."Put that up, Baxter," said Dick calmly."It may only get you
into deeper trouble.""I'm not going back to
jail and that is all there, is to it!""You won't dare to shoot at us, and you know it," put in Tom, as
the two boats drifted closer together."I will, and don't you fool yourself on it.""Drop those oars or I'll fire, as sure as my name is Dan Baxter,"
and the revolver, which had been partly lowered, was raised a
second time.It must be confessed that Dick and Tom were much disconcerted.The two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart, and any kind
of a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less
dangerous.Baxter's eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry
snake ready to strike."You think you are smart, you Rover boys," said the bully, after
an awkward pause all around."You think you did a big thing in
rescuing Dora Stanhope and in putting me and my father and Buddy
Girk in prison.But let me tell you that this game hasn't come to
an end yet, and some day we intend to square accounts.""There is no use in wasting breath in this fashion, Baxter,"
returned Dick, as calmly as he could."We are two to one, and the
best thing to do is for you to submit.If you fire on us, we may
do a little shooting on our own account."Do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion?You
haven't any pistol, and I know it.If you had you would have
drawn the weapon long ago.""Don't be too sure," he said steadily,
as the boats drifted still closer together."The minute I heard
you had escaped from jail I went and bought a pistol in
Cedarville."This was the strict truth, but Dick did not add that
the weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at
the Hall."Got afraid I'd come around, eh?""I knew there was nothing like becoming prepared.Now will you--"

Dick did not have time to finish, for, lowering the front end of
the pistol, Dan Baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports
rang out in quick succession.One bullet buried itself in the
seat beside Tom, while the second plowed its way through the
bottom, near the stern.cried Dick, and in his excitement hurled his oar at
Dan Baxter, hitting the fellow across the fact with such force
that the bully's nose began to bleed.The shock made Baxter lose
his hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and
sank immediately to the bottom of the lake."My, but that was a close shave!"muttered Tom, as he gazed at the
hole through the seat."A little closer and I would have got it
in the stomach."A yell now came from Sam, and a shriek from the girls, all of whom
had heard the pistol shots.They were too far away to see the
result of the shooting and feared both Tom and Dick had been
killed or wounded.As quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar, Dan
Baxter picked up his own blades, and without paying attention to
the blood which was flowing from his nose, began once again to
pull for the shore.shouted Dick, and then his face
fell."Confound it, I've thrown away my oar!And
he pointed some distance to their left."Look at that hole in
the bottom, made by that pistol shot.The water is coming in just
as fast as it can."There was small need to call attention to it, for the water in the
bottom of the boat was already an inch deep.Dick started in
perplexity, then, struck by a sudden idea, drew a lead pencil from
his pocket and rammed it into the opening.It fitted very well,
and the water ceased, to come in."Now we'll have to bail out and pick up that other oar," said Tom."It was foolish to throw it away, Dick."Paddle over, and I'll pick it up."Tom did so, and the blade was
speedily recovered.But Dan Baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by
the Rover boys, and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing
once more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on
the shore."I told you
that you couldn't catch me.The next time we meet I'll make you
sorry that you ever followed me," and he started to run off with
all possible speed.Tom and Dick were too chagrined to answer him, and pulled forward
to the shore in silence.They ran the craft into some bushes and
tied up, and then started after Baxter, who was now making for the
woods south of the village of Nelson.When the highway skirting this portion of Cayuga Lake was gained
Dan Baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them.A turn in
the road soon hid him from view.Gaining the bend they discovered
that he had disappeared from view altogether."He has taken to the woods," sighed Dick."If that is so we may as well give the hunt up," answered his
brother."It would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack,
for we wouldn't know what direction he had taken.""I wish I had a bloodhound with which to trail him.He ought to
be run down, Tom.""Well, let us notify some of the people living near and see what
can be done."They ran on to the spot where they supposed Baxter had left the
highway.On both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy
underbrush.All in all, the locality formed an ideal hiding
place.Night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse.Here they found three men, to whom they explained the situation."If he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him,"
was the comment from Farmer Mason."If he ain't careful he'll
lose himself so completely he'll never git out, b'gosh!""Well, I don't know but what that would suit me," responded Tom
dryly.The search was begun, and several others joined in.It lasted
until night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in
disgust."But we ought to notify the authorities," said Tom."They will
probably put a detective on his track.""Yes; but a detective can't do any more than we can, up in this
wild locality.""He won't remain in the woods forever."Well, we can send the police a telegram from Cedarville."This was done, and the Rover boys returned to Putnam Hall by way
of the side road leaving past the homes of the Stanhopes and the
Lanings.They found Sam and the girls very anxious concerning
their welfare."We were afraid you had been shot," said Dora."But it's too bad that Baxter got away.I
wonder where he will turn up next."They all wondered, but could not even venture an answer.Soon the
boys left the girls and hurried to the academy, where their story,
had to be told over again.Captain Putnam looked exceedingly
grave over the narrative."You must be careful in the future, lads," he said."Remember,
you are in my care here.I do not know what your uncle would say
if anything should happen to you.""We will be on our guard in the future," answered Dick."But I am
awfully sorry we didn't catch him.""So am I.  But perhaps the authorities will have better luck," and
there the talk came to an end, and the boys retired for the night.CHAPTER V

FUN AND AN EXPLOSION


Several days slipped by, and the boys waited anxiously for some
news from the authorities.But none came, and they rightfully
surmised that, for the time being, Dan Baxter had made good his
escape.On account of the disastrous ending to the kite-flying match, many
had supposed that the feast in Dormitory No.6 was not to come
off, but Sam, Tom, Frank, and several others got their heads
together and prepared for a "layout" for the following Wednesday,
which would be Dick's birthday."We'll give him a surprise," said Sam, and so it was agreed.Passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter,
and Tom, Sam, and Fred Garrison were delegated to purchase the
candies, cake, and ice cream which were to constitute the spread."We'll do the thing up brown," said Sam."We must strike higher than that feast we had, last year."came from Tom, "Oh dear, do you remember how we
served Mumps that night!"and he set up a roar over the
remembrance of the scene.Hans Mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory, and
he was as much, interested as anybody in the preparations for the
spread."I like to have von feast
twist a veek, ha I ha!"He's a jolly dog," said Tom to Frank."But, say, I've been thinking of having some fun with him before
this spread comes off.""Let me in on the ground floor," pleaded Frank, who always wok a
great interest in Tom's jokes."I will, on one condition, Frank.""That you loan me that masquerade suit you have in your trunk.The one you used at that New Year's dance at home.""Hullo, I reckon I smell a mouse!""I
heard you giving Hans that yarn about us training to fight
Indians."'"I did indeed; and I heard Hans say that he wanted nothing to do
with the Indians.""Well, he's going to have something to do with at least one
Indian," grinned Tom."What do you say I get the suit?""Yes; if you'll fix it so that I can see the sport.""All of the crowd can see it, if they don't leak about it,"
returned the fun-loving Rover.Tom soon had the masquerade suit in his possession and also, some
face paints which Frank had saved from the New Year's dance mentioned.Shortly afterward Tom joined the crowd in the gymnasium, where
Hans Mueller was trying to do some vaulting over the bars."I dink I could chump dem sticks of I vos taller," the German
youth was saying."Or the sticks were lower," replied Tom, with a wink at the crowd."That's right, Hans, you had better learn how to jump now, and to
run, too.""The Indians have come," put in Frank."They say a band of them are in the woods around here," answered
Tom."If you go out you want to be careful or they may scalp
you.""Cracious, Rofer, ton't say dot!""Vot is
dem Indians doing here annavay?""They came in East to hunt up some buffalo that got away.They
had something like half a million in a corral, and about two
thousand got away from them."This preposterous announcement was taken by Hans Mueller in all
seriousness, and he asked Tom all sorts of ridiculous questions
about the savage red men, whom he supposed as wild and wily as
those of generations ago."No, I ton't vonts to meet any of dem," he said at last."Da vos
von pad lot alretty!""That's right, Hans, you give them a wide berth," said Tom, and
walked away.Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if he would not walk down
to Cedarville for him, to buy him a baseball.Eager to be
accommodating, the German youth received the necessary permission
to leave the academy acres and hurried off at the full speed of
his sturdy legs.cried Tom, and ran off for the Indian suit and
the face paints.These he took down to the bam and set to work to
transform himself into a wild-looking red man.grinned Peleg Snuggers, who stood watching
him."We never had such a lad as you before Master Thomas.""Thanks, Peleg, and perhaps you'll never have one like me again--and
then you'll be dreadfully sorry.""Mum's the word, old man.""Oh, I never say nuthin, Master Thomas; you know that," returned
the man-of-all-work.A number of the other pupils had been let into the secret, and,
led by Dick, they ran off to the woods lining the Cedarville road.Tom came after them, skulking along that nobody driving by might
catch sight of him.Not quite an hour later Hans Mueller was heard coming back.The
German boy was humming to himself and at the same time throwing up
the new ball he had purchased for Dick.thundered out Tom, as he leaped from behind a big
tree."Dutcha boy heap big scalp-me take um!And he
danced up to Hans, flourishing a big tin knife as he did so.The
masquerade was a perfect one, and he looked like an Indian who had
just stepped forth from some Wild West show.screamed Hans, as he stopped short and grew white."It's dem Indians come to take mine hair!Oh, please, Mister
Indian, ton't vos touch me!""Dutcha boy heap nice hair," continued Tom, drawing nearer."Maka
nice door-mat for Big Wolf."No, no; ton't vos touch mine hair-it vos all der hair I vos got!""Please, Mister Indian mans, let me go!"bellowed Tom, drawing forth a
rusty pistol he had picked up in the barn.This rusty pistol had
done lots of duty at fun-making before.Then he fell on his knees
in despair.Tom could scarcely keep from laughing at the sight, and a snicker
or two could be heard coming from where Frank, Dick, and the
others were concealed behind the bushes.But the German youth was
too terrorized to notice anything but that awful red man before
him, with his hideous war-paint of blue and yellow."Dutcha boy dance for Big Wolf," went on Tom.And the fun-loving Rover set the pace in a mad,
caper that would have done credit to a Zulu.faltered Hans, and then, thinking he might
appease the wrath of his unexpected enemy he began to caper about
in a clumsy fashion which was comical in the extreme."Dutcha boy take the cake for
flingin' hees boots.Faster, faster, or Big Wolf shoot, bang!""No, no; I vos dance so hard as I can!"panted Hans, and renewed
his exertions until Tom could keep in no longer, and set up such a
laugh as had not been heard around the Hall for many a day.It is
needless to add that the other boys joined in, still, however,
keeping out of sight."You're a corker, Hans!""You
ought to join the buck-and-wing dancers in a minstrel company."began the German boy in bewilderment."To be sure I am; I'm Big Wolf, the Head Dancing Master of the
Tuscaroras, Hans, dear boy.Don't you think I'm a stunner.""You vos Tom Rofer, made up," growled Hans in sudden and deep
disgust."Vot for you vos blay me such a drick as dis, hey?""I ton't vos been asleep, not me!""I mean to stir up your ideas--put something new into your
head.""Mine head vos all right, Tom.""Den vot you say you vos put somedings new py him, hey?""I mean to make you sharper-put you on your mettle.""I ton't understand," stammered the German youth hopelessly."That's so, and you won't in a thousand years, Hans.But you are
the right sort, any way.""I dink  I blay me Indian mineselluf some tay," mused Hans."Dot
vos lots of fun to make me tance, vosn't it?Vere you got dot
bistol?"Look out, or it may go off," added Tom, as he
held out the weapons, thinking Hans would draw back in alarm.Instead, however, the German boy took the pistol and of a sudden
pointed it at Tom's head."Tance, or I vos shoot you
full of holes!""Hi, Tom; he's got the best of you now!""You can't make me dance, Hans," returned Tom."That old rusty
iron hasn't been loaded for years.""It ton't vos no goot?"Pull the trigger and see," answered Tom coolly.He had scarcely spoken when Hans Mueller did as advised.A
tremendous report followed, and when the smoke cleared away the
boys in the bushes were horrified to see that the rusty pistol had
been shattered into a thousand pieces and that both Tom and Hans
lay on their backs in the road, their faces covered with blood.CHAPTER VI

THE STRANGE FIGURE IN THE HALLWAY


At the fearful outcome of the joke Tom had been perpetrating the
boys concealed in the bushes were almost struck dumb, and for
several seconds nobody could speak or move."Oh, Heavens, Tom is killed!"burst out Dick, who was the first to
find his voice.He ran forth as speedily as possible, and one
after another the other cadets followed.Tom lay as quiet as death, with his eyes closed and the blood
trickling over his temple and left cheek.Quickly Dick knelt by
his side and felt of his heart.But no answer came back, and Sam raced off to get some water,
which he brought in a tin can he had discovered lying handy.The
water was dashed over Toni's face, and presently he gave a little
gasp.he murmured, and then tried to sit up,
but for the minute the effort was a failure."A piece must have hit you on
the head," and he pointed at a nasty scalp wound from which the
flow of blood emanated.As well as it could be done, Frank and Dick bound up Tom's head
with a handkerchief, and presently the fun-loving lad declared
himself about as well as ever, "Only a bit light-headed," as he
added.In the meantime the others had given their attention to Hans, who
had been struck both in the scalp and in the shoulder.It was a
good quarter of an hour before the German youth came around, and
then he felt so weak that the boys had to assist him back to the
academy."Honestly, I thought the pistol was empty," said Tom, on the
return to the Hall."Why, I think I've pulled that trigger a
dozen times.""Don't mention it," said Frank with a shiver."Why, only last
week I pointed the thing at Peleg Snuggers and played at firing
it.Supposing it had gone off and killed somebody?""Dot vos almost as pad as von Indian's schalping," put in Hans
faintly."I dink, Tom, you vos play no more such dricks, hey?""No, I've had enough," replied Tom very soberly."If you had been
killed or seriously hurt I would never have forgiven myself."And
it may be added here that for some time after this event
fun-making and Tom were strangers to each other.At the proper time the feast which had been planned came off, and
proved to be an event not readily forgotten.It was no easy
matter to obtain the good things required, and the boys ran the
risk of being discovered by George Strong and punished; but by
midnight everything was ready, and soon eating was "in full
blast," to use Sam's way of expressing it.A few of the boys from the other dormitories had been invited, and
the boys took turns in standing out in the hall on guard."You see," explained Tom, "Mr.Strong may come in, and I won't be
able to play nightmare again, as I did last year.""Say, but that was a prime joke," laughed Frank."I'll never forget the orange flavored
with kerosene," and a general laugh followed.Somebody had spoken of inviting Jim Caven to the feast, but no one
cared particularly for the fellow, and he had been left out."Perhaps he'll tell on us," suggested Larry, but Frank shook his
head."He hasn't got backbone enough to do it.He's a worse coward than
Mumps was."Soon it came time for Sam to do his turn at guarding, and stuffing
a big bit of candy in his mouth, the youngest Rover stepped out
into the dimly lit hallway and sat down on a low stool which one
of the guards had placed there.For ten or fifteen minutes nothing occurred to disturb Sam, and he
was just beginning to think that watching was all nonsense when he
saw a dark figure creeping along the wall at the extreme lower end
of the hallway, where it made a turn toward the back stairs.He continued to watch the figure, and now saw that it was dressed
in a black suit and had what looked like a shawl over its head."That's queer," went on the boy."What can that man or boy be up
to?"Presently the figure turned and entered one of the lower
dormitories, closing the door gently behind it.Then it came out
again and made swiftly for the rear of the upper hallway.By
this time Sam was more curious than ever, and as the figure
disappeared around the bend by the back stairs he followed on
tiptoes.But as what light there was came from the front, the rear was very
dark, and the youth could see little or nothing.He heard a door
close and the lock click, but whether or not it was upstairs or
down he could not tell.For several minutes he remained in the rear hallway, and then he
went back to his post.Soon Tom came out to relieve him, and Sam
re-entered the dormitory and told his story to the others."That's certainly odd," was Dick's comment

"Was it a man or a boy, Sam?"If it wasn't a man it was a pretty big
boy.""Perhaps we ought to report the matter to Captain Putnam,"
suggested Frank."That person may have been around the hallways
for no good purpose."perhaps it was somebody who was trying to spy on us,"
put in Fred."If we tell the captain we will only be exposing
ourselves, and I guess you all know what that means.""It means half-holidays cut off for a month," said Dick."Besser you vait und see vot comes of dis," said Hans, and after a
little more talk this idea prevailed, and then the boys went in to
clear up what was left of the feast.Everything was gone but a
little ice-cream, and it did not take long to dispose of this.Sam was bound to have some fun, and instead of eating his last
mouthful of cream he awaited a favorable opportunity and dropped
it down inside of Fred's collar.That's worse than a chunk of
ice!"Go down and sit on the kitchen stove," suggested Dick.I'll sit on Sam's head if I get the chance!"roared Fred, and made a rush for Sam.A scuffle ensued, which
came to a sudden end as both sent a washstand over with a loud
crash."That's noise enough to wake
the dead.""Do you want to bring the captain down on us at the last minute?""Clear up that muss, both of you," said Dick to Sam and Fred.It was Sam's fault--he started the racket."I reckon we had best dust," said one of the boys from another
dormitory."I hear somebody coming already,"
and in a twinkle the outsiders ran for their various quarters,
leaving the occupants of Dormitory No.6 to fix up matters as best
they could.It was no easy job to straighten out the washstand, clear up the
general muss, and disrobe.But the boys were on their mettle, and
in less than two minutes the light was out and all were under the
covers, although, to be sure, Sam had his shoes still on and Tom
was entirely clothed."Boys, what is the row up here?"The call came from Captain
Putnam himself.He was ascending the front stairs, lamp in hand,
and attired in a long dressing gown.As no one answered, he paused in the upper hallway and asked the
question again.Then he looked into one dormitory after another.Well, see that you don't wake up again as soon
as my back is turned," he went on, and soon after walked below
again, a faint smile on his features.He knew that boys were
bound to be more or less mischievous, no matter how strict his
regulations."I'll tell you what, the captain's a brick!"whispered Tom, as he
began to disrobe noiselessly."You wouldn't catch old Crabtree
acting that way.He'd have bad every cadet out of bed and sent
half a dozen of us down to the guard-room.""I guess the captain remembers when he was a cadet himself,"
remarked Dick."I've heard that they cut up some high pranks at
West Point.""George Strong would be just as kind," came from Tom."But say, I
am growing awfully tired.""So am I," came from several others,

Then the good-night word was passed, and soon all of the cadets
were sound asleep, never dreaming of the surprise which awaited
them in the morning.CHAPTER VII

WHO WAS GUILTY?"Boys, I've had my trunk looted!""And I've had my trousers' pockets picked!""And the half-dollar I left on the bureau is gone!"Such were some of the excited exclamations which the Rover boys
heard when they went downstairs the next morning.The speakers
were the youths who occupied Dormitories Numbers 3 and 4, at the
rear of the main upper hall.An inquiry among the lads elicited
the information that everybody had suffered excepting one boy, who
said he had not had any money on hand."I spent my last cent for the spread," he grinned."I guess I'm
the lucky one."The news of the robberies created a profound sensation throughout
Putnam Hall, and both Captain Putnam and George Strong were very
much disturbed."We never had such a thing occur before," said the captain, and he
ordered a strict investigation.All told, something like thirty-two dollars were missing, and also
a gold watch, a silver watch, and several shirt-studs of more or
less value.Among the shirt-studs was one set with a ruby
belonging to a cadet named Weeks.The robbery had
been committed during the night, while the owners of the money and
the various articles slept."I must get at the bottom of this affair," said Captain Putnam."The honor of the academy is at stake."He talked to all of those who had lost anything and promised to
make the matter good.Then he asked each if he had any suspicions
regarding the thief or thieves.No one had, and for the time
being it looked as if the case must fall to the ground.Those who had been at the feast hardly knew what to say or to do.Should they tell the captain of the strange figure Sam had seen in
the hallway?"I'll tell him, and shoulder the blame, if you fellows are
willing," said Sam, after a long discussion."Fun is one thing,
and shielding a thief is another.""You do not know that that
person, was the thief.""More than likely he was," came from Dick."And if he was, who was he?""If you tell Captain
Putnam you'll simply get us all into trouble.""I vote that Sam makes a clean breast of it," said Frank, and
Larry said the same.This was just before dinner, and immediately
after the midday meal had been finished the youngest Rover went up
to the master of the Hall and touched him on the arm."I would like to speak to you in private and at once, Captain
Putnam," he said."Very well, Rover; come with me," was the reply, and Captain
Putnam led the way to his private office."I suppose I should have spoken of this before," said Sam, when
the two were seated."But I didn't want to get the others into
trouble.As it is, Captain Putnam, I want to take the entire blame
on my own shoulders.""Of what I am going to tell you about.We voted to tell you, but
I don't want to be a tattle-tale and get the others into trouble
along with me.""I will hear what you have to say," returned the master of the Hall
briefly."Well, sir, you know it was Dick's birthday yesterday, and we boys
thought we would celebrate a bit.So we had a little blow-out in
our room.""Was that the noise I heard last night?""The noise you heard was from our room, yes.But that isn't what
I was getting at," stammered Sam."We set a guard out in the
hallway to keep watch.""I was out in the hall part of the time, and I saw a dark figure
in the rear hallway prowling around in a most suspicious manner.3 and then came out and disappeared
toward the back stairs.""A man, sir, or else a big boy.He had something like a shawl
over his shoulders and was dressed in black or dark-brown.""You saw him go in and come out of one of the sleeping rooms?""And then he went down the back stairs?""He either went down the stairs or else into one of the back
rooms.I walked back after a minute or two, but I didn't see
anything more of him, although I heard a door close and heard a
key turn in a lock.""Was this before I came up or after?"We went to sleep right after you came up."And now Captain Putnam prepared to
write down the names."Oh, sir; I hope you won't--won't--"

"I'll have to ask you for the names, Samuel.I want to know who
was on foot last night as well as who was robbed.""Surely you don't think any of us was guilty?""I--I think I'll have to refuse to give them, Captain Putnam.""Of course all the boys who sleep in your dormitory were present?""I said I would take this all on my own shoulders, Captain Putnam.Of course, you know I wouldn't have confessed at all; but I don't
wish to give that thief any advantage.""Perhaps the person wasn't a thief at all, only some other cadet
spying upon you.""You may as well give me the names.Hardly knowing whether or not he was doing right, Sam mentioned
all of the cadets who had taken part in the feast.This list
Captain Putnam compared with another containing the names of those
who had been robbed."Thirty-two pupils," he mused."I'll have the whole, school in
this before I finish."The youth wondered what was coming
next, when there was a sudden knock on the door."Come in," said
Captain Putnam, and one of the little boys entered with a letter
in his hand.Strong sent me with this," said the young cadet."He just
found it on the desk in the main recitation room.""All right, Powers; thank you," answered the captain, and took the
letter."You can go," and Powers retired again.The letter was encased in a dirty, envelope on which was printed
in a big hand, in lead pencil:

"CAPT.Taking up a steel blade, the master of the Hall cut open the
envelope and took out the slip of paper it contained.Then he crushed the paper in his
hand and looked sharply at Sam."Samuel, was the party you saw in the hall-way tall and slim?""No; it was too dark for that, and, besides, he had that shawl, or
whatever it was, pretty well up around him.""By the way, you of course know Alexander Pop, our 
waiter."Everybody knows Aleck, and we have had lots of
fun with him, at one time or another.But you surely don't
suspect him, do you?"It contains but two lines, and you can read it
for yourself," and the captain handed over the communication,
which ran as follows:

"Alexander Pop stole that money and the other things."That's a mighty queer letter for anybody to write," murmured Sam,
as he handed it back."Why didn't the writer come to you, as I
have done?""Perhaps he wanted to keep out of trouble.""I don't believe the letter tells the truth, sir.""Because Aleck is too good-hearted a fellow to turn thief.""Well, why don't you have him searched?"Without further ado Sam was dismissed, and Captain Putnam called
George Strong to him and showed the strange letter."He
may have hidden the money and jewelry in his trunk.""We will go up to his apartment," replied Captain Putnam, and a
few minutes later the pair ascended to the attic room which the
 waiter had used for several terms.They found Pop just
fixing up for a trip to Cedarville.He nodded pleasantly, and then looked at both questioningly."Pop, I am afraid I have a very unpleasant duty to perform," began
Captain Putnam."You have heard of the robberies that have been committed?"But--but yo' don't go fo' to distrust me, do
yo', cap'n?"went on the <DW52> man anxiously."I would like to search your trunk and your clothing, Pop.If you
are innocent you will not object.""But, sah, I didn't steal nuffin, sah.""It aint right nohow to'spect an honest  pusson, sah,"
said Aleck, growing angry.I am not guilty, sah, an' dis am not treatin' me jest
right, sah, 'deed it aint, sah.""If you object, Pop, I will be under the painful necessity of
having Snuggers place you under arrest.You know he is a special
officer for the Hall."At this announcement Aleck fell back completely dumfounded."Well, dat's de wust yet!"he muttered, and sank back on a chair,
not knowing what to do next.CHAPTER VIII

IN WHICH ALEXANDER POP RUNS AWAY


"Will you submit to having your trunk examined or not?"demanded
Captain Putnam, after a painful pause, during which Alexander
Pop's eyes rolled wildly from one teacher to the other."Yo' kin examine it if yo' desire," said Aleck."But it's an
outrage, Cap'n Putnam, an' outrage, sah!"Without more ado Captain Putnam approached the waiter's trunk, to
find it locked."Dare, sah, on de nail alongside ob yo' sah."Soon the trunk was unlocked and the lid thrown back.The box
contained a miscellaneous collection of wearing apparel, which the
captain pushed to one side.Then he brought out a cigar box
containing some cheap jewelry and other odds and ends, as well as
two five dollar bills."Dat money am mine, sah," said Aleck."Yo paid me dat las'
Saturday, sall.""That is true, but how did this get here, Pop?"As Captain Putnam paused he held up a stud set with a ruby-the
very stud the cadet Weeks had lost!"Dat--dat stud--I never seen dat shirt-stud before, cap'n,
'deed I didn't," stammered the waiter."That is certainly Weeks' stud; I remember it well," put in George
Strong."He showed it to me one day, stating it was a gift from
his aunt.""And here is a cheap watch," added Captain Putnam, bringing forth
the article."No, sah--I--I never seen dat watch before," answered Aleck
nervously."I dun reckon sumbuddy put up a job on dis poah <DW53>,
sah," he continued ruefully."I believe the job was put up by yourself," answered Captain
Putnam sternly."If you are guilty you had better confess."Alexander Pop stoutly declared
himself innocent, but in the face of the proofs discovered the
master of the Hall would not listen to him."Peleg Snuggers shall take you in charge and drive down to the
Cedarville lock-up," said the captain.The news that some of the things had been found in Pop's trunk
spread with great rapidity.Many were astonished to learn that he
was thought guilty, but a few declared that "a <DW53> wasn't to be
trusted anyway.""<DW65>s are all thieves," said Jim Caven, "never yet saw an
honest one.""Pop's a first-rate fellow,
and the captain has got to have more proof against him before I'll
believe him guilty.""You only say that because he called you down last week," put in
Frank.He referred to a tilt between the new pupil and the
<DW52> man.Jim Caven had tried to be "smart" and had gotten the
worst of the encounter."Yes, I think he's as honest as you are!"burst out Tom, before he
had stopped to think twice.roared Jim Caven, and leaped upon
Tom, with his face as white as the wall."I'll make you smart for
that!"One blow landed on Tom's cheek and another was about to follow,
when Tom dodged and came up under Caven's left arm.Then the two
boys faced each other angrily.cried a number of the cadets, and in a twinkle
a ring was formed around the two contestants."I'm going to give you the worst thrashing you ever had," said
Caven, but in rather a nervous tone."All right, Caven, go ahead and do it," cried Tom."I will stand
up for Aleck Pop, and there you are!"Tom launched forth and caught Caven on the right cheek.The Irish
lad also struck out, but the blow fell short.And
he held Tom with one hand and hit him in the neck with the other.The blow was a telling one, and for a brief instant Tom was dazed.But then he caught his second wind and threw Caven backward.Before the Irish lad could recover his balance, Tom struck him
in the nose, and over rolled his opponent.gasped Jim Caven, as soon as he could speak.and staggering to his feet, he glanced around for
some weapon.Nothing met his view but a garden spade which Peleg
Snuggers had been using, and catching this up he ran for Tom as if
to lay him low forever."He shan't call me a thief!"And he aimed a tremendous blow for Tom's head.Had the spade fallen as intended Tom's cranium might have been split
in twain.But now both Dick and Frank caught the unreasonable youth
and held him while Sam and several others took the spade away.came the unexpected cry from
some outsiders."Yes, give it up, Tom," whispered Sam."We're in hot water enough, on account of that feast.""I'll give it up if Caven is willing," muttered

"I'll meet you another time," answered Caven, and walked rapidly
away.demanded George Strong, as he strode up."Nothing, sir," said one of the boy."Some of the fellows were
wrestling for possession of that spade.""Oh, I was afraid there was a fight," and Mr.He was on his way to the barn, and presently the cadets saw him
come forth with the man-of-fall-work and the light spring wagon."They are going to take poor Aleck to the Cedarville lock-up,"
announced Fred."Poor chap, I never thought this of him!""To me this affair isn't very clear.""I don't believe they will be able to convict him of the crime,"
put in Sam.An hour later Peleg Snuggers started away from Putnam Hall with
his prisoner.Aleck looked the picture of misery as he sat on a
rear seat, his wrists bound together and one leg tied to the wagon
seat with a rope."Dis am a mistake," he groaned.Some of the boys wished to speak to him, but this was not
permitted."You may think I am hard with him," said Captain Putnam, later on,
"but to tell the truth he does not come from a very good family
and he has a step-brother already in prison.""Aleck can't be held responsible for his stepbrother's doings,"
murmured Tom, but not loud enough for the master to hear him.A diligent search had been made for the other stolen articles, but
nothing more was brought to light.If Pop had taken the things he
had either hidden them well or else disposed of them.It was nearly nightfall when Peleg Snuggers drove back to the
Hall.Dick and Tom met him just outside the gates and saw that
the man-of-all-work looked much dejected."Well, Peleg, is he safe in jail?""No, he ain't," was the snappy reply."Why, what did you do with him?"I didn't do nuthin--not me.It was him as did it all--cut
that blessed rope and shoved me over the dashboard on to the
hosses!""Do you mean to say he got away from you?""Yes, he did--got away like a streak o' fightnin', thet's wot he
did, consarn him!"And without another word Peleg drove to the
rear of the Hall, put his team in the barn, and went in to report
to Captain Putnam.Another row resulted, and this nearly cost the utility Man his
position.But it appeared that he was not so much to blame that
Alexander Pop had taken him unawares and finally he was sent away
to his work with the caution to be more careful in the future.Before night and during the next day a hunt was made for the
<DW52> man, but he had left the vicinity entirely, gone to New
York, and shipped on one of the outward-bound ocean vessels.The
Rover boys fancied that they would never see him again, but in
this they were mistaken.CHAPTER IX

THE ROVER BOYS ON WHEELS


"Say, fellows, but this is the greatest sport yet!""I feel like flying, Tom," said Dick Rover."I never thought
wheeling was so grand."It was several weeks later, and the scholars were having a
half-holiday.Just six days before, Randolph Rover had surprised
his three nephews by sending each a handsome bicycle, and it had
taken them hardly any time to learn how to handle the machines."Let us take a ride over to Chardale," said Dick."I understand
that the roads are very good in that direction.""All right, I'm willing," answered Sam, and Tom said the same.Soon the three brothers were on the way, Dick leading and Tom and
Sam coming behind, side by side.It was an ideal day for cycling, cool and clear, and the road they
had elected to take was inviting to the last degree, with its
broad curves, its beautiful trees, and the mountainous views far
to the north and west."It's a wonder we didn't get wheels before," observed Dick."This
beats skating or riding a to bits.""Just you look out that you don't take a header!""This road is all right, but a loose stone might do a pile of
damage.""I've got my eye on the road," answered his big brother."For the
matter of that, we'll all have to keep our eyes open."To reach Chardale they had to cross several bridges and then
descend a long hill, at the foot of which ran the railroad to
several towns north and south.With a laugh, Sam tried
to catch up to him, but could not.went on the
fun-loving Rover, as the hill was gained, and on he started, his
wheel flying faster and faster as yard after yard was covered."I took it off entirely this
morning."This reply had scarcely reached Dick's ears when another sound
came to him which disturbed him greatly.Far away he heard the whistle of a locomotive as it came around
the bottom of the hill.Looking in the direction, he saw the puff
of smoke over the treetops.He tried to cry out, but now the road was rather rough, and he had
to pay strict attention 'to where he was riding."Tom's going to get into trouble," gasped Sam, as he ranged up
alongside of his elder brother."The road crosses the railroad
tracks just below here."As Dick finished he saw a chance to stop and at once dismounted.Then he yelled at the top of his lungs:

"Tom, stop!Stop, or you'll run into the railroad train!"Sam also came to a halt and set up a shout.But Tom was now
speeding along like the wind and did not hear them.Nearer and nearer he shot to the railroad tracks.Then the
whistle of the locomotive broke upon his ears and he turned pale."I don't want to run into that train," he muttered, and tried to
bring his bicycle to a halt.But the movement did not avail without a brake, and so he was
compelled to seek for some side path into which he might guide his
machine.the road was hemmed in with a heavy woods on one side
and a field of rocks on the other.A sudden stop, therefore,
would mean a bad spill, and Tom had no desire to break his bones
by any such proceeding.Nearer and nearer he drew to the railroad crossing.He could now
hear the puffing of the engine quite plainly and caught a glimpse
of the long train over the rocks to his left.On he bounded until
the crossing itself came into view.He was less than a hundred
yards from it--and the oncoming engine was about the same
distance away!There are some moments in one's life that seem hours, and the
present fraction of time was of that sort to poor Tom.He had a
vision of a terrific smash-up, and of Dick and Sam picking up his
lifeless remains from the railroad tracks.he
muttered, and then, just before the tracks were reached, he made
one wild, desperate leap in the direction of a number of bushes
skirting the woods.He turned over and over, hit hard--and for
several seconds knew no more.When Dick and Sam came up they found Tom sitting in the very midst
of the bushes.The bicycle lay among the rocks with the handle-bars
and the spokes of the front wheel badly twisted.asked his big brother sympathetically,
yet glad to learn that Tom had not been ground to death under the
train, which had now passed the crossing."I don't know if I'm hurt or not," was the'slow answer, as Tom
held his handkerchief to his nose, which was bleeding."I tried to plow up these bushes with my head, that's all.I guess
my ankle is sprained, too.""You can't ride that wheel any further," announced Sam.I've had enough, for a few days at least."It was a good quarter of an hour before Tom felt like standing up.Then he found his ankle pained him so much that walking was out of
the question."I'm sure I don't know what I am going to do," he said ruefully."I can't walk and I can't ride, and I don't know as I can stay
here.""Perhaps Dick and I can carry you to Hopeton," said Sam,
mentioning a small town just beyond the railroad tracks.Perhaps the
driver of that will give me a lift."As Tom finished a large farm wagon rattled into sight, drawn by a
pair of bony horses and driven by a tall, lank farmer."Hullo, wot's the matter?"asked the farmer, as he drew rein."No, I've had a smash-up," answered Tom."My brother's ankle is sprained, and we would like to know if you
can give him a lift to the next town," put in Dick."We'll pay you
for your trouble.""That's all right--Seth Dickerson is allers ready to aid a
fellow-bein' in distress," answered the farmer."Can ye git in
the wagon alone?"Tom could not, and the farmer and Dick carried him forward and
placed him on the seat.Then the damaged bicycle was placed in
the rear of the turnout, and Seth Dickerson drove off, while Sam
and Dick followed on their steeds of steel."I see you air dressed in cadet uniforms," remarked the farmer, as
the party proceeded on its way."Be you fellers from Pornell
school?""No; we come from Putnam Hall," answered Tom."Oh, yes--'bout the same thing, I take it.How is matters up to
the school--larnin' a heap?""We are trying to learn all we have to.""Had some trouble up thar, didn't ye?My wife's brother was
a-tellin' me about it.A darkey stole some money an' watches, an'
that like.""They think he stole them," said Tom."Why don't Captain Putnam hunt around them air pawnshops fer the
watches?"went on Seth Dickerson, after a pause."The thief would most likely pawn 'em, to my way of thinkin'.""He hasn't much of a chance to do that.But I presume the police
will keep their eyes open.""I was over to Auburn yesterday--had to go to see about a
mortgage on our farm--and I stopped into one of them pawnbrokin'
shops to buy a shot-gun, if I could git one cheap.While I was in
there a big boy came in and pawned a gold watch an' two shirt
studs.""Is that so," returned Tom, with much interest."What kind of a
looking boy was it?""A tall, slim feller, with reddish hair.He had sech shifty eyes
I couldn't help but think that maybe he had stolen them things
jest to raise some spending money.""He said Jack Smith, but I don't think thet vas correct, for he
hesitated afore he gave it.""A tall, slim fellow, with reddish hair and shifty eyes," mused
Tom."He had on a rough suit of brownish-green and a derby hat with a
hole knocked in one side.""That description fits one of our students exactly.""What's up, Tom; do you feel worse?"asked Dick, as he wheeled as
closely to the seat of the wagon as possible.But I've made a big discovery--at least, I
feel pretty certain that I have?""I've discovered who stole that money and other stuff."CHAPTER X

A STRANGE MESSAGE FROM THE SEA


"Jim Caven!"repeated Dick slowly, "What makes you believe that he
is guilty?"Dickerson here says," answered Tom, and repeated
what the farmer had told him."Gracious, that does look black for Caven!""Would you recognize that boy
again if you saw him?"His eyes was wot got me--never saw
sech unsteady ones afore in my life.""Yes, those eyes put me down on Caven the minute I saw him,"
answered Tom."More than half of the boys at the Hall have put
him down as a first-class sneak, although we can't exactly tell
why.""I think it would be best if Mr.Dickerson
would drive back to the Hall with us and tell Captain Putnam of
what he knows.""And see if he can identify Caven," finished Sam."Are you
willing to do that, Mr."Well, to tell the truth, I've got some business to attend to
now," was the slow reply."I am sure Captain Putnam will pay you for your trouble," went on
Sam."You seem mighty anxious to bring this Caven to justice,"  smiled
the farmer."We are, for two reasons," said Tom."The first is, because he
isn't the nice sort to have around, and the second is, because one
of the men working at the school, a  waiter, whom we all
liked, has been suspected of this crime and had to run away to
avoid arrest."Well--"  The farmer mused for a moment."All right, I'll
go back with ye--and at once."The team was turned around as well as the narrow confines of the
hilly road permitted, and soon the Rover boys were on their way
back to Putnam Hall, a proceeding which pleased Tom in more ways
than one, since he would not have now to put up at a strange
resort to have his ankle and his wheel cared for.They bowled
along at a rapid gait, the horses having more speed in them than
their appearance indicated.They were just turning into the road
leading to Putnam Hall grounds when Dick espied several cadets
approaching, bound for the lake shore."Here come Caven, Willets, and several others!"Dickerson, do you recognize any of those boys?"The farmer gave a searching glance, which lasted until the
approaching cadets were beside the wagon.Then he pointed his
hand at Jim Caven."Thet's the boy I seed over to Auburn, a-pawning thet watch an'
them studs," he announced."He's got his sodger uniform on, but I
know him jest the same."Jim Caven looked at the farmer in astonishment.Then when he
heard Seth Dickerson's words he fell back and his face grew
deathly white."I--I don't know you," he stammered."I seed you over to Auburn, in a pawnshop," repeated Dickerson."I was never over to Auburn
in my life.Why should I go there to a pawnshop?""I guess you know well enough, Caven," said Tom."You bad better
come back to the Hall with us and have a talk with Captain
Putnam."This is--is a--a plot against me,"
stammered the slim youth.cried Dick, and caught Caven by the arm.But
with a jerk the seared boy freed himself and ran down the road at
the top of his speed.Sam and Dick pursued him on their bicycles, while some of the
others came after on foot.Seeing this, Jim Caven took to the
woods just as Dan Baxter had done, and the boys found it
impossible to track him any further."I wonder if he'll come back tonight?"said Dick, as the party
returned to where they had left Seth Dickerson and Tom."I don't think he will," answered Sam."I declare, he must be
almost as bad as the Baxters!"The farm wagon soon reached the Hall, and Dick ushered Seth
Dickerson into Captain Putnam's office.The captain looked
surprised at the unexpected visitor, but listened with deep
concern to all the farmer and the Rover boys had to say."This certainly looks black for Caven," he said at last."I did
not think I had such a bad boy here.And you say he got away from
you?""It is a question if he will come back--providing he is really
guilty.I will have his trunk and bag searched without delay.But if he is guilty how did that ruby stud and the watch come into
Alexander Pop's possession?""He was down on Aleck," replied Tom, who had hobbled in after the
others."And, besides, he thought if Aleck was arrested the
search for the criminal would go no further."It is a sad state of affairs at
the best."The party ascended to the dormitory which Jim Caven occupied with
several smaller boy.His trunk was found locked, but Captain Putnam
took upon himself the responsibility of hunting up a key to fit the
box.Once open the trunk was found to contain, among other things,
a bit of heavy cloth tied with a piece of strong cord.cried the captain, as he undid the
package and brought to light several of the missing watches and
also some of the jewelry."I guess it is a clear case against
Caven, and Pop is innocent.""I wish we could tell Pop of it," put in Dick."I will do what I can for the <DW64>, Rover.I am very sorry
indeed, now, that I suspected him," said Captain Putnam, with a
slow shake of his head.At the bottom of the trunk was a pocketbook containing nearly all
of the money which had been stolen.A footing-up revealed the
fact that two watches and three gold shirt studs were still
missing."And those were pawned in Auburn," said Sam."Just wait and see
if I am not right."A party was organized to hunt for Caven, and the captain himself
went to Auburn that very evening.The hunt for the missing boy
proved unsuccessful, and it may be added here that he never turned
up at Putnam Hall again nor at his home in Middletown, having run
away to the West.When Captain Putnam came back he announced that he had recovered
all but one watch.The various goods and the money were distributed
among their rightful owners, and it must be confessed that a big
sigh of relief went up from the cadets who had suffered.The
single missing timepiece was made good to the boy who had lost it,
by the captain buying a similar watch for the youth.After this several weeks passed without anything of special
interest occurring outside of a stirring baseball match with a
club from Ithaca, which Putnam Hall won by a score of six to
three.In this game Dick made a much-needed home run, thus
covering himself with glory."And they hang together like links of a chain," added Fred."The
friend of one is the friend of all, and the same can be said of an
enemy."One morning a telegraph messenger from Cedarville was seen
approaching the Hall, just as the boys were forming for the
roll-call."Here's a telegram for somebody," said Sam."A message for Richard Rover," announced George Strong, after
receiving it, and handed over the yellow envelope.Wondering what the message could contain and who had sent it, Dick
tore open the envelope and read the brief communication.As his
eyes met the words his head seemed to swim around, so bewildered
was he by what was written there.He
says--but read it for yourselves," and the elder Rover handed
over the message, which ran as follows:

"Have just received a strange message from the sea, supposed to be
written by your father."Oh, I pray Heaven the news
is true!""A strange message from the sea," repeated Dick."Perhaps it's a message that was picked up by some steamer,"
suggested Sam."Anyway, uncle wants us to come home at once.""But of course he wanted all of us to come," put in Tom."Anyway,
four horses couldn't hold me back!""If we hurry up
we can catch the noon boat at Cedarville for Ithaca.""Yes, and the evening train for Oak Run," finished Tom.To tell the truth, that message had fired him
as he had never been fired before.He burst into the captain's
office pell-mell, with Tom and Sam on his heels, to explain the
situation.Ten minutes later--and even this time seemed an age
to the brothers--they were hurrying into their ordinary clothing
and packing, their satchels, while Peleg Snuggers was hitching up
to take them to the landing at Cedarville."Good-by to you, and good luck!"shouted Frank, as they clambered
into the wagon, and many other cadets set up a shout.The Rover boys had turned their backs on dear
old Putnam Hall for a long while to come.CHAPTER XI

THE ROVERS REACH A CONCLUSION


For the three Rover boys the Golden Star could not make the trip
from Cedarville to Ithaca fast enough.They fretted over every
delay, and continually wondered if there was any likelihood of
their missing the train which was to take them to Oak Run, the
nearest railroad station to Valley Brook farm, their uncle's home.But the train was not missed; instead, they had to wait half an
hour for it.During this time they procured dinner, although Dick
felt so strange he could scarcely eat a mouthful."Uncle Randolph doesn't say much," he murmured to Tom."We'll know everything before we go to bed, Dick," answered his
brother."I don't believe Uncle Randolph would telegraph unless
the news was good."They indulged in all sorts of speculation, as the train sped on
its way to Oak Run.When the latter place was reached it was
dark, and they found Jack Ness, the hired man, waiting for them
with the carriage."There, I  knowed it," grinned Jack.Rover calculated that
only Dick would come, but I said we'd have 'em all.""And what is this news of my father?""It's a message as was picked up off the coast of Africky,"
replied Ness.Rover didn't explain very clearly to me.He's
a good deal excited, and so is the missus.""Can it be that father is on his
way home?"Leas'wise, your uncle didn't say
so," concluded the hired man.Never had the horses made better time than they did now, and yet
the boys urged Ness continually to drive faster.Swift River was
soon crossed--that stream where Sam had once had such a stirring
adventure--and they bowled along past the Fox and other farms."There is Uncle Randolph out on the porch to greet us!""I do believe they look
happy, don't you, Tom?""They certainly don't look sad," was the noncommittal answer; and
then the carriage swept up to the horse-block and the three boys
alighted."Well,
perhaps it is just as well so.""We simply couldn't stay behind, uncle,"  said Sam."And we are
dying to know what it all means.""But you must have supper first," put in Aunt Martha, as she gave
one and another a motherly kiss."I know riding on the cars
usually makes Tom tremendously hungry.""Well eat after we have had the news," said Tom."We're dying to
know all, as Sam says.""The news is rather perplexing, to tell the truth," said Randolph
Rover, as he led the way into the library of the spacious home."I hardly know what to make of it.""It came by mail--a bulky letter all the way from Cape Town,
Africa.""No, from a Captain Townsend, who, it seems, commands the clipper
ship Rosabel.came in a shout from all three of the Rover
boys."You had better read the captain's communication first," answered
Randolph Rover."Then you will be more apt to understand the
other.Or shall I read it for the benefit of all?""Yes, yes, you read it, Uncle Randolph," was the answer."The letter is dated at Cape Town, and was written a little over a
month ago.It is addressed to 'Randolph Rover, or to Richard,
Thomas, or Samuel Rover, New York City,' and is further marked
'Highly Important-Do Not Lose or Destroy.'""Do hurry and tell
us, Uncle Randolph."And then his uncle read as follows:

"TO THE ROVER FAMILY, New York:

"I am a stranger to you, but I deem it my duty to write to you on
account of something which occurred on the 12th day of April last,
while my clipper ship Rosabel, bound from Boston, U. S. A., to
Cape Town, Africa, was sailing along the coast of Congo but a few
miles due west from the mouth of the Congo River."Our ship had been sent in by a heavy gale but the wind had gone
down, and we were doing more drifting than sailing to the
southward when the lookout espied a man on a small raft which was
drifting toward us."On coming closer, we discovered that the man was white and that
he looked half starved.We put out a boat and rescued the poor
creature  but he had suffered so much from spear wounds and
starvation that, on being taken on board of our ship, he
immediately relapsed into insensibility, and out of this we failed
to arouse him.He died at sundown, and we failed, even to learn
him name or home address."On searching the dead man's pockets we came across the enclosed
letter, addressed to you, and much soiled from water.As you will
see, it is dated more than a year back and was evidently in the
possession of the man who died for some time.Probably he started
out to deliver it, or to reach some point from which it could be
mailed."I trust that the message becomes the means of rescuing the
Anderson Rover mentioned in the letter, and I will be pleased to
learn if this letter of mine is received.The Rosabel sails from
Cape Town to Brazil as soon as her cargo can be discharged and
another taken on."Very truly yours,

"JOHN V. TOWNSEND, Captain."As Randolph Rover ceased reading there was a brief silence, broken
by Tom."So the man who died held a letter.And what is in that, Uncle
Randolph?""I will read it to you, boys, although that is a difficult matter,
for the writing is uneven and much blurred.On one part of the
sheet there is a blot of blood--the blood, I presume--of the
poor fellow who was trying to deliver the communication."Unfolding the stained document, Randolph Rover bent closer to the
table lamp that he might read the more easily.As for the boys,
they fairly held their breaths, that no spoken word might escape
them."The letter is addressed to me," said the uncle."But the
envelope is, as you can see, very much torn.I will read," and he
did so."NIWILI CAMP, on the Congo,

"July the 18th, 189--."DEAR BROTHER RANDOLPH:

"If, by the goodness of God, this reaches you, I trust that you
will set out without delay to my assistance."I write under great difficulties, as a prisoner, of the Bumwo
tribe of natives, ruled by King Susko."I have discovered the secret of a gold mine here, and the king
will not let me go, fearing that I will tell the outside world of
my discovery and bring the English or French here to slay him and
his followers."I entrust this to the care of an English sailor who is going to
try to make his escape.I cannot go myself, having had my leg
broken by a blow from one of my jailers."I am sick and weak in body, and it may be that I will soon die.Yet I beg of you to do what you can for me.If I die, I trust you
to be a father to my dear boys, Dick, Tom, and Sam, and ask Martha
for me to be a mother to them."The king expects soon to remove to another camp at a place called
Rhunda Konoka (the Water Well).Perhaps he will take me along, or
else he may slay me."All those who were with me are dead excepting several natives who
have joined the Burnwo tribe."Good-by, and do what you can until you are certain that I am
dead."Your loving brother,

"ANDERSON ROVER"

When Randolph Rover ceased reading he saw that there were tears in
the eyes of all of the boys, and that his wife was also crying.His own voice had had to be cleared continually.To all the
letter was like a message from the grave."That is all, my boy--and the letter was written about a year
ago!""But we'll go in search of him!""I thought I would go," answered Randolph Rover, "and I thought,
possibly, that I might take Dick with me.""I could never bear to
be left behind.""And you must take me," interrupted Sam."We always go together,
you know."At this talk Randolph Rover was somewhat taken aback."Why, what would three boys do in the heart of Africa?""I shan't stay behind--you can't
make me!""We have been through lots of adventures, uncle, you know that,"
came from Sam."But the danger, boys--" began the uncle."What danger wouldn't we face for father's sake!""I'd
go through fire and water for him.""You had better let us all go," said Dick."If you don't let Tom and Sam go, why, the chances are they'll--"

"Run away and go anyway," finished Sam."Oh, Uncle Randolph, say we can go; please do!""All-right, boys; as you are bound to have it so, you shall all
go.But don't blame me if the perils are greater than you
anticipate, and if the undertaking costs one or more of you your
lives."OFF FOR AFRICA


It was long after midnight before the conversation in relation to
the proposed trip to Africa came to an end.Rover insisted
that the boys should eat something, and they sat around the table
discussing the viands and the two letters at the same time."Have you any idea where this Niwili Camp is?""It is on the Congo, but how far froth the mouth of that stream is
a question, lad.Probably we can learn all about it when we reach
Boma, the capital of the Congo Free State.""The Congo is a pretty big stream, isn't it?"At its mouth it is about ten miles wide, and
it is from twelve to fourteen hundred miles long.Stanley traced
its course after an expedition in which he fought over thirty
battles with the natives."The natives that live close to the
ocean are peaceable enough, so I have been told.""And how are we going to get there?""I don't suppose
there are any regular steamers running to the Congo."I have written to a shipping firm in New York
for information, and they will probably send word by morning," was
the answer.It can well be imagined that the boys slept but little that night.In the morning they telegraphed to Putnam Hall for their trunks,
and also let Captain Putnam and their chums know how matters
stood.Then began preparations for such a tour as none of them
had ever before anticipated.Word came from New York in the early afternoon mail, and the
information sent was highly satisfactory to Randolph Rover.The
French steamer Republique was in port, loading for Boma and other
African ports, and would set sail on the coming Saturday.The
firm had taken upon itself the responsibility to speak of passage
for Mr."Uncle Randolph, you had better telegraph to
them at once for passage for the four of us."Rover, and the telegram was sent within
the hour.As but little in the way of outfits
could be procured in Oak Run or the adjoining villages, it was
decided that they should go down to New York on Thursday afternoon
and spend all of Friday in purchasing in the metropolis whatever
was needed.The only person who was really sober was Mrs.Rover, for she hated
to see her husband start on such a journey, which was bound to, be
full of grave perils."I am afraid you will never come back," she said, with tears in
her eyes."And if you and Anderson are both dead to me, what will
I do?""I feel certain that
a kind Providence will watch over us and bring us all back in
safety."At last the party was ready to set off.A fond good-by was said,
and away they rattled in the carryall for the railroad station at
Oak Run.shouted Tom, as he waved his cap to his aunt,
who stood beside the gateway."And when we come back may we bring father with us," added Dick,
and Sam muttered an amen.The journey down to New York was without incident, and as the
Rovers had lived in the metropolis for years they felt thoroughly
at home and knew exactly where to go for their outfit and suitable
clothing for use in such a warm country was procured, and in
addition each was armed with a revolver.Rover also purchased
a shot-gun and a rifle, and likewise a number of cheap gold and
silver trinkets."The natives are becoming civilized," he explained."But, for all
that, I am certain a small gift now and then will go a long way
toward making friends."The found that the Republique was a stanch-built steamer of eight
thousand tons burden.Her captain, Jules Cambion, spoke English
quite fluently and soon made them feel at home.He was much
interested in the story Randolph Rover had to tell concerning his
missing brother."'Tis a strange happening, truly," he remarked."I sincerely
trust that your search for him proves successful and that he
returns to the arms of his family unharmed.I have visited it twice, and I know.""I am glad to learn that you have been up the Congo," replied
Randolph Rover."Perhaps during your leisure hours on the trip
you will not mind giving me such information as conics to your
mind.""I will tell you all I know willingly," answered Captain Cambion.Exactly at noon on Saturday the Republique was ready to sail, and
with a shout from those on the wharf who had come to see the few
passengers off, she sheered away and started down the bay, past
Bedloe Island and the Statue of Liberty.Before night the shore
line had faded from view, and they were standing out boldly into
the Atlantic Ocean."Off for Africa at last," murmured Sam, who had been standing at
the rail watching the last speck of land as it disappeared."What
a big trip this is going to be!""Never mind how big it is, Sam," came from Tom,  "if only it is
successful."The first few days on board were spent in settling themselves.The party had two connecting staterooms, and Mr.Rover and Sam
occupied one, while Dick and Tom had settled themselves in the
other.The passengers were mostly French people, who were going to try
their fortunes in French Congo.There was, however, one
Englishman, a man named Mortimer Blaze, who was bound out simply
for adventure."I'm tired of England, and tired of America too," he explained."I've hunted through the Rocky Mountains and up in Canada, as well
as at home, and now I'm going to try for a lion or a tiger in
Africa.""Perhaps the lion or tiger will try for you," smiled Tom."It will be a pitched battle, that's all," drawled Mortimer Blaze.He was rather a sleepy looking man, but quick to act when the
occasion demanded.The weather was all that could be wished, and during the first
week out the Republique made good progress.On a steamer there
was but little for the boys to do, and they spent all of their
spare time in reading the books on Africa which Captain Cambion
had in his library, and which were printed in English.Often they
persuaded the genial captain to tell them of his adventures in
that far-away country."You have many strange sights before you," he said to them one
day."The strange vegetation, the immense trees, the wonderful
waterfalls, some larger than your own Niagara, and then the odd
people.Some of the natives are little better than dwarfs, while
others are six feet and more in height and as straight as arrows."Did you ever hear of this King Susko?""Yes; I have heard of him several times.He is known as the
Wanderer, because he and his tribe wander from place to place,
making war on the other tribes."The captain knew nothing of Niwili Camp and expressed the opinion
that it had been, like many other camps, only a temporary affair.He said that the best the party could do was to strike straight up
the Congo, along the south shore, and question the different
natives met concerning King Susko's present whereabouts.On the beginning of the second week a storm was encountered which
lasted for three days.At first the wind blew at a lively rate,
and this was followed by thunder and lightning and a regular
deluge of rain, which made all of the boys stay below.The
steamer pitched from side to side and more than one wave broke
over her decks."This is the worse storm I ever saw," remarked Dick, as he held
fast to a chair in the cabin."They won't be able to set any
table for dinner today."came from Sam, with a groan."Who wants any dinner, when a fellow feels as if he was going to
be turned inside out!"So far none of the boys had suffered from
seasickness, but now poor Sam was catching it, and the youngest
Rover felt thoroughly miserable."Never mind, the storm won't last forever," said Dick
sympathetically."Perhaps you had better lie down, Sam.""How can I, with the ship tossing like a cork?I've got to hold
on, same as the rest, and be glad, I suppose, that I am alive,"
and poor Sam looked utterly miserable.It was very close in the cabin, but neither door nor port-hole
could be opened for fear of the water coming in.Dinner was a
farce, to use Tom's way of expressing it, for everything was cold
and had to be eaten out of hand or from a tin cup.Yet what was
served tasted very good to those who were hungry."I believe we'll go to the bottom before we are done," began Sam,
when a loud shout from the deck reached the ears of all of the
Rovers and made Tom and Dick leap to their feet.Above the wind they could hear a yell from a distance, and then
came more cries from the deck, followed by a bump on the side of
the steamer."But I guess it wasn't hard enough to do much damage.""That remains to be seen," answered Dick."Storm or no storm, I'm
gong on deck to learn what it means," and he hurried up the
companionway.CHAPTER XIII

A RESCUE IN MID-OCEAN


Dick found that he could remain on the deck only with the greatest
of difficulty.Several life lines had been stretched around and
he clung to one of these."Struck a small boat," was the answer."It had a <DW52> man in
it.But the captain thinks he may get over
it, with care," and the sailor hurried away.Dick now saw several men approaching, carrying the form of the
rescued one between them.He looked at the unconscious man and
gave a cry of amazement."I know him very well," answered Dick."He used to work at the
military academy where my brothers and I were cadets."And the
boy told Captain Cambion the particulars of Alexander Pop's
disappearance from Putnam Hall."I am glad that I will be able to
tell him that his innocence is established," he concluded."All providing we are able to bring him around to himself, Master
Rover," returned the captain gravely."You think, then, that he is in bad shape?"We will take him below and do all
we can for him."It was no easy matter to transfer Pop to one of the lower
staterooms, but once placed on a soft berth the Rovers did all
they could for him."It is like a romance," said Sam, while Randolph Rover was
administering some medicine to the unconscious man."He's been suffering from starvation," put in Dick."I suppose he
gave that yell we heard with his last breath."All of the party watched over the <DW52> man with tender care,
and feeling that he could be in no better hands the captain left
him entirely in his friends' charge."When he comes to his senses
you can let me know," he said.Dick was watching by Pop's side, and Tom was at the foot of the
berth, when the <DW52> man opened his eyes.As they rested on
first one Rover and then the other he stared in utter astonishment."Am I dreamin', or am I
back to Putnam Hall again?""You are safe on board an ocean
steamer.""An' yo'--whar yo' dun come from?""We are passengers on the steamer," said Tom."You were picked up
several hours ago.""Yes, but--but I can't undersand dis nohow!"persisted the
<DW52> man, and tried to sit up, only to fall back exhausted."Don't try to understand it, Aleck, until you are stronger," said
Dick."Anyt'ing, sah, anyt'ing!Why, I aint had, no reg'lar meal in
most a week!""Glory to Heaben dat I am
sabed!"And then he said no more for quite a long, while.The soup was already at hand, and it was Dick who fed it slowly
and carefully, seeing to it that Pop should have no more than his
enfeebled stomach could take care of, for overfeeding, so Mr.Rover had said, might kill the man.The next day Pop was able to sit up, although still too weak to
stand on his legs.He was continually praising Heaven for his
safety."I dun Vink I was a goner more dan once," he said."I was on de
ocean all alone about a week, I reckon, although I lost time ob
days after I'd been out two or Vree nights."Perhaps you were, Aleck," said Sam."But tell us how you got in
that position.""Dat am de queerest part ob it, Master Rober--de queerest part
of it.I got into de small boat fo' a sleep, and de fust Ving I
knowed I was miles an' miles away from eberyt'ing; yes, sah-miles
an' miles away on de boundless ocean, an' not so much as a fishin'
smack sail in sight.Golly, but wasn't I scared--I reckon I dun
most turn white!"And Aleck rolled his eyes around impressively."You were in a small boat attached to some steamer?"Da had been usin' de small boat fo' surnt'ing, and
left her overboard.""I don't tink I was--but I aint shuah nohow.""De Harrison, from Brooklyn, bound to Cuba.""Did you ship on her after you left Putnam Hall in such a hurry?"I did, cos I didn't want de police to coted me.But, say, as
true as I stand heah--mean sit heah--I aint guilty of stealin'
dem watches an' t'ings, no I aint!""Captain Putnam made a
great mistake when he dun suspect me.""We thought you innocent all
along, Aleck.""T'ank yo' fo' dat, Master Rober--I'se glad to see dat I'se got
one friend--"

"Three friends, Aleck--we all stood up for you," interrupted
Tom."T'ank yo', t'ank yo'!""And we discovered who the real thief was," added Sam."Wot, yo' dun found, dat out!""An' who was de
black-hearted rascal?""Dat cadet wot tried to be funny wid me an' I had to show him his
place?Hol' on--I dun see him comin' from de attic one day.""When he must have put those stolen articles in your trunk," said
Tom."Yes, he was guilty, Captain Putnam was going to have him
arrested, but he got away."Nothing would do for Alexander Pop after this but that the boys
give him the full particulars of the affair, to which he listened
with the closest attention."Ise mighty glad I am cleared," he said."But I'd give a good
deal to face de cap'n--jest to see wot he would say, eh?""He said he was sorry he had suspected you," said Dick."What a big fool dis darkey was to run away!""I wasn't cut out fo' no sailer man.Ise been sick
most ebery day since I left shoah.By de way, whar is dis ship
bound?"Shuah yo' is foolin', Massah Dick?"We and our uncle are bound for the Congo River."Dat's whar my great gran' fadder dun come from--so I
heard my mammy tell, years ago.I don't want to go dar, not me!""I don't see how you are going to help yourself, Aleck.The first
stop this steamer will make will be at Boma on the Congo River.""'Wot am I to do when I gits dar?Perhaps the captain will let you remain
on the Republique."I don't t'ink I could stand dat.An'
what am yo' going to do in Africa?""We are going on a hunt for my father, who has been missing for
years."Again Aleck had to be told the particulars and again he was
tremendously interested.When the boys had finished he sat in
silence for several minutes."I've got it-jest de t'ing!"Foah gen'men like yo' don't want to
go to Africa widout a valet nohow.Let me be de workin' man fe de
crowd.I'll take de job, cheap,--an' glad ob de chance.""Hullo, that's an idea!""Will yo' do it, Massah Dick?""We'll have to speak to my uncle about it first.""Well, yo' put in a good word fo' me.Yo know I always stood by
yo' in de school," pleaded the <DW52> man."I don't want to be
driftin' around jess nowhar, wid nuffin to do, an' no money comin'
in--not but what I'll work cheap, as I dun said I would," he
added hastily.A little later Randolph Rover joined the group and Aleck's
proposition was laid before him.Strange to say he accepted the
<DW52> man's offer immediately, greatly to the wonder of the
boys, and from that minute on Pop be came a member of the
searching party."I will tell you why I did it," explained Randolph Rover to the
boys in private."When we get into the jungle we will need a man
we can trust and one who is used to American ways.Moreover, if
there is any spying to be done among the natives the chances are
that a black man can do it better than a white man.""Uncle Randolph, you've got a long head," remarked Tom."No doubt
Aleck will prove just the fellow desired."And Tom was right, as
later events proved.CHAPTER XIV

A STRANGE MEETING IN BOMA


The storm delayed the passage of the Republique nearly a week, in
a manner that was totally unexpected by the captain.The fierce
waves, running mountain high, wrenched the screw and it was found
next to impossible to repair the accident.Consequently the
steamer had to proceed under a decreased rate of speed.This was tantalizing to the boys, and also to Randolph Rover, for
everyone wished to get ashore, to start up the Congo as early as
possible.But all the chafing in the world could not help
matters, and they were forced to take things as they came.A place was found among the sailors for Aleck, and soon he began
to feel like himself once more.But the sea did not suit the
<DW52> man, and he was as anxious as his masters to reach shore
once more."It's a pity da can't build a mighty bridge over de ocean, an' run
kyars," he said."Perhaps they'll have a bridge some day resting on boats, Aleck,"
answered Tom."But I don't expect to live to see it.""Yo' don't know about dat, chile.Did
yo'gran'fadder expect to ride at de rate ob sixty miles an hour?Did he expect to send a telegram to San Francisco in a couple ob
minutes?Did he eber dream ob talkin' to sumboddy in Chicago froo
a telephone?Did he knew anyt'ing about electric lights, or
movin' pictures, or carriages wot aint got no bosses, but run wid
gasoline or sumfing like dat?I tell yo, Massah Tom, we don't
know wot we is comin' to!""You are quite right, Alexander," said Mr.Rover, who had
overheard the talk.Some
day I expect to grow com and wheat, yes, potatoes and other
vegetables, by electricity," and then Randolph Rover branched off
into a long discourse on scientific farming that almost took away
poor Aleck's breath."He's a most wonderful man, yo' uncle!"whispered the <DW52> man
to Sam afterward."Fust t'ing yo' know he'll be growin' corn in
de com crib already shucked!"On and on over the mighty Atlantic bounded the steamer.One day
was very much like another, excepting that on Sundays there was a
religious service, which nearly everybody attended.The boys had
become quite attached to Mortimer Blaze and listened eagerly to
the many hunting tales he had to tell."I wish you were going with us," said Tom to him."I like your
style, as you Englishman put it.""Thanks, Rover, and I must say I cotton to you, as the Americans
put it," laughed the hunter."Well, perhaps we'll meet in the
interior, who knows?"I am hoping to meet some friends at Boma.The steamer bad now struck the equator, and as it was midsummer
the weather was extremely warm, and the smell of the oozing tar,
pouring from every joint, was sickening."Dis am jest right," he said."I could sleep eall de time,
'ceptin' when de meal gong rings.""When you land,
Alexander, you ought to feel perfectly at home.""Perhaps, sah; but I dun reckon de United States am good enough
for any man, sah, white or.""It's the greatest country on the
globe."It was a clear day a week later when the lookout announced land
dead ahead.It proved to be a point fifteen miles above the mouth
of the Congo, and at once the course was altered to the southward,
and they made the immense mouth of the river before nightfall.Far away dashed the waves against an
immense golden strand, backed up by gigantic forests of tropical
growth and distant mountains veiled in a bluish mist: The river
was so broad that they were scarcely aware that they were entering
its mouth until the captain told them.When night came the lights of Boma could be distinctly seen,
twinkling silently over the bay of the town.They dropped anchor
among a score of other vessels; and the long ocean trip became a
thing of the past."I'm all ready to go ashore," said Tom."My, but won't it feel good to put foot on land again!""The ocean is all well enough, but
a fellow doesn't want too much of it.""And yet I heard one of the French sailors say that he hated the
land," put in Sam."He hadn't set foot on shore for three years.When they reach port he always remains on deck duty until they
leave again."Mortimer Blaze went ashore at once, after bidding all of the party
a hearty good-by."And, anyway,
good luck to you!""Hope you bag all of the lions
and tigers you wish," and so they parted, not to meet again for
many a day.It was decided that the Rovers should not leave the ship until
morning.It can well be imagined that none of the boys slept
soundly that night.All wondered what was before them, and if
they should succeed or fail in their hunt."Dis aint much ob a town," remarked Aleck, as they landed, a
little before noon, in a hot, gentle shower of rain."There is only one New York, as there is but one London," answered
Randolph Rover."Our architecture would never do for such a hot
climate."Along the river front was a long line of squatty warehouses,
backed up by narrow and far from clean streets, where the places
of business were huddled together, and where a good share of the
trading was done on the sidewalk.The population was a very much
mixed one, but of the Europeans the English and French
predominated.The natives were short, fat, and exceedingly greasy
appearing.Hardly a one of them could speak English."I don't see any Americans," remarked Dick."I suppose--"

"There is an American store!"burst out Sam, pointing across the
way.He had discovered a general trading store, the dilapidated
sign of which read:

          SIMON HOOK,

       Dealer in Everything."I'd like to go in
and see Simon Hook.Rover was willing, and they entered the low and dingy-looking
establishment, which was filled with boxes, barrels, and bags of
goods.They found the proprietor sitting in an easy chair, his feet on a
desk, and a pipe in his mouth."That's me," was the answer; but Mr.Hook did not offer to rise,
nor indeed to even shift his position."We saw your sign and as we are Americans we thought we would drop
in," went on Mr."That's right; glad to see you," came from the man in the chair;
but still he did not offer to shift his position."It's a fool's place to come to, sonny.When these goods are sold
I'm going to quit."Simon Hook paused long enough to take an
extra whiff from his pipe."We are on a hunt for a missing man," answered Randolph Rover.His name is Anderson Rover, and he is my
brother."He was a gold hunter from Californy, or somethin' like that.""Went up the Congo four or five years ago--maybe longer?"He had lots of money, and took several guides
and a number of other, natives along.""Have you seen or heard of him since?""Because them as goes up the Congo never, comes back.It's a
fool's trip among those wild people of the interior.Stanley went
up, but look at the big party he took with him and the many fights
he had to get back alive."At this announcement the hearts of the Rover boys fell.I reckon he's either lost in the jungle or
among the mountains, or else the natives have taken care of him.""Did he say anything about the trail he was going to take?""He was going to take the Rumbobo trail, most all of 'em do.""Say, can I sell you any of these
old things of mine cheap?""Glad to see you," and as they left the shopkeeper waved them a
pleasant adieu with his hand."I guess he has grown tired of trying to sell goods," observed
Tom."Perhaps he knows that if folks want the things he has to sell
they are bound to come to him," said Dick."His store seems to
be the only one of its sort around."The hotel for which they were bound was several squares away,
located in something of a park, with pretty flowers and a
fountain.It was a two-story affair, with spacious verandas and
large rooms, and frequented mostly by English and French people.They had just entered the office; and Randolph Rover was writing
his name in the register, when Dick caught sight of somebody in
the reading room that nearly took away his breath.It is Dan Baxter--Dan
Baxter, just as sure as you are born!"CHAPTER XV

CAPTAIN VILLAIRE'S LITTLE PLOT


Dick was right: the boy in the reading-room' was indeed Dan Baxter,
but so changed in appearance that for the minute neither Tom nor
Sam recognized him.In the past Baxter had always been used to fine clothing, which he
had taken care should be in good repair.Now his clothing was
dilapidated and his shoes looked as if they were about ready to
fall apart.More than this, his face was hollow and careworn, and one eye
looked as if it had suffered severe blow of some sort.Altogether
he was most wretched-looking specimen of humanity, and it was a
wonder that he was allowed at the hotel.But the truth of the
matter was that he had told the proprietor a long tale of
sufferings in the interior and of a delayed remittance from home,
and the hotel keeper was keeping him solely on this account."He looks like a regular
tramp!""He's been in hard luck, that's certain," came from Sam."I
wonder how he drifted out here?"While Sam was speaking Dan Baxter raised his eyes from the
newspaper and glanced around.As his gaze fell upon the three
Rover boys he started and the paper fell to the floor, then he got
up and strode toward them."From Putnam Hall, Baxter," answered Dick quietly.Ordinarily Dan Baxter would have retorted that that was none of
Dick's business, but now he was in thoroughly low spirits, and he
answered meekly:

"I've been playing in hard luck.I went down to New York and one
night when I was in a sailors' boarding house I drank more than
was good for me, and when I woke up in the morning I found myself
on a vessel bound for Africa.""You were shanghaied as a sailor?""That's it, and while I was on board the Costelk the captain and
mate treated me worse than a dog.The captain did
that, and when I struck back he put me in irons and fed me nothing
but stale biscuits and water.""No; she was bound for Cape Town, but stopped here for supplies,
and I jumped overboard at night and swam ashore, and here I am,
and sorry for it," and Dan Baxter drew a long breath.The Rovers were astonished at his meek manner.Was this really
the domineering Baxter, who had always insisted on having his own
way, and who had done so many wrong deeds in the past?"You've had a hard time of it, I suppose?said Dick, hardly
knowing how to go on."Hard, Dick, aint no word," came from the former bully of Putnam
Hall."I've run up against the worst luck that anybody could ever
imagine.But I reckon you don't care about that?""Do you think we ought to care, Baxter?""Well, it aint fair to take advantage of a chap when he's down on
his luck," grumbled the former bully."I guess I've learnt my
lesson all right enough.""Do you mean to say you are going to turn over a new leaf?""Yes, if I ever get the chance."Randolph Rover now joined the group, and Dick explained the
situation.Rover questioned Baxter closely and found that he
was without a cent in his pocket and that the hotel keeper had
threatened to put him out if he was not able to pay up inside of
the next twenty-four hours."See here, Baxter, you never were my friend, and you never
deserved any good from me, but I don't like to see a dog suffer,"
said Dick."I'll give you thirty shillings, and that will help
you along a little," and he drew out his purse."And I'll give you the same," came from Tom."But don't forget that what Dick says
is true, nevertheless."Ninety English shillings--about twenty-two dollars of our money--was
more cash than Dan Baxter had seen in some time, his other
money having been spent before he had taken his unexpected ocean
trip, and his eyes brightened up wonderfully."I'll be much obliged to you for the--the loan," he stammered."I'll pay you back some time, remember.""My advice to you is, to take the first ship you can for home.""And what brought you out here--going on a hunt for your
father?""You'll have a big job finding him.I understand the natives of
the Congo are going on the warpath before long.They have had
some difficulty with the settlers.""I guess we'll manage to take care of ourselves," answered Tom,
and then he and his brothers followed their uncle up to the rooms
which had been engaged for them during their stay in the town."He's, down in the mouth, and no mistake," was Tom's comment, when
the boys were left to themselves."I never saw him so humble
before.""Perhaps knocking around has taught him a lesson," said Dick."I
hope he really does turn over a new leaf."Randolph Rover gathered all the
information he could concerning the trail along the Congo, and
also tried to locate Niwili Camp.He likewise purchased several
additions to his outfits from Simon Hook, and engaged the services
of several natives, the leader of whom was a brawny black named
Cujo, a fellow who declared that he knew every foot of the
territory to be covered and who said he was certain that he could
locate King Susko sooner or later."Him bad man," he said soberly."No et him catch you, or you
suffer big lot!"Cujo took to Aleck from the start, and the pair
soon became warm friends.The African inspected their outfits
with interest and offered several suggestions regarding additional
purchases.Three days were spent in Boma, and during that time the Rovers saw
a good deal of Dan Baxter, who, having nothing better to do, hung
around them continually.He remained as meek as before, but our
friends did not know that this was merely the meekness of a savage
cur while under the whip.Baxter was naturally a brute, and
lacked the backbone necessary far genuine reformation."Say, why can't you take me with you?"he asked, on the day that
the Rover expedition was to start out."I'm willing to do my
share of the work and the fighting, and I won't charge you a cent
for my service.""I don't know as my uncle wants anybody along," said Sam, to whom
Baxter addressed his remarks."Well, won't you speak to him about it, Sam?I can't find
anything to do here, and the captains to whom I've applied don't
want me on their ships," pleaded the former bully of Putnam Hall.Sam was easily touched at all times, and he knew that Baxter must
feel lonely and wretched so far from home and without friends or
capital.He at once went to his brothers and his uncle and laid
the big youth's proposition before them."We don't want him," said Dick promptly."I don't believe he would be of any use to us.""I would rather give him some more money just for him to stay
behind," added Tom."Well, I don't like Baxter any more than the others do.But it
seems awfully hard on him.I don't believe he knows how to turn.""We might give him enough money to get back to the United States
with.""I'd rather have you do that, Uncle Randolph," said Dick."I
don't want him with me.""I will have a talk with the misguided boy," was the conclusion
reached by Randolph Rover; but he got no chance to speak to Dan
Baxter until late in the afternoon, and then, to his astonishment,
Baxter's manner had changed entirely, he intimating that he wanted
nothing more to do with them.For in the meantime something which was bound to be of great
importance to the Rovers had occurred.In Boma were a number of
persons of mixed French and native blood who were little better
than the old-time brigands of Italy.They were led by a wicked
wretch who went by the name of Captain Villaire.Villaire had
been watching the Rovers for two days when he noticed the coldness
which seemed to exist between, our friends and Baxter.At once he
threw himself in Baxter's way and began to it pump the youth
regarding the Americans."Zay are going into the interior, you have remarked," he said in
very bad English."Yes, they are well fixed," answered the tall youth."And zay do carry zare money wid zem?""I guess not--at least, not much of it.""Yes, I hate them," muttered Dan, and his eyes shone wickedly."I'm only treating them in a friendly way now because I'm out of
money and must do something."It ees a good head you have--verra good," murmured
Captain Villaire."Do you know, I heara dem talk about you?""De one boy say you should be in ze jail; didn't you robba
somebody.""You lika do somet'ing wid me?"continued the French native,
closing one eye suggestively.He was a close reader of human
nature and had read Baxter's character as if it was an open book."We gitta dem people into trouble--maka big lot of money.""All right--I'll do anything," answered Baxter savagely."So
they said I ought to be in jail, eh?"You helpa me, I helpa you," went on the wily French native.He had his plan all ready, and, after sounding Baxter some more,
revealed what was in his mind, which was simply to follow the
Rovers into the interior and then make them prisoners.Once this
was done, they would hold the prisoners for a handsome ransom."That's a big job," answered the big youth."But I like your
plan, first-rate if you can carry it out.""I have half a dozen of ze
best of killowers-za, nevair fail me.But as you knowa dem you
will have to do ze lettair writing for us, so zat we git ze money
from zare people at home.""Trust me for that," responded Baxter quickly."You do the capturing and I'll make Mrs.Rover or
somebody else pay up handsomely, never fear."And so a compact was formed which was to give the Rovers a good
deal of trouble in the near future.CHAPTER XVI

THE START UP THE CONGO


"It was queer Dan Baxter should act so," said Sam to his uncle,
when Mr.Rover came back from his interview with the bully."I
thought he wanted to, go the worst way.""He acted as if he had struck something else," answered Randolph
Rover."He didn't even want the money I offered.Perhaps he has
received a remittance from home.""His father is still in
jail.""Perhaps he got Mumps to send it to him," said Sam."But I
forgot, Mumps is away."There was no time to discuss the situation further, for they were
to start early on the following morning, and there were yet a
dozen small matters which must be given attention.All were busy,
and it was not until after eleven that evening that they turned
in.The day for the departure from Boma dawned bright and clear, and
Cujo appeared with his assistants while they were still eating
breakfast."Werry good day for um journey," he said, with a grin."Make good
many miles if nothing go wrong.""You can't do any too well for me," answered Dick."I hope our
expedition into the interior is both short and successful."At first they had thought to go
on horseback; but this was abandoned by the advice of the native,
who declared that horses would prove more of a drag than a help in
many places."Horse canno' climb tree bridge," he explained."No climb high
rock, no go around bad hill.We go on foot an' make better time."The town was soon left behind and they struck a highway which for
several miles afforded easy traveling.On all sides were dense
groves of tropical growth, palms, mangoes, and the like, with
enormous vines festooned from one tree to the next.Underneath
were a great variety, of ferns and mosses, the homes of countless
insects and small animals.The ground was black and wherever
turned up gave forth a sickly odor of decayed vegetation."That is regular fever territory," explained Randolph Rover."Boys, do not sleep on the ground if you can possibly avoid it.I
sincerely trust that none of us take the tropical fever.""If I feel it coming on I'll take a good dose of quinine,"
declared Tom.Fortunately they had brought along a good supply of that valuable
drug.On one side
of the highway was the broad river, which glinted like molten lead
in the sunshine.They could not travel very close to its bank,
for here the ground was uncertain.Once Sam left the highway to
get a better view of the stream, and, before Cujo noticed it,
found himself up to his knees in a muck which stuck to him like so
much glue.roared the youngest Rover, and all of the party
turned, to behold him waving his hand frantically toward them.exclaimed Aleck, and started to go
to Sam's assistance, when Cujo called him back."Must be werry careful," said the native."Ground bad over
dare--lose life if urn don't have a care.And he
approached Sam by a circuitous route over the tufts of grass
which grew like so many dots amid the swamp.Soon he was close
enough to throw the youth the end of a rope he carried.The pull
that, followed nearly took Sam's arms out by the sockets; but the
boy was saved, to return to the others of the party with an
experience which was destined to be very useful to him in, the
future."It will teach me to be careful of where I am going after this,"
he declared."Why, that bog looked almost as safe as the ground
over here!""Tropical places are all full of just such treacherous swamps,"
returned Randolph Rover."It will be wise for all of us to
remember that we are now in a strange territory and that we must
have our eyes and ears wide open."At half-past eleven they came to a halt for dinner.The sun was
now almost overhead, and they were glad enough to seek the shelter
of a number of palms standing in front of a--native hostelry."We will rest here until two o'clock," said Mr."It is all
out of the question to travel in the heat of the day, as we did
yesterday, in such a climate as this.They found the hostelry presided over by a short, fat native who
scarcely spoke a word of English.But he could speak French, and
Mr.Rover spoke to him in that language, while Cujo carried on a
talk in the native tongue.The midday repast was cooked over a
fire built between several stones.The boys watched the cooking
process with interest and were surprised to find, when it came to
eating, that the food prepared tasted so good.They had antelope
steak and a generous supply of native bread, and pure cocoa, which
Tom declared as good as chocolate.After the meal they took it easy in a number of grass hammocks
stretched beneath the wide spreading palms surrounding the wayside
inn, if such it might be called.Aleck and Cujo fell to smoking
and telling each other stories, while the Rovers dozed away, lulled
to sleep by the warm, gentle breeze which was blowing."I don't wonder the natives are lazy," remarked Dick, when his
uncle aroused him."I rarely slept in the daytime at home, and
here I fell off without half trying.""The climate is very enervating, Dick.That is why this section
of the globe makes little or no progress toward civilization.Energetic men come here, with the best intention in the world of
hustling, as it is termed, but soon their ambition oozes out of
them like--well, like molasses out of a barrel lying on a hot
dock in the sun.he called out, and soon the party was on
its way again.The highway was still broad, but now it was not as even as before,
and here and there they had to leap over just such a treacherous
swamp as had caused Sam so much trouble."It's a good thing we
didn't bring the horses," said Mr."I didn't think so
before, but I do now."The jungle was filled with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes,
and colors.Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but
the majority uttered only sounds which were as painful to the
hearing as they were tiresome."The sound is enough to drive a nervous fellow crazy," declared
Tom."It's a good thing nature fixed it so that a man can't grow
up nervous here.""Perhaps those outrageous cries are meant to wake a chap up,"
suggested Dick."I've a good mind to shoot some of the little pests.""You may take a few shots later on and see what you can bring down
for supper," answered his uncle."But just now let us push on as
fast as we can.""Remember we are out here to find father, not
to hunt.""As if I would ever forget that," answered Dick, with a
reproachful glance.They were now traveling a bit of a hill which took them, temporarily,
out of sight of the Congo.Cujo declared this was a short route
and much better to travel than the other.The way was through a
forest of African teak wood, immense trees which seemed to tower
to the very skies."They are as large as the immense trees of California of which you
have all heard," remarked Randolph Rover."It is a very useful
wood, used extensively in ship building.""After all, I think a boat on the Congo would have been better to
use than shoe leather," said Sam, who was beginning to grow tired."No use a boat when come to falls," grinned Cujo.Aleck had been dragging behind, carrying a heavy load, to which
he was unaccustomed.Now he rejoined the others with the
announcement that another party was in their rear."They are on foot, too," he said."Cujo whar you dun t'ink da be
gwine?""To the next settlement, maybe," was Randolph Rover's comment,
and Cujo nodded.They waited a bit for the other party to come up, but it did not,
and, after walking back, Cujo returned with the announcement that
they were nowhere in sight."Perhaps they turned off on a side road," said Tom, and there the
matter was dropped, to be brought to their notice very forcibly
that night.Evening found them at another hostelry, presided over by a
Frenchman who had a giant negress for a wife.The pair were a
crafty looking couple, and did not at all please the Rovers."Perhaps we may as well sleep with one eye open tonight," said
Randolph Rover, upon retiring."We are in a strange country, and
it's good advice to consider every man an enemy until he proves
himself a friend."The hostelry was divided into half a dozen rooms, all on the
ground floor.The Rovers were placed in two adjoining apartments,
while the natives and Aleck were quartered in an addition of
bamboo in the rear."Keep your eyes and ears open, Aleck," whispered Dick, on
separating from the faithful <DW52> man."And if you find
anything wrong let us know at once.""Do you suspect anyt'ing, Massah Rober?"Something in the air seems to tell me that
everything is not as it should be.""Dat Frenchman don't look like no angel, sah," and Aleck shook his
head doubtfully."You're right, Aleck, and his wife is a terror, or else I miss my
guess.""Dat's right, Massah Rober; nebber saw sech sharp eyes.Yes, I'll
look out-fo' my own sake as well as fo' de sake ob Ye and de
rest," concluded Aleck.CHAPTER XVII

THE ATTACK AT THE HOSTELRY


The night was exceptionally cool for that locality; and, utterly
worn out by their tiresome journey, all of the Rovers slept more
soundly than they had anticipated.Dick had scarcely dropped off when he heard a
noise at the doorway, which was covered with a rough grass
curtain."Dat's all right," came in a whisper from Aleck."Is dat yo',
Massah Dick?""I dun discovered somet'ing, sah.""Dat udder party dun come up an' is in de woods back ob dis,
house.""No; dare is a Frenchman wot is talkin' to dah chap wot runs dis
shebang, sah.""Perhaps he wants accommodations," mused Dick."Can't say about dat, sah.But de fellers who come up hab a lot
ob ropes wid 'em."came sleepily from Tom, and presently Randolph
Rover and Sam likewise awoke.In a few words the <DW52> man explained the situation.He had
just finished when the wife of the proprietor of the resort came
up to the doorway."The gentleman is wanted outside by my husband," she said in
broken French.But he says please to step out for a moment."Rover repeated the woman's words to the boys."I tell you something is wrong," declared Dick."But what can be wrong, my lad?""If you go outside I'll go with you, Uncle Randolph.""Well, you can do that if you wish."The pair arose and speedily slipped on the few garments which they
had taken off."Do you think it is as bad as that?"But I'm going to take uncle's advice
and count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend."Rover and Dick were ready to go out, and they did so,
followed by Aleck and preceded by the native woman.As it was
dark the Rovers easily concealed their weapons in the bosoms of
their coats.They walked past the bamboo addition and to the grove of trees
Aleck had mentioned.There they found the Frenchman in
conversation with Captain Villaire."Very much," answered Villaire in French."And this is one of your nephews?""I believe you are hunting for the young man's father?""He is, then,
alive?""Yes; but a prisoner, and very sick.He heard of your being in
Boma by accident through a native of King Susko's tribe who was
sent to the town for some supplies.I heard the story and I have
been employed to lead you to him, and at once.""But--but this is marvelous," stammered Randolph Rover."I must
say I do not understand it.""It is a very queer turn of affairs, I admit.Rover
must explain to you when you meet.He wishes you to come to him
alone.As well as he was able Randolph Rover explained matters to Dick.In the meantime, however, the youth had been looking around
sharply and had noted several forms gliding back and forth in the
gloom under the trees."Uncle Randolph, I don't believe this man," he said briefly."The
story he tells is too unnatural.""I think so myself, Dick; but still--"

"Why didn't this man come straight to the house to tell us this?"Randolph Rover put the question to Captain Villaire.The
Frenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders."I had my
reason," he said briefly.Before Randolph Rover could answer there came a shout from behind
several trees.repeated Dick, when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed
at him and Randolph Rover and surrounded the pair.In a twinkle,
before either could use his pistol, he was hurled flat and made a
prisoner."Bind them, men," ordered Villaire sternly."And bind them well,
so that escape is impossible."yelled, out Dick, before those on top
of him could choke him off.And off he sped at top
speed, with three or four of Captain Villaire's party after him.Cujo also went to the house, bewildered by what was going on and
hardly knowing how to turn.Randolph Rover fought desperately and so did Dick.But the two
were no match for the six men who had attacked them, and ere they
knew it the Rovers were close prisoners, with their hands bound
behind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his
mouth."Now march, or you will be shot," came in bad English from one of
the Villaire party.And as there seemed nothing better to do they
marched, wondering why they had been attacked and where they were
to be taken.Their arms had been confiscated, so further
resistance was useless.When Dick lagged behind he received a
cruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong.A journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing
overlooking the Congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty
feet above the surface of the stream.Here, in years gone by, a
rough log hut had been built, which the African International
Association had once used as a fort during a war with the natives.The log hut was in a state of decay, but still fit for use and
almost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered
it.The men who had brought Randolph Rover and Dick hither evidently
knew all about the hut, for they proceeded to make themselves at
home without delay.Taking the Rovers into one of the apartments
of the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the
walls, one several yards from the other."Now you must wait until Captain Villaire returns," said the
leader of the party in French."He will tell you what it means," grinned the brigand, and walked
away to another part of the hut, which was built in a long,
rambling fashion, and contained a dozen or more divisions."We are in a pickle," remarked Dick dismally."This is hunting
up father with a vengeance."But I would like to know what this
means.""It probably means robbery, for one thing, Uncle Randolph."If I am not mistaken I saw some of these rascals hanging around
the hotel in Boma."They have been watching their chance
to attack us ever since we left the town."Slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned.The positions of
both Dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones, and the
youth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his
shoulders through having his arms tied behind him.At last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of
the rambling building.He had scarcely spoken when Captain Villaire appeared, followed
by--Dan Baxter!CHAPTER XVIII

A DEMAND OF IMPORTANCE


Dick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he
gazed at the former bully of Putnam Hall and the Frenchman who
stood beside him."Well, that's a good one, I must
say."He is in with these rascals who have captured us," came quickly
from Dick."This is how you repay our kindness, Baxter?"Didn't I refuse your
offer, made just before you went away?""But you didn't refuse the first money we gave you, Baxter.""We won't talk about that, Dick
Rover.Do you realize that you are absolutely in my power?"It was not you who captured us, Baxter.""Well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, Capitan Villaire?"and
the big boy turned to the French brigand, who nodded."Ve will not speak of zem udders," broke in Captain Villaire."Did Baxter put up this plot against us?"To be sure I did," answered Baxter, who loved to brag just as
much as ever."And before I let you go I'm going to make you pay up dearly for
all that I have suffered.Captain Villaire, have you had them
searched?""Yees, Baxter, but za had not mooch monish wid zem.""Then they left it behind at Binoto's place," was the quick
answer."Now if those others aren't captured--"

"Hush, ve vill not speak of zat," put in the brigand hastily."Tell zeni what I haf tole you."Dan Baxter turned once more to the
prisoners."Do you know why you were brought here?""To be robbed, I presume," answered Randolph Rover."Or that and worse," said Dick significantly,

"I reckon I have a right to all of your money, Dick Rover.""I don't see how you make that out, Baxter.""Years ago your father robbed mine out of the rights to a rich
gold mine in the United States."I claim, and so did my father,
that the mine was ours."The mine was discovered by my fattier, and if
everything had gone right he would have had the income from it."What do you
intend to do with us?""We intend to make money out of you," was the answer, given with a
rude laugh."First you will have to answer a few questions.""Zat ees it," put in Captain Villaire."How mooch morlish you
bring wid you from America?""We didn't bring much," answered Randolph Rover, who began to
smell a mouse."You leave zat in Boma, wid ze bankers, eh?""But you haf von big lettair of credit, not so?""Yes, we have a letter of credit," answered Randolph Rover."But
that won't do you any good, nor the money at the banker's
neither.""Ve see about zat, monsieur.Proceed," and Captain Villaire waved
his hand toward Dan Baxter."This is the situation in a nutshell, to come right down to
business," said the former bully of Putnam Hall coolly."You are
our prisoners, and you can't get away, no matter how hard you try.Captain Villaire and his men, as well as myself, are in this
affair to make money.The question is, what is your liberty worth
to you?""So you intend to work such a game?""Well, I shan't pay you a cent.""Don't be a fool, Dick Rover."Well, I haven't any money, and that ends it."Then you will have to foot the bill," continued Dan Baxter,
turning to Randolph Rover."If you value your liberty you will pay us what we demand.""We demand twenty thousand dollars--ten thousand for the liberty
of each."This demand nearly took away Randolph Rover's breath.You are worth a good deal more than that, Mr.And
I am demanding only what is fair.""Perhaps you'll sing a different tune in a few, days--after your
stomachs get empty," responded Dan Baxter, with a malicious gleam
in his fishy eyes."So you mean to starve us into acceding to your
demands," said Dick."Baxter, I always did put you down as a
first-class rascal.If you keep, on, you'll be more of a one than
your father."In high rage the former bully of Putnam Hall strode forward and
without warning struck the defenseless Dick a heavy blow on the
cheek."That, for your impudence," he snarled."You keep a civil tongue
in your head.If you don't--"  He finished with a shake of his
fist."You had bettair make up your mind to pay ze monish," said Captain
Villaire, after a painful pause."It will be ze easiest way out
of ze situation for you.""Don't you pay a cent, Uncle Randolph," interrupted Dick quickly.Then Baxter hit him again, such a stinging blow that he almost
lost consciousness."He is tied up, otherwise you
would never have the courage to attack him.Baxter, have you no
spirit of fairness at all in your composition?""Don't preach--I won't listen to it!""You
have got to pay that money.If you don't--well, I don't believe
you'll ever reach America alive, that's all."With these words Dan Baxter withdrew, followed by Captain
Villaire.They value their lives too much to
refuse.Just wait until they have suffered the pangs of hunger
and thirst, and you'll see how they change their tune.""You are certain za have ze monish?"It will only be a question of waiting for
the money after they send for it.""Neither will I--if we are safe here.You don't think anybody
will follow us?""Not unless za find ze way up from ze rivair.Za cannot come here
by land, because of ze swamps," answered the Frenchman."And ze
way from ze rivair shall be well guarded from now on," he added.CHAPTER XIX

WHAT HAPPENED TO TOM AND SAM


Let us return to Tom and Sam, at the time they were left alone at
Binoto's hostelry."I wish we had gone with Dick and Uncle Randolph," said Tom, as he
slipped into his coat and shoes."I don't like this thing at
all.""Oh, don't get scared before you are hurt, Tom!""These people out here may be peculiar, but--"

Sam did not finish.A loud call from the woods had reached his
ears, and in alarm he too began to dress, at the same time
reaching for his pistol and the money belt which Randolph Rover
had left behind."I--I guess something is wrong," he went on, after a pause."If
we--"

"Tom!came from Aleck, and in a
second more the <DW64>, burst on their view."Come, if yo' is
dressed!"And
Aleck almost dragged the boy along.The Rover boys could readily surmise that Aleck would not act in
this highly excited manner unless there was good cause for it.Consequently, as Sam said afterward, "They didn't stand on the
order of their going, but just flew."Pell-mell out of the
hostelry they tumbled, and ran up the highway as rapidly as their
nimble limbs would permit.They heard several men coming after them, and heard the command
"Halt!"yelled after them in both French and bad English.But
they did not halt until a sudden tumble on Tom's part made the
others pause in dismay.groaned the fun-loving Rover, and tried to
stand up."We ain't got no time ter lose!"panted Aleck, who was almost
winded."If we stay here we'll be gobbled up--in no time, dat's
shuah!""Let us try to carry Tom," said Sam, and attempted to lift his
brother up."De trees--let us dun hide in, de trees!"went on the <DW64>,
struck by a certain idea.groaned Tom, and then shut his teeth hard
to keep himself from screaming with pain.Together they carried the suffering youth away from the highway to
where there was a thick jungle of trees and tropical vines.The
vines, made convenient ladders by which to get up into the trees,
and soon Sam and Aleck were up and pulling poor Tom after them."Now we must be still," said Aleck, when they were safe for the
time being."Hear dem a-conun' dis way."The three listened and soon made out the footsteps of the
approaching party."But, oh, Aleck, what does it all mean?""It means dat yo' uncle an' Dick am prisoners--took by a lot of
rascals under a tall, Frenchman.""Yes, but I don't understand--"

"No more do I, Massah Sam, but it war best to git out, dat's as
shuah as yo' is born," added the <DW52> man solemnly.Poor Torn was having a wretched time of it with his ankle, which
hurt as badly as ever and had begun to swell.As he steadied
himself on one of the limbs of the tree Sam removed his shoe,
which gave him a little relief.From a distance came a shouting, and they made out through the
trees the gleam of a torch.But soon the sounds died out and the
light disappeared."One thing is certain, I can't walk just yet," said Tom."When I
put my foot down it's like a thousand needles darting through my
leg.""Let us go below and hunt up some water," said Sam; and after
waiting a while longer they descended into the small brush.Aleck
soon found a pool not far distant, and to this they carried Tom,
and after all had had a drink, the swollen ankle was bathed, much
to the sufferer's relief.As soon as the sun was
up Aleck announced that he was going back to the hostelry to see
how the land lay."But don't expose yourself," said Tom."I am certain now that is
a regular robbers' resort, or worse."Aleck was gone the best part of three hours.When he returned he
was accompanied by Cujo.The latter announced that all of the
other natives had fled for parts unknown."The inn is deserted," announced Aleck.Even that <DW52> wife of
the proprietor is gone."And did you find any trace of Dick and my uncle?""We found out where dat struggle took place," answered, Aleck."And Cujo reckons as how he can follow de trail if we don't wait
too long to do it.""Must go soon," put in Cujo for himself."Maybe tomorrow come big storm--den track all washed away.""You can go on, but you'll have to
leave me behind.I couldn't walk a hundred yards for a barrel of
gold.""Oh, we can't think of leaving you behind!""I'll tell you wot--Ise dun carry him, at least fe a spell,"
said Aleck, and so it was arranged.Under the new order of things Cujo insisted on making a scouting
tour first, that he might strike the trail before carrying them
off on a circuitous route, thus tiring Aleck out before the real
tracking began.The African departed, to be gone the best Part of an hour.When
he came back there was a broad grin of satisfaction on his homely
features."Cujo got a chicken," he announced, producing the fowl."And here
am some werry good roots, too.Now va dinner befo' we start out."cried Pop, and began to start up a fire
without delay, while Cujo cleaned the fowl and mashed up the
roots, which, when baked on a hot stone, tasted very much like
sweet potatoes.The meal was enjoyed by all, even Tom eating his
full share in spite of his swollen ankle, which was now gradually
resuming its normal condition.Cujo had found the trail at a distance of an eighth of a mile
above the wayside hostelry."Him don't lead to de ribber dare,"
he said."But I dun think somet'ing of him."asked Tom, from his seat on Aleck's
back."I t'ink he go to de kolobo.""De kolobo old place on ribber-place where de white soldiers shoot
from big fort-house.""But would the authorities allow, them to go
there?""No soldiers dare now--leave kolobo years ago.Well, follow the trail as best you can--and we'll see
what we will see.""And let us get along just as fast as we can," added Sam.On they went through a forest that in spots was so thick they
could scarcely pass.The jungle contained every kind of tropical
growth, including ferns, which were beautiful beyond description,
and tiny vines so wiry that they cut like a knife."But I suppose it doesn't hold a
candle to what is beyond.""Werry bad further on," answered Cujo."See, here am de trail,"
and he pointed it out.Several miles were covered, when they came to a halt in order to
rest and to give Aleck a let up in carrying Tom.The youth now
declared his foot felt much better and hobbled along for some
distance by leaning on Sam's shoulder.Presently they were startled by hearing a cry from a distance.They listened intently, then Cujo held up his hand."Me go an' see about dat," he said."Keep out ob sight, all ob
you!"And he glided into the bushes with the skill and silence of
a snake.Another wait ensued, and Tom improved the time by again bathing
his foot in a pool which was discovered not far from where Cujo
had left them.The water seemed to do much good, and the youth
declared that by the morrow he reckoned he would be able to do a
fair amount of walking if they did not progress too rapidly."I declare they could burn wood night and day for a century and
never miss a stick.""I thought I heard some monkeys chattering a while ago," answered
Sam."I suppose the interior is alive with them.""I dun see a monkey lookin' at us now, from dat tree," observed
Aleck."See dem shinin' eyes back ob de leaves?"He pointed with
his long forefinger, and both, boys gazed in the direction.He started back and the others did the same.And they were none
too soon, for an instant later the leaves were thrust apart and a
serpent's form appeared, swaying slowly to and fro, as if
contemplating a drop upon their very heads!CHAPTER XX

THE FIGHT AT THE OLD FORT


For the instant after the serpent appeared nobody spoke or moved.The waving motion of the reptile was fascinating to the last
degree, as was also that beady stare from its glittering eyes.The stare was fixed upon poor Tom, and having retreated but a few
feet, he now stood as though rooted to the spot.Slowly the form
of the snake was lowered, until only the end of its tail kept it
up on the tree branch.Then the head and neck began to swing back
and forth, in a straight line with Tom's face.The horrible fascination held the poor, boy as by a spell, and he
could do nothing but look at those eyes, which seemed to bum
themselves upon his very brain.Closer and closer, and still
closer, they came to his face, until at last the reptile prepared
to strike.It was Sam's pistol that spoke up, at just the right
instant, and those beady eyes were ruined forever, and the wounded
head twisted in every direction, while the body of the serpent,
dropping from the tree, lashed and dashed hither and thither in
its agony.Then the spell was broken, and Tom let out such a yell
of terror as had never before issued from his lips.came a second shot from Sam's pistol.But the serpent was
moving around too rapidly for a good aim to be taken, and only the
tip of the tail was struck.Then, in a mad, blind fashion, the
snake coiled itself upon Aleck's foot, and began, with
lightning-like rapidity, to encircle the <DW52> man's body.shrieked Aleck, trying to pull the snake off with his
hands.or Ise a dead man, shuah!""Catch him by the neck, Aleck!"ejaculated Tom, and brought out
his own pistol.Watching his chance, he pulled the trigger twice,
sending both bullets straight through the reptile's body.Then
Sam fired again, and the mangled head fell to the ground.But dead or alive the body still encircled Aleck, and the
contraction threatened to cave in the <DW52> man's ribs.went Tom's pistol once more, and now the snake had
evidently had enough of it, for it uncoiled slowly and fell to the
ground in a heap, where it slowly shifted from one spot to another
until life was extinct.But neither the boys nor the <DW52> man
waited to see if it was really dead.Instead, they took to their
heels and kept on running until the locality was left a
considerable distance behind."That was a close shave," said Tom, as he dropped on the ground
and began to nurse his lame ankle once more.but that snake
was enough to give one the nightmare!""Don't say a word," groaned Aleck, who had actually turned pale."I vought shuah I was a goner, I did fo' a fac'!I don't want to
meet no mo' snakes!"The two boys reloaded their pistols with all rapidity, and this
was scarcely accomplished when they heard Cujo calling to them.When told of what had
happened he would not believe the tale until he had gone back to
look at the dead snake."Him big wonder um snake didn't kill
all of yo'!"He had located Captain
Villaire's party at the old fort, and said that several French
brigands were on guard, by the trail leading from the swamp and at
the cliff overlooking the river."I see white boy dare too," he added."Same boy wot yo' give
money to in Boma.""Can it be possible that he is
mixed up in this affair?""I can't understand it at all," returned Tom."But the question
is, now we have tracked the rascals, what is to be done next?"After a long talk it was resolved to get as close to the old fort
as possible.Cujo said they need not hurry, for it would be best
to wait until nightfall before making any demonstration against
their enemies.The African was very angry to think that the other
natives had deserted the party, but this anger availed them
nothing.Four o'clock in the afternoon found them on the edge of the swamp
and not far from the bank of the Congo.Beyond was the cliff,
overgrown in every part with rank vegetation, and the ever-present
vines, which hung down like so many ropes of green."If we want to get up the wall we won't want any scaling ladders,"
remarked Tom grimly."Oh, if only we knew that Dick and Uncle
Randolph were safe!""I'm going to find out pretty soon," replied Sam."I'll tell you
what I think.But I didn't dream of such a thing
being done down here although, I know it is done further north in
Africa among the Moors and Algerians."Cujo now went off on another scout and did not return until the
sun was setting."I can show you a way up de rocks," he said."We can get to the
walls of um fort, as you call um, without being seen."Soon night was upon them, for in the tropics there is rarely any
twilight.Tom now declared himself able to walk once more, and
they moved off silently, like so many shadows, beside the swamp
and then over a fallen palm to where a series of rocks, led up to
the cliff proper.They came to a halt, and through the gloom saw a solitary figure
sitting on a rock.The sentinel held a gun over his knees and was
smoking a cigarette."If he sees us he will give the alarm," whispered Tom."Can't we
capture him without making a noise?""Dat's de talk," returned Aleck."Cujo, let us dun try dat
trick.""Urn boys stay here," he said.And off he crawled through the wet grass, taking a circuitous
route which brought him up on the sentinel's left.As he did so Cujo leaped
from the grass and threw him to the earth.Then a long knife
flashed in the air."No speak, or um diet" came softly; but, the
Frenchman realized that the African meant what he said.he growled, in the language of the African.Cujo let out a low whistle, which the others rightly guessed was a
signal for them to come up.Finding himself surrounded, the
Frenchman gave up his gun and other weapons without a struggle.He could talk no English, so what followed had to be translated by
Cujo."Yes, de man an' boy are dare," explained Cujo, pointing to the
fort."Da chained up, so dis rascal say.De captain ob de band
want heap money to let um go.""Ask him how many of the band there are," asked Sam.But at this question the Frenchman shook his head.Either he did
not know or would not tell.After a consultation the rascal was made to march back to safer
ground.Then he was strapped to a tree and gagged.The straps
were not fastened very tightly, so that the man was sure to gain
his liberty sooner or later."If we didn't come back and he was
too tight he might starve to death," said Tom."Not but wot he deserves to starve," said Aleck, with a scowl at
the crestfallen prisoner.At the foot of the cliff all was as dark and silent as a tomb."We go slow now, or maybe take a big tumble," cautioned Cujo."Perhaps him better if me climb up first," and he began the
dangerous ascent of the cliff by means of the numerous vines
already mentioned.He was halfway up when the others started after him, Sam first,
Tom next, and Aleck bringing up in the rear.Slowly they arose until the surface of the stream was a score or
more of feet below them.Then came the sounds of footsteps from
above and suddenly a torch shone down into their upturned faces.came in English and the Rover boys recognized
Dan Baxter."How came you--"

"Silence, Baxter!I have a pistol and you know I am a good shot.Stand where you an and put both hands over your head."yelled the bully, and flung his torch
straight at Tom.Then he turned and ran for the fort, giving the
alarm at the top of his lungs.The torch struck Tom on the neck, and for the moment the youth was
in danger of losing his hold on the vines and tumbling to the
jagged rocks below.But then the torch slipped away, past Sam and
Aleck, and went hissing into the dark waters of the Congo.By this time Cujo had reached the top of the cliff and was making
after Baxter.Both gained the end of the fort at the same time and
one mighty blow from Cujo's club laid Baxter senseless near the
doorway.The cry came in Dick's voice, and was plainly
heard by Sam and Tom.Then Captain Villaire appeared, and a rough
and tumble battle ensued, which the Rovers well remember to this
day.But Tom was equal to the occasion, and after the first onslaught
he turned, as if summoning help from the cliff."Tell the company to come up here and the other company
can surround the swamp!"Several pistol shots rang out, and the boys saw a Frenchman go
down with a broken arm.Then Captain Villaire shouted: "We have
been betrayed--we must flee!"The cry came in French, and as if
by magic the brigands disappeared into the woods behind the old
fort; and victory was upon the side of our friends.CHAPTER XXI

INTO THE HEART OF AFRICA


"Well, I sincerely trust we have no more such adventures."He was seated on an old bench in
one of the rooms of the fort, binding up a finger which had been
bruised in the fray.It was two hours later, and the fight had
come to an end some time previous.Nobody was seriously hurt,
although Sam, Dick, and Aleck were suffering from several small
wounds.Aleck had had his ear clipped by a bullet from Captain
Villaire's pistol and was thankful that he had not been killed.Baxter, the picture of misery, was a prisoner.The bully's face
was much swollen and one eye was in deep mourning.He sat huddled
up in a heap in a corner and wondering what punishment would be
dealt out to him."I suppose they'll kill me," he groaned, and it
may be added that he thought he almost deserved that fate."You came just in time," said Dick."Captain Villaire was about
to torture us into writing letters home asking for the money he
wanted as a ransom.Baxter put it into his head that we were very
rich.""Oh, please don't say anything more about it!""I--that Frenchman put up this job all on
his own hook.""I don't believe it," came promptly from Randolph Rover."You met
him, at Boma; you cannot deny it.""So I did; but he didn't say he was going to capture you, and I--"

"We don't care to listen to your falsehoods, Baxter," interrupted
Dick sternly.Cujo had gone off to watch Captain Villaire and his party.He now
came back, bringing word that the brigand had taken a fallen tree
and put out on the Congo and was drifting down the stream along
with several of his companions in crime."Him won't come back," said the tall African."Him had enough of
urn fight."Nevertheless the whole party remained on guard until morning,
their weapons ready for instant use.But no alarm came, and when
day, dawned they soon made sure that they had the entire locality
around the old fort to themselves, the Frenchman with a broken arm
having managed to crawl off and reach his friends.What to do with Dan Baxter was a conundrum."We can't take him with us, and if we leave him behind he will
only be up to more evil," said Dick."We ought to turn him over
to the British authorities.""No, no, don't do that," pleaded the tall youth."Let me go and
I'll promise never to interfere with you again.""Your promises are not worth the breath used in uttering them,"
replied Tom."Baxter, a worse rascal than you could not be
imagined.Why don't you try to turn over a new leaf?""I will--if you'll only give me one more chance," pleaded the
former bully of Putnam Hall.The matter was discussed in private and it was at last decided to
let Baxter go, providing he would, promise to return straight to
the coast."And remember," said Dick, "if we catch you following us again we
will shoot you on sight.""I won't follow--don't be alarmed," was the low answer, and then
Baxter was released and conducted to the road running down to
Boma.He was given the knife he had carried, but the Rovers kept
his pistol, that he might not be able to take a long-range shot at
them.Soon he was out of their sight, not to turn up again for a
long while to come.It was not until the heat of the day had been spent that the
expedition resumed its journey, after, an excellent meal made from
the supplies Captain Villaire's party had left behind in their
hurried flight.Some of the remaining supplies were done up into
bundles by Cujo, to replace those which had been lost when the
natives hired by Randolph Rover had deserted."It's queer we didn't see anything of that man and woman from the
inn," remarked Dick, as they set off."I reckon they got scared
at the very start."They journeyed until long after nightfall, "To make up for lost
time," as Mr.Rover expressed it, and so steadily did Cujo push on
that when a halt was called the boys were glad enough to rest.They had reached a native village called Rowimu.Here Cujo was
well known and he readily procured good accommodations for all
hands.The next week passed without special incident, excepting that one
afternoon the whole party went hunting, bringing down a large
quantity of birds, and several small animals, including an
antelope, which to the boys looked like a Maine deer excepting for
the peculiar formation of its horns.said Tom, when they were
returning to camp from the hunt."Oh, I reckon he is blasting away at game," laughed Sam, and Tom
at once groaned over the attempted joke."Perhaps we will meet him some day--if he's in this territory,"
put in Dick."But just now I am looking for nobody but father.""And so are all of us," said Tom and Sam promptly.They were getting deeper and deeper into the jungle and had to
take good care that they did not become separated.Yet Cujo said
he understood the way perfectly and often proved his words by
mentioning something which they would soon reach, a stream, a
little lake, or a series of rocks with a tiny waterfall."Been ober dis ground many times," said the guide."I suppose this is the ground Stanley covered in his famous
expedition along the Congo," remarked Dick, as they journeyed
along."But who really discovered the country, Uncle Randolph?""That is a difficult question to answer, Dick.The Portuguese,
the Spanish, and the French all claim that honor, along with the
English.I fancy different sections, were discovered by different
nationalities.This Free State, you know, is controlled by half a
dozen nations.""I wonder if the country will ever be thoroughly civilized?""It will take a long while, I am afraid.Many of the tribes in Africa are, you must
remember, without any form of religion whatever, being even worse
than what we call heathens, who worship some sort of a God."And their morality is of the lowest grade in
consequence.They murder and steal whenever the chance offers,
and when they think the little children too much care for them
they pitch them into the rivers for the crocodiles to feed upon.""Well, I reckon at that rate,
civilization can't come too quick, even if it has to advance
behind bayonets and cannon."CHAPTER XXII

A HURRICANE IN THE JUNGLE


On and on went the expedition.In the past many small towns and
villages had been visited where there were more or less white
people; but now they reached a territory where the blacks held
full sway, with--but this was rarely--a Christian missionary
among them.At all of the places which were visited Cujo inquired about King
Susko and his people, and at last learned that the African had
passed to the southeast along the Kassai River, driving before him
several hundred head of cattle which he had picked up here and
there."Him steal dat cattle," explained Cujo, "but him don't say dat
stealin', him say um--um--"

"A tax on the people?""He must be, unless he gives the people some benefit for the tax
they are forced to pay," said Tom.At one of the villages they leaned that there was another
American Party in that territory, one sent out by an Eastern
college to collect specimens of the flora of central Africa.It
was said that the party consisted of an elderly man and half a
dozen young fellows."I wouldn't mind meeting that crowd," said Sam."They might
brighten up things a bit.""Never mind; things will pick up when once we meet King Susko,"
said Dick."But I would like to know where the crowd is from and
who is in it.""It's not likely we would know them if they are from the East,"
said Sam.Two days later the storm which Cujo had predicted for some time
caught them while they were in the midst of an immense forest of
teak and rosewood.It was the middle of the afternoon, yet the
sky became as black as night, while from a distance came the low
rumble of thunder.There was a wind rushing high up in the air,
but as yet this had not come down any further than the treetops.The birds of the jungle took up the alarm and filled the forest
with their discordant cries, and even the monkeys, which were now
numerous, sit up a jabber which would have been highly trying to
the nerves of a nervous person."Yes, we catch um," said Cujo, in reply to Dick's question."Me
look for safe place too stay.""You think the storm will be a heavy one?""Werry heavy, massah; werry heavy," returned Cujo."Come wid me,
all ob you,"  and he set off on a run.All followed as quickly as they could, and soon found themselves
under a high mass of rocks overlooking the Kassai River.They had
hardly gained the shelter when the storm burst over their heads in
all of its wild fury."My, but this beats anything that I ever saw before!"cried Sam,
as the wind began to rush by them with ever-increasing velocity."Him blow big by-me-by," said Cujo with a sober face."The air was full of a moanin' sound," to use Aleck's way of
expressing it.It came from a great distance and caused the
monkeys and birds to set up more of a noise than ever.The trees
were now swaying violently, and presently from a distance came a
crack like that of a big pistol.asked Randolph Rover, and Cujo
nodded."It is a good thing, then, that we got out of the
forest.""Big woods werry dangerous in heap storm like dis," answered the
African.He crouched down between two of the largest rocks and instinctively
the others followed suit.The "moanin" increased until, with a
roar and a rush, a regular tropical hurricane was upon them.The blackness of the atmosphere was filled with flying tree
branches and scattered vines, while the birds, large and small,
swept past like chips on a swiftly flowing river, powerless to
save themselves in those fierce gusts.shouted Randolph Rover; but the roar
of the elements drowned out his voice completely.However, nobody
thought of rising, and the tree limbs and vines passed harmlessly
over their heads.The first rush of wind over, the rain began, to fall, at first in
drops as big as a quarter-dollar and then in a deluge which
speedily converted the hollows among the rocks into deep pools and
soaked everybody to his very skin.Soon the water was up to their
knees and pouring down into the river like a regular cataract."This is a soaker and no mistake," said Sam, during a brief lull
in the downpour."Why, I never saw so much water come down in my
life.""It's a hurricane," answered Randolph Rover, "It may keep on--"

He got no further, for at that instant a blinding flash of
lightning caused everybody to jump in alarm.Then came an
ear-splitting crack of thunder and up the river they saw a
magnificent baobab tree, which had reared its stately head over a
hundred feet high from the ground, come crashing down, split in
twain as by a Titan's ax.The blackened stump was left standing,
and soon--this burst into flames, to blaze away until another
downpour of rain put out the conflagration.murmured Aleck with a shiver."Ise
glad we didn't take no shelter under dat tree."He had been on the point of making some joke
about the storm, but now the fun was knocked completely out of
him.It rained for the rest of the day and all of the night, and for
once all hands felt thoroughly, miserable.Several times they
essayed to start a fire, by which to dry themselves and make
something hot to drink, but each time the rain put out the blaze.What they had to eat was not only cold, but more or less
water-soaked, and it was not until the next noon that they managed to
cook a meal.When at last the sun did come out, however, it shone, so Sam put
it, "with a vengeance."There was not a cloud left, and the
direct rays of the great orb of day caused a rapid evaporation of
the rain, so that the ground seemed to be covered with a sort of
mist.On every side could be seen the effects of the hurricane-broken
trees, washed-out places along the river, and dead birds
and small animals, including countless monkeys.The monkeys made
the boys' hearts ache, especially one big female, that was found
tightly clasping two little baby monkeys to her breast.The storm had swollen the river to such an extent that they were
forced to leave the beaten track Cujo had been pursuing and take
to another trail which reached out to the southward.Here they
passed a small village occupied entirely by <DW64>s, and Cujo
learned from them that King Susko had passed that way but five
days before.He had had no cattle with him, the majority of his
followers having taken another route.It was thought by some of
the natives that King Susko was bound for a mountain known as the
Hakiwaupi--or Ghost-of-Gold."Can that be the mountain
father was searching for when he came to Africa?"Inquiries from Cujo elicited the information that the mountain
mentioned was located about one hundred miles away, in the center
of an immense plain.It was said to be full of gold, but likewise
haunted by the ghost of a departed warrior known to the natives as
Gnu-ho-mumoli--Man-of-the-Gnu-eye."I reckon that ghost story, was started, by somebody who wanted,
to keep the wealth of che mountain to himself," observed Tom."I
don't believe in ghosts, do you, Cujo?"The tall African shrugged his ebony shoulders, "Maybe no ghost--but
if dare is, no want to see 'um," he said laconically.Nevertheless he did not object to leading them in the direction of
the supposedly haunted mountain.So far the natives had been more or less friendly, but now those
that were met said but little to Cujo, while scowls at the whites
were frequent.It was learned that the college party from the
East was in the vicinity."Perhaps they did something to offend the natives," observed
Randolph Rover."As you can see, they are simple and childlike in
their ways, and as quickly offended on one hand as they are
pleased on the other.All of you must be careful in your
treatment of them, otherwise we may get into serious trouble."CHAPTER XXIII

DICK MEETS AN OLD ENEMY


One afternoon Dick found himself alone near the edge of a tiny
lake situated on the southern border of the jungle through which
the party had passed.The others had gone up the lake shore,
leaving him to see what he could catch for supper.He had just hooked a magnificent fish of a reddish-brown color,
when, on looking up, he espied an elderly man gazing at him
intently from a knoll of water-grass a short distance away."Richard Rover, is it--ahem--possible?"came slowly from the
man's thin lips.ejaculated Dick, so surprised that he let the
fish fall into the water again."How on earth did you get out
here?""I presume I might--er--ask that same question," returned the
former teacher of Putnam Hall."Do you imagine I would be fool enough to do that, Mr.No, the Stanhopes and I were content to let you go--so long as
you minded your own business in the future.""Do not grow saucy, boy; I will not stand it.""I am not saucy, as you see fit to term it, Josiah Crabtree.You
know as well as I do that you ought to be in prison this minute
for plotting the abduction of Dora.""I know nothing of the kind, and will not waste words on you.But
if you did not follow me why are you here?""I am here on business, and not ashamed to own it."And you--did you come in search of your missing
father?"It is a long journey for one so
young.""It's a queer place for you to come to.""I am with an exploring party from Yale College.We are studying
the fauna and flora of central Africa--at least, they are doing
so under my guidance.""They must be learning a heap--under you.""Do you mean to say I am not capable of teaching them!"cried
Josiah Crabtree, wrathfully."Well, if I was in their place I would want somebody else besides
the man who was discharged by Captain Putnam and who failed to get
the appointment he wanted at Columbia College because he could not
stand the examination."fumed Crabtree,
coming closer and shaking, his fist in Dick's face."Well, I know something of your lack of ability.""You are doing your best to insult me!""Such an old fraud as you cannot be insulted, Josiah Crabtree.I
read your real character the first time I met you, and you have
never done anything since which has caused me to alter my opinion
of you.You have a small smattering of learning and you can put
on a very wise look when occasion requires.But that is all there
is to it, except that behind it all you are a thorough-paced
scoundrel and only lack a certain courage to do some daring bit of
rascality."This statement of plain truths fairly set Josiah Crabtree to
boiling with rage.He shook his fist in Dick's face again."Don't
dare to talk that way, Rover; don't dare--or--I'll--I'll--"

"What will you do?""Never mind; I'll show you when the proper time comes.""I told you once before that I was not afraid of you--and I am
not afraid of you now.""You did not come to Africa alone, did you?"I tell you that--and it's the
truth--so that you won't try any underhand game on me.""You--you--"  Josiah Crabtree broke off and suddenly grew
nervous."See here, Rover, let us be friends," he said abruptly."Let us drop the past and be friends-at least, so long as we are
so far away from home and in the country of the enemy."Certainly the man's manner would indicate as much."Well, I'm willing to let past matters, drop--just for the
present," he answered, hardly knowing what to say."I wish to pay
all my attention to finding my father.""Exactly, Richard--and--er--you--who is with you?And that black, how is it he came along?""They are a set of rich young students from Yale in their senior
year who engaged me to bring them hither for study
and--er--recreation.You will
not--ahem--say anything about the past to them, will you?"CHAPTER XXIV

JOSIAH CRABTREE MAKES A MOVE


As quick as a flash of lightning Dick saw through Josiah Crabtree's
scheme for, letting matters Of the past drop.The former teacher
of Putnam Hall was afraid the youth would hunt up the college
students from Yale and expose him to them.As a matter of fact, Crabtree was already "on the outs" with two
of the students, and he was afraid that if the truth regarding his
character became known his present position would be lost to him
and he would be cast off to shift for himself."You don't want me to speak to the students under your charge?""Oh, of course you can speak to them, if you wish.But I--ahem--I
would not care to--er--er--"

"To let them know what a rascal you are," finished Dick."Crabtree, let me tell you once for all, that you can expect no
friendship, from me.When I meet those
students I will tell them whatever I see fit."At these words Josiah Crabtree grew as white as a sheet.Then,
setting his teeth, he suddenly recovered.As was perfectly natural, Dick turned to gaze in the direction.As he did so, Crabtree swung a stick that he carried into the air
and brought it down with all force on the youth's head.Dick felt
a terrific pain, saw a million or more dancing lights flash
through his brain--and then he knew no more."I guess I've fixed him," muttered the former teacher of Putnam
Hall grimly.He knelt beside the fallen boy and felt of his
heart."Not dead, but pretty well knocked out.Now what had I
best do with him?"He thought for a moment, then remembered a deep hollow which he
had encountered but a short while before.Gazing around, to make
certain that nobody was watching him, he picked up the unconscious
lad and stalked off with the form, back into the jungle and up a
small hill.At the top there was a split between the rocks and dirt, and into
this he dropped poor Dick, a distance of twenty or more feet.Then he threw down some loose leaves and dead tree branches."Now I reckon I am getting square with those Rovers," he muttered,
as he hurried away.The others of the Rover party wondered why Dick did not join them
when they gathered around the camp-fire that night."He must be done fishing by this time," said Tom."I wonder if
anything has happened to him?""Let us take a walk up de lake an' see," put in Aleck, and the
pair started off without delay.They soon found the spot where Dick had been fishing.His rod and
line lay on the bank, just as he had dropped it upon Josiah
Crabtree's approach.Then, to Tom's astonishment, a
strange voice answered from the woods: "Here I am!"Dat aint Dick," muttered Aleck."Dat's sumbuddy else, Massah
Tom.""So it is," replied Tom, and presently saw a tall and well-built
young man struggling forth from the tall grass of the jungle.demanded the newcomer, as he stalked toward
them."I guess I can ask the same question," laughed Tom."Are you the
Dick who just answered me?"I am looking for my brother Dick, who was fishing
here a while ago.Are you one of that party of college students we
have heard about?""Yes, I'm a college student from Yale."We can't imagine what
has become of my brother Dick," he went on."Perhaps a lion ate him up," answered the Yale student."No, you
needn't smile.He used to be a teacher at the
academy I and my brothers attend."I have thought so
all along, but the others, would hardly believe it.""I am telling the truth, and can prove all I say.But just now I
am anxious about my brother.Crabtree was scared to
death and ran away.Frank Rand and I took shots at the beast, but
I can't say if we hit him.""It would be too bad if Dick dunh fell into dat lion's clutches,"
put in Aleck."I reckon de lion would chaw him up in no time.""Go back and call Cujo," said Tom."He may be able to track my
brother's footsteps."While he was gone Tom told Dick Chester
much concerning himself, and the college student related several
facts in connection with the party to which he belonged."There are six of us students," he said."We were going to have a
professor from Yale with us, but he got sick at the last moment
and we hired Josiah Crabtree.I wish we hadn't done it now, for
he has proved more of a hindrance than a help, and his real
knowledge of fauna and flora could be put in a peanut shell, with
room to spare.""He's a big brag," answered Tom."Take my advice and never trust
him too far--or you may be sorry for it."Presently Aleck came back, with Cujo following.The brawny
African began at once to examine the footprints along the lake
shore.Udder footprints walk away, but not um Massah Dick."Do you think he--fell into the lake?""Perhaps, Massah Tom--or maybe he get into boat.""I don't know of any boats around here--do
you?""No," returned the young man from Yale."But the natives living
in the vicinity may have them.""Perhaps a native dun carry him off," said Aleck."He must be
sumwhar, dat am certain.""Yes, he must be somewhere," repeated Tom sadly.By this time Sam and Randolph Rover were coming up, and also one
of Dick Chester's friends.The college students were introduced
to the others by Tom, and then a general hunt began for Dick,
which lasted until the shades of night had fallen.But poor Dick
was not found, and all wondered greatly what had, become of him.Tom and the others retired at ten o'clock.But not to sleep, for
with Dick missing none of the Rovers could close an eye."We must
find him in the morning," said Sam.CHAPTER XXV

DICK AND THE LION


When poor Dick came to his senses he was lying in a heap on the
decayed leaves at the bottom of the hollow between the rocks.The
stuff Josiah Crabtree had thrown down still lay on top, of him,
and it was a wonder that he had not been smothered.was the first thought which crossed his
confused mind.He tried to sit up, but found this impossible
until he had scattered the dead leaves and tree branches.Even
then he was so bewildered that he hardly knew what to do,
excepting to stare around at his strange surroundings.Slowly the
truth dawned upon him--how Josiah Crabtree had struck him down
on the lake shore."He must have brought me here," he murmured.Although Dick did not know it, he had been at the bottom of the
hollow all evening and all night.The sun was now up once more,
but it was a day later than he imagined.The hollow was damp and full of ants and other insects, and as
soon as he felt able the youth got up.There was a big lump
behind his left ear where the stick had descended, and this hurt
not a little."I'll get square with him some day," he muttered, as he tried to
crawl out of the hollow."He has more courage to play the villain
than I gave him credit for.Sometime I'll face him again, and
then things will be different."It was no easy matter to get out of the hollow.The sides were
steep and slippery, and four times poor Dick tried, only to slip
back to the bottom.He was about to try a fifth time, when a
sound broke upon his ears which caused him great alarm.From only
a short distance away came the muffled roar of a lion.Dick had never heard, this sound out in the open before, but he
had heard it a number of times at the circus and at the menagerie
in Central Park, New York, and he recognized the roar only too
well.I trust he isn't coming this
way!"But he was coming that way, as Dick soon discovered.A few
seconds of silence were followed by another roar which to, the
alarmed youth appeared to come from almost over his head.Then
came a low whine, which was kept up for fully a minute, followed
by another roar.Dick hardly knew what was best--to remain at
the bottom of the hollow or try to escape to some tree at the top
of the opening."If I go up now he may nab me on sight," he
thought dismally."Oh, if only I had my--thank Heaven, I have!"Dick had felt for his pistol before, to find it gone.But now he
spotted the glint of the shiny barrel among the leaves.The
weapon had fallen from his person at the time Crabtree had pitched
him into the hollow.He reached for it, and to his joy found that
it was fully loaded and ready for use.Presently he heard the bushes overhead thrust aside, and then came
a half roar, half whine that made him jump.Looking up, he saw a
lion standing on the edge of the hollow facing him.The monarch of the forest was holding one of his forepaws up and
now he sat down on his haunches to lick the limb.Then he set up
another whine and shook the limb painfully."He has hurt that paw," thought Dick.Yes, he did see, just at that instant, and started back in
astonishment.Then his face took on a fierce look and he gave a
roar which could be heard for miles around.It was the report of Dick's pistol, but the youth was
nervous, and the bullet merely glanced along the lion's body,
doing little or no damage.The beast roared again, then crouched
down and prepared to leap upon the youth.But the wounded forepaw was a hindrance to the lion's movements,
and he began to crawl along the hollow's edge, seeking a better
point from which to make a leap.Then Dick's pistol spoke up a second time.This shot was a far better one, and the bullet passed directly
through the knee-joint of the lion's left forepaw.He was now
wounded in both fore limbs, and set up a roar which seemed to
fairly make the jungle tremble.Twice he started to leap down
into the hollow, but each time retreated to shake one wounded limb
after another into the air with whines of pain and distress.As soon as the great beast reappeared once more Dick continued his
firing.Soon his pistol was empty, but the lion had not been hit
again.In nervous haste the lad started to re-load only to find
that his cartridge box was empty.he yelled at the lion, and threw a stone at the beast.But the lion was now determined to descend into the hollow, and
paused only to calculate a sure leap to the boy's head.But that pause, brief as it was, was fatal to the calculations of
the monarch of the jungle.From his rear came two shots in rapid
succession, each hitting him in a vulnerable portion of his body.He leaped up into the air, rolled over on the edge of the hollow,
and then came down, head first, just grazing Dick's arm, and
landing at the boy's feet, stone dead."And so did I," came from Randolph Rover.cried Dick, with all the strength he could
command.He was shaking like a reed in the wind and all of the
color had deserted his face."I told you that I had heard several
pistol shots."Rover presented themselves at the top of the
hollow, followed by Aleck and Cujo.The latter procured a rope
made of twisted vines, and by this Dick was raised up without much
difficulty.CHAPTER XXVI

THE LAST OF JOSIAH CRABTREE


All listened intently to the story Dick had to tell, and he had
not yet finished when Dick Chester presented himself, having been
attracted to the vicinity by the roars of the lion and the various
pistol and gun shots."This Crabtree must certainly be as bad as you represent," he
said."I will have a talk with him when I get back to our camp.""It won't be necessary for you to talk to him," answered Dick
grimly."If you'll allow me, I'll do the talking."Chester and Cujo descended into the hollow to examine the lion.There was a bullet in his right foreleg which Chester proved had
come from his rifle."He must be the beast Frank Rand and I fired
at from across the lake.Probably he had his home in the hollow
and limped over to it during the night.""In that case you are entitled to your fair share of the meat--if
you wish any," said Randolph Rover with a smile."But I think
the pelt goes to Tom, for he fired the shot that was really
fatal."And that skin did go to Tom, and lies on his parlor floor
at home today."Several of the students from Yale had been out on a long tour the
afternoon before, in the direction, of the mountain, and they had
reported meeting several natives who had seen King Susko.He was
reported to have but half a dozen of his tribe with him, including
a fellow known as Poison Eye."That's a bad enough title for anybody," said Sam with a shudder."I suppose his job is to poison their enemies if they can't
overcome them in regular battle.""Um tell de thruf," put in Cujo."Once de Mimi tribe fight King
Susko, and whip him.Den Susko send Poison Eye to de Mimi camp.Next day all drink-water get bad, an' men, women, an' children die
off like um flies.""And why didn't they slay the poisoner?""Eberybody 'fraid to touch him--'fraid he be poisoned.""I'd run my chances--providing I had a knife or a club,"
muttered Tom."Such rascals are not fit to live."Dick, as can readily be imagined, was hungry, and before the party
started back for the lake, the youth was provided with some food
which Aleck had very thoughtfully carried with him.It was learned that the two parties were encamped not far apart,
and Dick Chester said he would bring his friends to, see them
before the noon hour was passed."I don't believe he will bring Josiah Crabtree," said Tom."I
reckon Crabtree will take good care to keep out of sight."When Chester came over with his friends he said
that the former teacher of Putnam Hall was missing, having left
word that he was going around the lake to look for a certain
species of flower which so far they had been unable to add to
their specimens."But he will have to come back," said the Vale student."He has
no outfit with which to go it alone."Crabtree put in an appearance just before the sun
set over the jungle to the westward.He presented a most woebegone
appearance, having fallen into a muddy swamp on his face."I--I met with an--an unfortunate accident," he said to
Chester."I fell into the--ahem--mud, and it was only with
great difficulty that I managed to--er--to extricate myself.""Josiah Crabtree, you didn't expect to see me here, did you?"said
Dick sternly, as he stepped forward.And then the others of his
party also came out from where they had been hiding in the brush.The former teacher of Putnam Hall started as if confronted by a
ghost."Why--er--where did you come from, Rover?""You know well enough where I came from, Josiah Crabtree," cried
Dick wrathfully."You dropped me into the hollow for dead, didn't
you!""Why, I--er--that--is--" stammered Crabtree; but could
actually go no further."Don't waste words on him, Dick," put in Tom."Give him the
thrashing he deserves.""If we were in America I would
have you locked up.But out here we must take the law into our
own hands.I am going to thrash you to the very best of my
ability, and after that, if I meet you again I'll--I'll--"

"Dun shoot him on sight," suggested Aleck."Chester--Rand--will you not aid me against this--er--savage
young brute?""Don't you call Dick a brute," put in Sam."If there is any brute here it is you, and everyone in our party
will back up what I say."Crabtree, I have nothing to say in this matter," said Dick
Chester."It would seem that your attack on Rover was a most
atrocious one, and out here you will have to take what punishment
comes.""But you will help me, won't you, Rand?"pleaded the former
teacher, nervously."No, I shall stand by Chester," answered Rand."And will you, too, see me humiliated?"asked Crabtree, turning to
the other Yale students."I, the head of your expedition into
equatorial Africa!"Crabtree, we may as well come to an understanding," said one
of the students, a heavyset young man named Sanders."We hired
you to do certain work for us, and we paid you well for that work.Since we left America you have found fault with nearly everything,
and in a good many instances which I need not recall just now you
have not done as you agreed.You are not the learned scientist
you represented yourself to be--instead, if we are to believe
our newly made friends here, you are a pretender, a big sham, and
a brute in the bargain.This being so, we intend to dispense with
your services from this day forth.We will pay you what is coming
to you, give you your share of our outfit, and then you can go
your way and we will go ours.We absolutely want nothing more to
do with you."This long speech on Sanders' part was delivered amid a deathlike
silence.As the student went on, Josiah Crabtree bit his lip
until the blood came.Once his baneful eyes fairly flashed fire
at Sanders and then at Dick Rover, but then they fell to the
ground."And so you--ahem--throw me off," he said, drawing a long
breath.But I demand all that is coming to me.""And a complete outfit, so that I can make my way back to the
coast.""All that is coming to you--no more and no less," said Sanders
firmly."But he shan't go without that thrashing!"cried Dick, and
catching up a long whip he had had Cujo cut for him he leaped upon
Josiah Crabtree and brought down the lash with stinging effect
across the former teacher's face, leaving a livid mark that
Crabtree was doomed to wear to the day of his death.And there is another for the way you treated Stanhope, and
another for what you did to Dora, and one for Tom, and another for
Sam, and another--"

"Oh!shrieked Crabtree, trying
to run away."Don't--I will be cut to pieces!And as the lash came down over his head, neck, and shoulders, he
danced madly around in pain.At last he broke for cover and
disappeared, not to show himself again until morning, when he
called Chester to him, asked for and received, what was coming to
him, and departed, vowing vengeance on the Rovers and all of the
others."He will remember you for that, Dick," said Sam, when the affair
was over."Let him be--I am not afraid of him," responded the elder
brother.CHAPTER XXVII

THE JOURNEY TO THE MOUNTAIN


By noon of the day following the Rover expedition was on its way
to the mountain said to be so rich in gold.The students from
Yale went with them."It's like a romance, this search after your father," said Chester
to Dick.You can rest assured that our
party will do all we can for you.Specimen hunting is all well
enough, but man hunting is far more interesting.""I would like to go on a regular hunt for big game some day," said
Tom.He had already mentioned Mortimer Blaze to the Yale
students."Yes, that's nice--if you are a crack shot, like Sanders.He
can knock the spots from a playing card at a hundred yards.""Maybe he's a Western boy," laughed Sam.His father owns a big cattle ranch there, and Sanders
learned to shoot while rounding up cattle.He's a tip-top
fellow."They had passed over a small plain and were now working along a
series of rough rocks overgrown with scrub brush and creeping
vines full of thorns.The thorns stuck everybody but Cujo, who
knew exactly how to avoid them."Ise dun got scratched in'steen thousand places," groaned Aleck."Dis am worse dan a bramble bush twice ober, by golly!"For two days the united expeditions kept on their way up the
mountain side,  which sloped gradually at its base, the steeper
portion still being several days' journey distant.During these days they shot several wild animals including a
beautiful antelope, while Sam caught a monkey.But the monkey bit
the boy in the shoulder, and Sam was glad enough to get rid of the
mischievous creature.On the afternoon of the second day Cujo, who was slightly in
advance of the others, called a halt."Two men ahead ob us, up um mountain," he said."Cujo Vink one of
dern King Susko."The discovery was talked over for a few minutes, and it was
decided that Cujo should go ahead, accompanied by Randolph Rover
and Dick.The others were to remain on guard for anything which
might turn up.Dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he advanced with his uncle and
the African guide through the tangle of thorns and over the rough
rocks.He felt that by getting closer to King Susko, he was also
getting closer to the mystery which surrounded his father's
disappearance."See, da is gwine up
into a big hole in de side ob de mountain?""Can you make out if it is Susko or not?""Not fo' certain, Massah Dick.But him belong to de Burnwo tribe,
an' de udder man too.""If they are all alone it will be an easy matter to capture them,"
said Randolph Rover."All told, we are twelve to two.""Come on, and we'll soon know something worth knowing, I feel
certain of it."Cujo now asked that he be allowed to proceed alone, to make
certain that no others of the Burnwo tribe were in the vicinity."We must be werry careful," he said."Burnwos kill eberybody wot
da find around here if not dare people.""Evidently they want to keep the whole mountain of gold to
themselves," observed Dick."All right, Cujo, do as you think
best--I know we can rely upon you."After this they proceeded with more care than ever-along a rocky
edge covered with loose stones.To one side was the mountain, to
the other a sheer descent of several hundred feet, and the
footpath was not over a yard wide."A tumble here would be a serious matter," said Randolph Rover."Take good care, Dick, that you don't step on a rolling stone."But the ledge was passed in safety, and in fifteen minutes more
they were close to the opening is the side of the mountain.It
was an irregular hole about ten feet wide and twice as high.The
a rocks overhead stuck out for several yards, and from these hung
numerous vines, forming a sort of Japanese curtain over the
opening.While the two Rovers waited behind a convenient rock, Cujo crawled
forward on his hand and knees into the cave.They waited for ten
minutes, just then it seemed an hour, but he did not reappear."He is taking his time," whispered Dick."Perhaps something has happened to him," returned Randolph Rover."I've had my pistol ready all along," answered the boy, exhibiting
the weapon."That encounter with the lion taught me a lesson.Dick broke off short, for a sound on the rocks above the cave
entrance had reached his ears.Both gazed in the direction, but
could see nothing."I heard a rustling in the bushes up there perhaps, though, it was
only a bird or some small animal.""Neither can I; but I am certain--Out of sight, Uncle Randolph,
quick!"Dick caught his uncle by the arm, and both threw themselves flat
behind the rocks.Scarcely had they gone down than two spears
came whizzing forward, one hitting the rocks and the other sailing
over their heads and burying itself in a tree trunk several yards
away.They caught a glance of two natives on the rocks over them,
but with the launching of the spears the Africans disappeared.CHAPTER XXVIII

KING SUSKO


"My gracious, this is getting at close range!"burst out Dick,
when he could catch his breath again."Uncle Randolph, they meant
to kill us!"Take care that they do not spear
you."No reply came back to this call, which was several times repeated.Then came a crash, as a big stone was hurled down, to split into a
score of pieces on the rock which sheltered them."They mean to dislodge us," said Dick."If they would only show
themselves--"

He stopped, for he had seen one of the Bumwos peering over a mass
of short brush directly over the cave entrance.Taking hasty aim
with his pistol be fired.A yell of pain followed, proving that the African had been hit.But the Bumwo was not seriously wounded, and soon he sent another
stone at them, this time hitting Randolph Rover on the leg.gasped Dick's uncle, and drew up that member with a wry
face."Did he hurt you much, Uncle Randolph?"And now the man
fired, but the bullet flew wide of its mark, for Randolph Rover
had practiced but little with firearms.They now thought it time to retreat, and, watching their chance,
they ran from the rocks to the trees beyond.While they were
exposed another spear was sent after them, cutting its way through
Mr.Rover's hat brim and causing that gentleman to turn as pale as
a sheet."A few inches closer and it would have been my head!"Perhaps we
had better rejoin the others, Dick."The shots had alarmed the others of the expedition, and all were
hurrying along the rocky ledge when Randolph Rover and Dick met
them."If you go ahead
we may be caught in an ambush.The Bumwos have discovered our
presence and mean to kill us if they can!"Suddenly a loud, deep voice broke upon them, coming from the rocks
over the cave entrance."This
country belongs to the Bumwos."I am King Susko, chief of the Bumwos.""Will you come and have a talk with us?"Want the white man to leave," answered the
African chief, talking in fairly good English."We do not wish to quarrel with you, King Susko; but you will find
it best for you if you will grant us an interview," went on
Randolph Rover."The white man must go away from this mountain.I will not talk
with him," replied the African angrily."To rob the Bumwos of their gold.""No; we are looking for a lost man, one who came to this country
years ago and one who was your prisoner--"

"The white man is no longer here--he went home long time ago.""You have him a prisoner, and
unless you deliver him up you shall suffer dearly for it."This threat evidently angered the African chief greatly, for
suddenly a spear was launched at the boy, which pierced Tom's
shoulder.As Tom went down, a shout went up from the rocks, and suddenly a
dozen or more Bumwos appeared, shaking their spears and acting as
if they meant to rush down on the party below without further
warning.CHAPTER XXIX

THE VILLAGE ON THE MOUNTAIN


"Tom is wounded!"He ran to his brother, to find the
blood flowing freely over Tom's shoulder."I--I guess not," answered Tom with a gasp of pain.Then, as
full of pluck as usual, Tom raised his pistol and fired, hitting
one of the Bumwos in the breast and sending him to the rear,
seriously wounded.It was evident that Cujo had been mistaken and that there were far
more of their enemies around the mountain than they had
anticipated.From behind the Rover expedition a cry arose,
telling that more of the natives were coming from that direction."We are being hemmed in," said Dick Chester nervously."No, let us make a stand," came from Rand."I think a concerted
volley from our pistols and guns will check their movements."It was decided to await the closer approach of the Bumwos, and
each of the party improved the next minute in seeing to it that
his weapon was ready for use.Suddenly a blood-curdling yell arose on the sultry air, and the
Bumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions, at right
angles to each other.cried Dick Rover, and began to fire at one
of the approaching forces.The fight that followed was, however, short and full of
consternation to the Africans.One of the parties was led by King
Susko himself, and the chief had covered less than half the
distance to where the Americans stood when a bullet from Tom
Rover's pistol reached him, wounding him in the thigh and causing
him to pitch headlong on the grass.The fall of the leader made the Africans set up a howl of dismay,
and instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their
leader.Then, as the Americans continued to fire, they picked
King Susko up and ran off with him.A few spears were hurled at
our friends, but the whole battle, to use Sam's way of summing up
afterward, was a regular "two-for-a-cent affair."Soon the Bumwos
were out of sight down the mountain side.The first work of our friends after they had made certain that the
Africans had really retreated, was to attend to Tom's wound and
the bruise Randolph Rover had received from the stone.Fortunately
neither man nor boy was seriously hurt, although Tom carries the
mark of the spear's thrust to this day."But I don't care," said Tom."I hit old King Susko, and that was
worth a good deal, for it stopped the battle.If the fight had
kept on there is no telling how many of us might have been
killed."While the party was deliberating about what to do next, Cujo
reappeared."I go deep into de cabe when foah Bumwos come on me from behind,"
he explained."Da fight an' fight an' knock me down an' tie me wid vines, an'
den run away.But I broke loose from de vines an' cum just as
quick as could run.Werry big cabe dat, an' strange waterfall in
de back.""Let us explore the cave," said Dick."Somebody can remain on
guard outside."Some demurred to this, but the Rover boys could, not be held back,
and on they went, with Aleck with them.Soon Randolph Rover
hobbled after them, leaving Cujo and the college students to
remain on the watch.The cave proved to be a large affair, running all of half a mile
under the mountain.There were numerous holes in the roof,
through which the sun shone down, making the use of torches
unnecessary.To one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream,
coming from the waterfall Cujo had mentioned, and disappearing
under the rocks near the entrance to the cavern.shouted Dick, as he gazed on the walls of the
cave."You are, Dick; this is a regular cave of gold, and no mistake.No wonder King Susko wanted to keep us away!"It was a fascinating scene to
watch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of
fully a hundred feet.At the bottom was a pool where the water
was lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round.suddenly cried Sam, and pointed into
the falling water."Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you ever see anything
like it?""There are no such things as ghosts, Sam," replied his uncle."Stand here and look," answered Sam, and his uncle did as
requested.Presently from out of the mist came the form of a man--the
likeness of Randolph Rover himself!"It is nothing but an optical illusion, Sam, such as are produced
by some magicians on the theater stage.The sun comes down
through yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock, which
in turn reflects the form on the sheet of water."And that must be the ghost the natives believe in,"
answered Sam.I can tell you I was
startled.""Here is a path leading up past the waterfall," said Dick, who had
been making an investigation."Take care of where you go," warned Randolph Rover."There may be
some nasty pitfall there.""I'll keep my eyes open," responded Dick.He ascended the rocks, followed by Sam, while the others brought
up in the rear.Up over the waterfall was another cave, long and
narrow.There was now but little light from overhead, but far in
the distance could be seen a long, narrow opening, as if the
mountain top had been, by some convulsion of nature, split in
half."We are coming into the outer world again!"For beyond the opening was a small plain, covered with short grass
and surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the
height of fifty or sixty feet.In the center of the plain were a
number of native huts, of logs thatched with palm.CHAPTER XXX

FINDING THE LONG-LOST


"A village!""There are several women and children," returned Tom, pointing to
one of the huts."I guess the men went away to fight us."Let us investigate, but with
caution."As they advanced, the women and children set up a cry of alarm,
which was quickly taken up in several of the other huts."Go away, white men; don't touch us!"cried a voice in the purest
English.came from the three Rover boys, and they rushed off in
all haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded.Anderson Rover was found in the center of the hut, bound fast by a
heavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground.His face
was haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half
long, while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders.He was
dressed in the merest rags, and had evidently suffered much from
starvation and from other cruel treatment."Do I see aright, or
is it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain
lately?"burst out Dick, and hugged his parent
around the neck."It's no dream, father; we are really here," put in Tom, as he
caught one of the slender hands, while Sam caught the other.And then he added tenderly: "But
we'll take good care of you, now we have found you."murmured Anderson Rover, as the brother came up.and the tears began to
flow down his cheeks.Many a time I
thought to give up in despair!""We came as soon as we got that message you sent," answered Dick."But that was long after you had sent it.""And is the sailor, Converse, safe?""Too bad--he was the one friend I had here.""And King Susko has kept you a prisoner all this while?""Yes; and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain.He
imagined I knew all of the secrets of this mountain, of a gold
mine of great riches, and he would not let me go; but, instead,
tried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture.""We will settle accounts with him some day," muttered Dick."It's
a pity Tom didn't kill him."The native women and children were looking in at the doorway
curiously, not knowing what to say or do.Turning swiftly, Dick
caught one by the arm."The key to the lock," he demanded, pointing to the lock on the
iron chain which bound Anderson Rover.But the woman shook her head, and pointed off in the distance."King Susko has the key," explained Anderson Rover."You will
have to break the chain,"  And this was at last done, although not
without great difficulty.In the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for
Anderson Rover and all of the others, and Cujo was called that he
might question the Africans in their own language.The meal was soon forthcoming, the Bumwo women fearing that they
would be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of
the whites.To make sure that the food had not been poisoned,
Dick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish."Um know a good deal," he remarked."Cujo was goin' to tell Dick to do dat.""I am glad the women and children are here," said Randolph Rover."We can take them with us when we leave and warn King Susko that
if he attacks us we will kill them.I think he will rather let us
go than see all of the women and children slaughtered."While they ate, Anderson Rover told his story, which is far too
long to insert here.He had found a gold mine further up the
country and also this mountain of gold, but had been unable to do
anything since King Susko had made him and the sailor prisoners.During his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties, but all
this was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother
and his three sons.It was decided that the party should leave the mountain without
delay, and Cujo told the female natives to get ready to move.At
this they set up a loud protest, but it availed them nothing, and
they soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them
if they behaved.CHAPTER XXXI

HOME AGAIN--CONCLUSION


Nightfall found the entire expedition, including the women and
children, on the mountain side below the caves.As the party went
down the mountain a strict watch was kept for the Bumwo warriors,
and just as the sun was setting, they were discovered in camp on
the trail to the northwest."We will send out a flag of truce," said Randolph Rover.This was done, and presently a tall Bumwo under chief came out in
a plain to hold a mujobo, or "law talk."In a few words Cujo explained the situation, stating that they now
held in bondage eighteen women and children, including King
Susko's favorite wife Afgona.If the whites were allowed to pass
through the country unharmed until they, reached the village of
Kwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release
all of the women and children at that point and they could go back
to rejoin their husbands and fathers.If, on the other hand, the
expedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in
bondage to instant death.It is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put
into execution.As Dick said when relating the particulars of the
affair afterward."We couldn't have done such a terrible thing,
for it would not have been human."But the threat had the desired
effect, and in the morning King Susko, who was now on a sick bed,
sent word that they should go through unmolested.And go through they did, through jungles and over plains, across
rivers and lakes and treacherous swamps, watching continually for
their enemies, and bringing down many a savage beast that showed
itself.On the return they fell in with Mortimer Blaze, and he,
being a crack shot, added much to the strength of their command.At last Kwa was reached, and here they found themselves under the
protection of several European military organizations.The native
women and children were released, much to their joy, and my
readers can rest assured that these Africans lost no time in
getting back to that portion of the Dark Continent which they
called home.From Kwa to Boma the journey was comparatively easy.At Stanley
Pool they rested for a week, and all in the party felt the better
for it."Some day I will go back and open up the mines I have discovered,"
said Anderson Rover.I want to see my own dear
native land first."Josiah Crabtree had turned up and been
joined by Dan Baxter, and both had left for parts unknown."I hope we never see them again," said Dick, and his brothers said
the same.An American ship was in port, bound for Baltimore, and all of our
party, including the Yale students, succeeded in obtaining passage
on her for home.The trip was a most delightful one, and no days
could have been happier than those which the Rover boys spent
grouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the
numerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home.A long letter was written to Captain Townsend, telling of the
finding of Anderson Rover, and the master of the Rosabel was,
later on, sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to
the Rovers.Of course Anderson Rover was greatly interested in what his sons
had been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so
finely at Putnam Hall."We will let Arnold Baxter drop," he said."He is our enemy, I know; but just now we will let the law take
its course for the rascality he practiced in Albany.""We can afford to let him
drop, seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves.""And how happy we are going to be," chimed in Sam."And how rich--when father settles up that mining claim in the
West," put in Tom.Here I must bring to a finish the story of the Rover boys'
adventures in the jungles of Africa.They had started out to find
their father, and they had found him, and for the time being all
went well.The home-coming of the Rovers was the occasion of a regular
celebration at Valley Brook farm.The neighbors came in from far
and wide and with them several people from the city who in former
years had known Anderson Rover well.It was a time never to be forgotten, and the celebration was kept
up for several days.Captain Putnam was there, and with him came
Frank, Fred, Larry, and several others.The captain apologized
handsomely to Aleck for the way he had treated the <DW52> man."I wish I had been with you," said Fred."You Rover boys are
wonders for getting around."I think we'll go West next," answered Dick."Father wants to
look up his mining interests, you know.We are going to ask him
to take us along."They did go west, and what adventures they had
will be related in a new volume, entitled "The Rover Boys Out West;
or, The Search for a Lost Mine.""But we are coming back to Putnam Hall first," added Tom.I thought of it even in the heart of Africa!""And so did I," put in Sam."I'll tell you, fellows, it's good
enough to roam around, but, after all, there is no place like
home."And with this truthful remark from the youngest Rover, let us
close this volume, kind reader, hoping that all of us may meet
again in the next book of the series, to be entitled, "The Rover
Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine."In this story all
of our friends will once more play important parts, and we will
learn what the Baxters, father and son, did toward wresting the
Rover Boys' valuable mining property from them.But for the time
being all went well, and so good-by.there was a little too much way for me.When I came
to the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the
ladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise
and shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;
but I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas
trowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he
want to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then
I joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I
trust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an
utter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the
service--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the
first time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired
(at a marine, I think), "Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till
jine."The story bears "fib" on the face of it, for there is not a
Scottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any
more than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array
yourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and
sword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out
of the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see
the admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine
to point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to
show you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not
pull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which
would be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up
and shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk
respectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon
which he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of
returning the salute, while at the same time you say--

"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir."It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,
decided tone, placing the emphasis on the "_come_" to show clearly that
you _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought
you on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may
be learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,
"Dinner's ready, sir, please;" or it may be heard in the "Now then,
gents," of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not
expect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to
tea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has
not had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_
condescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;
but if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your
telling him, remark, "Humph!"then call the most minute midshipman to
conduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to
mispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you
Stutters."Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where
the gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.""Ay, ay, sir," says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging
you either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose
sight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much
from home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to
the wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the
present Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical
officer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the
naval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be
put up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the
mysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good
idea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt
the plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same
footing.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block
of brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in
front, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel
between, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent
of a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,
cooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,
consisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical
inspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of
regularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty
acting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing
duty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the
staff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,
where we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately
after, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little
board or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung
in a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were
thrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses "standing by."Up
each side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying
the progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or
suspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;
listening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,
and just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along
lengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,
and into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas
wards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a
little past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had
given us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a
bagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure
enough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without
meeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our
dinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at
once to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty
such good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,
as you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in
but a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--

  "--Party in a parlour cramm'd,
  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
  But, as you by their faces see,
  All silent--and all damned."I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several
occasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to
dance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector
whose house was adjoining, requesting us to "stop our _confounded_ row;"
but then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the
bottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon
as breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to
the receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye
the cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three
or four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an
assistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then
more red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during
the day.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case
is one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently
treated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper
ward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of
pills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,
verbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,
and the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate
account of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out
for him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's
dinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if
everything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or
eleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is
not yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night
through all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet
him, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at
ward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping
and keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the
slightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning
lights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as
soundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their
assistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to
the service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore
they treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole
profession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but
who, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or
lithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,
and so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily
ailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement."Well, sir," he cried; "I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into
the erysipelas ward."This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required
no answer."Is it true, sir?--is it true?""It is, sir," was the reply."And what do you mean by it, sir?he
exclaimed, waxing more and more wroth."I thought, sir--" I began."Yes, sir," continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, "I _did_
think that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I
was--"

"Erysipelatous ulcer!"said he, "that alters the
case.I beg your pardon;" and he
trotted off again."All right," thought I, "old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,
on being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore
less than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank
of commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every
year getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a
home hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital
of Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet
served the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be
dismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.A WORD ON BASS'S BEER.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end
of that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the
pleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my
passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put
in commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be
handed over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many
stones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical
officer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign
station; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and
strongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the
service, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in
such a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and
sailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged
at his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,
while the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,
shavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I
tumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for
the sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad
when I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a
very different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper
place, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and
clean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all
taut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water
saucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful
ensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,
had been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the
Sound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats
glided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled
with the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom
stores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two
sturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval
officer on top of it, grasping firmly a Cremona in one hand and holding
a hat-box in the other.The boat was filled with any number of smaller
packages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the
best of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress
uniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and
in a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted
creatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention
to the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the
officer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might
have been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a
matter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance
of his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out
for a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his
person into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a
matter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity
in the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month
of May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly
steamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with
the unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all
the afternoon.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting
to be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage
but slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on
the quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our
spirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to
gaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning
over the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the
Flying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I
see from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a
bright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in
motion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,
filled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;
the long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each
anxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the
affectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved
sweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear
that is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the
bosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,
people-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a
church "points the way to happier spheres," and on the flagstaff at the
port-admiral's house is floating the signal "Fare thee well."The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing
cheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the
wind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in
little groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,
and a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to
find."Yonder's my Poll, Jack," says one.the poor lass is
crying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.""There," says another, "is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the
old cove in the red nightcap.""That's my father, Bill," answers a third."God bless the dear old
chap?""Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I
don't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright."Dick, Dick," exclaims an honest-looking tar; "I see'd my poor wife
tumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?""Keep up your heart, to be sure," answers a tall, rough son of a gun."There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got
neither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be
making a noodle of myself; but where's the use?"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing
visible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of
Cornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on
their summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the
east, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and
chill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated
myself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the
discomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or
passenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I
been an admiral.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would
call a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not
rigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very
wretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in
small whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet
notwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and
body, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the
oldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last
found myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found
that the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along
before a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the
N.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had
seen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything
before, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful
night, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at
twelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to
light fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making
fourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,
the latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on
deck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking
badly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all
around was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the
roll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was
rolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable
wallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious
faces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so
great was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their
places.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small
cannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men
whose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and
sea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,
adding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and
other articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of
discovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the
fore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing
us to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven
canvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times
increased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the
lightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen
for one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the
consequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,
_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the
danger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the
wind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and
beautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow
of a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a
high mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and
verdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping
through the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,
surrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As
there was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal
amusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot
in mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,
getting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I
rode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I
looked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like
a leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the
horse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,
and a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of
coming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many
minutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a
terrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any
such accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being
Saint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to
conquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but
didn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,
and fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the
leg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle
of the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms
folded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the
unco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it
is too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and
its straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the
duty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to
make a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the "great man."I
have no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done
by dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall
merely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have
observed--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn
with _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself
there are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place
which John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,
whenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some
future day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty
beer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,
giving three hips!thrice, and singing "For he's a jolly
good fellow," without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly
fellow; also adding more decidedly "which nobody can deny"--there being
no one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,
without my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my
services.THE MODERN RODERICK RANDOM.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on
board a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,
and often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is
that officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you
happen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding
silently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your
watch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,
pray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your
servant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on
joining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the
same time,--

"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir," or "I'll do for you, sir."On
which you would reply,--

"All right!and he would answer "Cheeks," or whatever
his name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of
visionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering
in fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many
things,--"Nobody is to blame," and "Cheeks is to blame," being
synonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half
of a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is
found to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,
say, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,
and you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant
requires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one
which only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that
Alexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and
quietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking
all your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,
and shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and
brushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--

"Six bells, sir, please," remarks your man, laying his hand on your
elbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and
which will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once
from your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of
delicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own
breakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own
allowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of
cocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils
than flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs
you--

"Plenty of time, sir."Then," you inquire, "it isn't six bells?""Not a bit on it, sir," he replies; "wants the quarter."At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on
the lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward
isn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that
hour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the
waist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and
rubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare
back, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately
damns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill "at
his lark again."Another who is bending down over his tub you touch
more firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort
of tone to "slue round there."He "slues round," very quickly too, but
unfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a
tub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your
journey, and sing out as a general sort of warning--

For the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,
weevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size
and shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,
with a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,
but should think the flavour would be quite similar."Gangway there, lads," which causes at least a dozen of these worthies
to pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--

"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.""Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?""Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.""Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.""Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,"--while at the same
time it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within
the screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon
already seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work
is begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,
attached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the
brain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be
it spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger
brethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to
breakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,
is required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up
lifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection
the parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or
anything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on
shore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of
the officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in
case of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,
there is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for
example the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,
with a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,
Malays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost
landlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty
mountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard
sandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or
away up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can
surpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the
wild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel
and billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--
monkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If
you long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'
leave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with
the mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the
sun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could
do justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning
spread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a
plunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the
sea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the
water, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid
such scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving
climate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood
tingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the
extreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and
constitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose
yourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole
city at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have
mentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you
pass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house
buried in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving
forests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the
grape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable
farm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as
the country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few
pages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must
needs take the shadows also.ENEMY ON THE PORT BOW.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of
assistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If
you go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at
twelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or
gone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming
hour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in
establishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'
dinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner
does not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is
always pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are
evenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the
officers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by
previously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The
mess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the
victualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a
by-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever
changing hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain
amount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it
is scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please
him, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch
forth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing
all he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or
directly to the point.It is all under-the-table stabbing."Such and such a ship that I was in," says growler first, "and such and
such a mess--"

"Oh, by George!"says growler second, "_I_ knew that ship; that was a
mess, and no mistake?""Why, yes," replies number one, "the lunch we got there was better than
the dinner we have in this old clothes-basket."On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you
attend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the
service, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then
too everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it
is quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the
dinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And
after the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary
rap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the
evening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the
bandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the
last ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played "God
save the Queen," and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or
selections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll
over our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee
is served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas
smoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means
the least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the
succeeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,
in a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my
heart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last
visit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your
ease all the more when you have done.So the evening wears away, and by
ten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy
thoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at
half-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,
for now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically
sealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first
one may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the
cradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;
you had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well
you knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or
deadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very
improbable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as
you are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,
mingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you
start and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes
again, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,
high over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down
of hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars
falling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the
voice of the commander thundering, "Enemy on the port bow;" and then,
and not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly
night-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real
enemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,
with the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live
thunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed
away.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of
wine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,
begin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to
amputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or
cabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself
on fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the
same time singing out at the top of his voice, "Man overboard."A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the
main hatchway, "Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede
the battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their
God.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there
asleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a
rattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in
the water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow
from a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life
of the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his
own place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of
assistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,
after reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was
very soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman
who was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death
vacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the
bright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had
enjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a
gunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a
pigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in
fact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without
breadth, and small enough to have done "excellently well" as a Gravesend
tug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a
65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking
these, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian
Ocean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the
very heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar
of our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves
should clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best
of all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to
spend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."Evidently to
his honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes
to get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a
punctual man all my life, ma'am," added he, half apologetically, till
I suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had
liked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final
pointing across the street, "There's my shop, ladies, if you would care
to look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its
ancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but
night was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a
most untempting meal, and hurried Charles's departure, lest we should
be benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and
unlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done
our duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we
laughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that
the man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all
those notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH


The last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a
starless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael's Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,
if after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,
the day on which we went to the Land's End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some
of us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so
till the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out
on the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point
of gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare
enough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted
for the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering
sun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last
time, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land's End would
be like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out
the truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead
of a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through
Penzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along
to morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage
to go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen's, which we knew
by report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted
with had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised
faithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall
never forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely
roads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about
Penzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the
high promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was
now all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer
leaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three
children trotting to school or church, with their books under their
arms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;
religious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist
sects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church
of England.Buryan's--a curious old church founded on the place where
an Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A
few stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing
special to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and
sunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the
celebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in
England of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,
who can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,
  But all earth's powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant
Goldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat's
crew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point
on which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at
great labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked
properly since.By Charles's advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who
stalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the
Lizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a
labyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You'll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of
them in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide's hand been
much readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even
so far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat
anxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that
enormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the
lovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must
honestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones
around it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most
adventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain
relief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms
broken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land's End is said to be one
of the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,
Pardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought
to see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a
dull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and
ugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of
a village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came
forward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief
exclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more
when we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of
an hour at the Land's End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too
daintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour
of the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great
Britain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a
sympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It's very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our
contrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the
house, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme
end of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further
into the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things
innumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who
is Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,
one seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to
go to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,
should spend a Sunday at the Land's End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for
two mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a
sunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand
lonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best
to finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what
we had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to
creep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective
applicable to the Land's End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh
wind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt
than any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one's nerves
were strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do
anything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came
forward--a regular man-of-war's-man he looked--we at once resolved to
adventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was
accustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I'll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but
you--" eying me over with his keen sailor's glance, full of honesty and
good humour, "you're pretty well on in years, ma'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal
yet."Oh, I've taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was
nearly seventy.So we'll do our best, ma'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold
by, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he
guided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that
is, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done
for," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of
waters below.[Illustration: THE LAND'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the
exploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have
been bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one
grand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at
the farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that
magnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of
Lyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and
one, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to
him, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a
scene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of
St.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly
to walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long
rambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under
his arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an
excellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from
the north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little
lady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;
and the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both
as a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this
eternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We
bade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,
cautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of
our guide."Yes, ladies, that's the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General
Armstrong's horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor
beast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious
thing.I wouldn't have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw
it with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below
there--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of
boiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen
swimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a
curiosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and
the captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held
on there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;
the wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She
was pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst
not tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at
Whitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember
it well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But
when he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,
'She saved my life, she saved my life,' till he was taken away by his
friends.Look out, ma'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped
and broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the
hotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who
proceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,
but had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty's ship
_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma'am.I was in her off
Balaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once
so familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to
be almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I
came home invalided, and didn't attempt the service afterwards; but I
never thought I should come home at all.Yes, it's a fine place the
Land's End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right
off.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I'm not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten
face--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a
fine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we
gave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted
on our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone
weighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,
but ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack
and unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and
I keep it still in remembrance of the Land's End, and of the honest
sailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land's End no more.It
became now a real place, of which the reality, though different from
the imagination, was at least no disappointment.How few people in
attaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out
our original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled
days they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have
been glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the
carriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story
a friend had once told how, staying at Land's End, she crossed the bay
alone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where
she was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care
by a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey's end that he
had left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the
bay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village
had become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,
which was fast melting into night."We'll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a
comfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could
from the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers' burial
ground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the
Nine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting
things, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the
rising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might
be, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the
worry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We
have done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH


Monday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing
that by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if
we wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next
morning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which
involved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable
carriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn't be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from
his ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,
master will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like
to-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,
then he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock
to get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though
rather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning
moon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,
but decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,
Lamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on
no account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with
scientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen
a single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of
that magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the
day.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,
and I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to
Whitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it
in delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a
rest for the next day's fatigue.there
would be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in
a basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was
reported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but
some of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper
air.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no
time" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a
second view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we
made various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never
had the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that
we could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone
through England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always
seemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient
church and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me
some ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark
"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,
released for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,
weighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling
to their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of
the "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the
village with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not
help thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for
a large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the
carriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,
gradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was
almost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking
yourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a
paradise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about
like sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,
shallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed
before reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious
one, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we
quite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such
a splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,
and the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary
figure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless
a human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal
wisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,
the sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could
not last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched
ourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every
arm's-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I
seen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very
minute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The
collecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical
interests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King
Stephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have
landed here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over
by Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite
greatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the
exceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,
who can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a
glow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in
creation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for
dreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur
of the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and
breaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed
impossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his
wife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all
his other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the
Land's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful
we felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased
to have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the
Armed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make
out which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some
fragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a
little group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable
farewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled
or thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it
was another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small
boy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only
unemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent
air for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask
him to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But
he accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most
graphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,
making a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with
two moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own
accord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a
group of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me
how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what
hard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she
liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at
Sennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I
had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in
time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus
belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser
people can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the
strong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and
put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore
sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent
reason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I
conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as
their fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to
Penzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for
the swarm at the Land's End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence
here must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are
happy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an
equally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was
quite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of
Marazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign
princess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an
interest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,
with the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,
a year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von
Pawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval
knight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael's
Mount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half
the town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured
every available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,
the two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which
were supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest
curiosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the
St.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the
Land's End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in
a grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see
anything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,
no doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long
sometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and
down Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or
even a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,
so we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in
the lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging
for to-morrow's flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady
as to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter
might drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this
one little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during
all the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not
living--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And
finally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite
mournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I'll
wait till the moons up, and that'll help us.We'll get into Falmouth
by daylight.I've got to do the same thing often enough through the
summer, so I don't mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a
hasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,
not meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date
of writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly
till 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight
of a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,
and went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH


Into King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,
where he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one
may believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going
to-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have
long been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,
choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,
like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,
may see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,
may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would
call "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far
forward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:
  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.I recovered myself with the
assistance of a No'the'n gentleman--a Mr."Then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall?"The colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips, and set it
down."You say you were unconscious," returned the editor lightly, "and some
of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to
be the cause.They are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of
some foul play."Do you take me for a chuckle-headed niggah, that I
don't know when I'm thrown from a buck-jumping mustang?or do they think
I'm a Chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies?Do
they know, sir, that the account I have given I am responsible for,
sir?--personally responsible?"There was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious,
and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a
secret.A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in
defense."They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly
disposed person during your unconsciousness," explained the editor
diplomatically; "but as you say THAT was only for a moment, and that you
were aware of everything that happened"--He paused.As plain as I see this julep before me.I
had just left the Ramierez rancho.The senora,--a devilish pretty
woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me
her daughter's mustang if I could ride it home."I'm an older man than you, sir, but a
challenge from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet
old enough to decline.Gad, sir, I mounted the brute.I've ridden Morgan
stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback, sir, but I've never thrown
my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before.After he bolted I
held my own fairly, but he buck-jumped before I could lock my spurs
under him, and the second jump landed me!""How far from the Ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown?""A matter of four or five hundred yards, sir.""Then your accident might have been seen from the fonda?"For in that case, I may say, without vanity,
that--er--the--er senora would have come to my assistance."The old-fashioned shirt-frill which the colonel habitually wore grew
erectile with a swelling indignation, possibly half assumed to conceal a
certain conscious satisfaction beneath.Grey," he said, with pained
severity, "as a personal friend of mine, and a representative of the
press,--a power which I respect,--I overlook a disparaging reflection
upon a lady, which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and
thoughtlessness.At the same time, sir," he added, with illogical
sequence, "if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions, he knew where
I could be found, sir, and that it was not my habit to decline
giving gentlemen--of any nationality--satisfaction--sir!--personal
satisfaction."He paused, and then added, with a singular blending of anxiety and a
certain natural dignity, "I trust, sir, that nothing of this--er--kind
will appear in your paper.""It was to keep it out by learning the truth from you, my dear colonel,"
said the editor lightly, "that I called to-day.Why, it was even
suggested," he added, with a laugh, "that you were half strangled by a
lasso."To his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh, but brought his
hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed
face."I admit, sir," he said, with a forced smile, "that I experienced
a certain sensation of choking, and I may have mentioned it to Mr.Parmlee; but it was due, I believe, sir, to my cravat, which I always
wear loosely, as you perceive, becoming twisted in my fall, and in
rolling over."He extended his fat white hand to the editor, who shook it cordially,
and then withdrew.Nevertheless, although perfectly satisfied with his
mission, and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the
subject, Mr.What were the
relations of the colonel with the Ramierez family?From what he himself
had said, the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack
might have been possible, and the assault itself committed while the
colonel was unconscious.Grey, however, kept this to himself, briefly told his foreman that
he found no reason to add to the account already in type, and dismissed
the subject from his mind.One morning a week afterward, the foreman entered the sanctum
cautiously, and, closing the door of the composing-room behind him,
stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of
irresolution, shamefacedness, and humorous discomfiture in his face.Answering the editor's look of inquiry, he began slowly, "Mebbe ye
remember when we was talkin' last week o' Colonel Starbottle's accident,
I sorter allowed that he knew all the time WHY he was attacked that way,
only he wouldn't tell.""Yes, I remember you were incredulous," said the editor, smiling."Well, I have been through the mill myself!"He unbuttoned his shirt collar, pointed to his neck, which showed a
slight abrasion and a small livid mark of strangulation at the throat,
and added, with a grim smile, "And I've got about as much proof as I
want."The editor put down his pen and stared at him.When you bedeviled me
about gettin' that news, and allowed I might try my hand at reportin',
I was fool enough to take up the challenge.So once or twice, when I was
off duty here, I hung around the Ramierez shanty.Once I went in thar
when they were gamblin'; thar war one or two Americans thar that war
winnin' as far as I could see, and was pretty full o' that aguardiente
that they sell thar--that kills at forty rods.You see, I had a kind o'
suspicion that ef thar was any foul play goin' on it might be worked
on these fellers ARTER they were drunk, and war goin' home with thar
winnin's.""So you gave up your theory of the colonel being attacked from
jealousy?"I only reckoned that ef thar was a gang
of roughs kept thar on the premises they might be used for that purpose,
and I only wanted to ketch em at thar work.So I jest meandered into the
road when they war about comin' out, and kept my eye skinned for what
might happen.Thar was a kind o' corral about a hundred yards down the
road, half adobe wall, and a stockade o' palm's on top of it, about six
feet high.Some of the palm's were off, and I peeped through, but thar
warn't nobody thar.I stood thar, alongside the bank, leanin' my back
agin one o' them openin's, and jest watched and waited."All of a suddent I felt myself grabbed by my coat collar behind, and my
neck-handkercher and collar drawn tight around my throat till I couldn't
breathe.The more I twisted round, the tighter the clinch seemed to get.I couldn't holler nor speak, but thar I stood with my mouth open, pinned
back agin that cursed stockade, and my arms and legs movin' up and down,
like one o' them dancin' jacks!Grey--I reckon I
looked like a darned fool--but I don't wanter feel ag'in as I did jest
then.The clinch o' my throat got tighter; everything got black about
me; I was jest goin' off and kalkilatin' it was about time for you to
advertise for another foreman, when suthin broke--fetched away!"It was my collar button, and I dropped like a shot.It was a minute
before I could get my breath ag'in, and when I did and managed to climb
that darned stockade, and drop on the other side, thar warn't a soul to
be seen!A few hosses that stampeded in my gettin' over the fence war
all that was there!I was mighty shook up, you bet!--and to make the
hull thing perfectly ridic'lous, when I got back to the road, after all
I'd got through, darn my skin, ef thar warn't that pesky lot o' drunken
men staggerin' along, jinglin' the scads they had won, and enjoyin'
themselves, and nobody a-followin' 'em!I jined 'em jest for kempany's
sake, till we got back to town, but nothin' happened.""But, my dear Richards," said the editor warmly, "this is no longer a
matter of mere reporting, but of business for the police.You must see
the deputy sheriff at once, and bring your complaint--or shall I?"I've told this to nobody
but you--nor am I goin' to--sabe?It's an affair of my own--and I reckon
I kin take care of it without goin' to the Revised Statutes of the State
of California, or callin' out the sheriff's posse."His humorous blue eyes just then had certain steely points in them like
glittering facets as he turned them away, which the editor had
seen before on momentous occasions, and he was speaking slowly and
composedly, which the editor also knew boded no good to an adversary."Don't be a fool, Richards," he said quietly."Don't take as a personal
affront what was a common, vulgar crime.You would undoubtedly have been
robbed by that rascal had not the others come along.""I might hev bin robbed a dozen times afore
THEY came along--ef that was the little game.Grey,--it warn't
no robbery.""Had you been paying court to the Senora Ramierez, like Colonel
Starbottle?""Not much," returned Richards scornfully; "she ain't my style.But"--he
hesitated, and then added, "thar was a mighty purty gal thar--and her
darter, I reckon--a reg'lar pink fairy!She kem in only a minute, and
they sorter hustled her out ag'in--for darn my skin ef she didn't look
as much out o' place in that smoky old garlic-smellin' room as an angel
at a bull-fight.And what got me--she was ez white ez you or me, with
blue eyes, and a lot o' dark reddish hair in a long braid down her back.Why, only for her purty sing-song voice and her 'Gracias, senor,'
you'd hev reckoned she was a Blue Grass girl jest fresh from across the
plains."A little amused at his foreman's enthusiasm, Mr.Grey gave an
ostentatious whistle and said, "Come, now, Richards, look here!"Only a little girl--a mere child, Mr.Grey--not more'n fourteen if a
day," responded Richards, in embarrassed depreciation."Yes, but those people marry at twelve," said the editor, with a
laugh.Your appreciation may have been noticed by some other
admirer."He half regretted this speech the next moment in the quick flush--the
male instinct of rivalry--that brought back the glitter of Richards's
eyes."I reckon I kin take care of that, sir," he said slowly, "and I
kalkilate that the next time I meet that chap--whoever he may be--he
won't see so much of my back as he did."The editor knew there was little doubt of this, and for an instant
believed it his duty to put the matter in the hands of the police.Richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a bar-room fight.But reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to
avoid, he concluded to make some personal investigation.A stronger
curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him.It was singular,
too, that Richards's description of the girl was that of a different and
superior type--the hidalgo, or fair-skinned Spanish settler.If this
was true, what was she doing there--and what were her relations to the
Ramierez?PART II

The next afternoon he went to the fonda.Situated on the outskirts of
the town which had long outgrown it, it still bore traces of its former
importance as a hacienda, or smaller farm, of one of the old Spanish
landholders.The patio, or central courtyard, still existed as a
stable-yard for carts, and even one or two horses were tethered to the
railings of the inner corridor, which now served as an open veranda to
the fonda or inn.The opposite wing was utilized as a tienda, or
general shop,--a magazine for such goods as were used by the Mexican
inhabitants,--and belonged also to Ramierez.Ramierez himself--round-whiskered and Sancho Panza-like in
build--welcomed the editor with fat, perfunctory urbanity.The fonda and
all it contained was at his disposicion.The senora coquettishly bewailed, in rising and falling inflections, his
long absence, his infidelity and general perfidiousness.Truly he was
growing great in writing of the affairs of his nation--he could no
longer see his humble friends!Yet not long ago--truly that very
week--there was the head impresor of Don Pancho's imprenta himself who
had been there!A great man, of a certainty, and they must take what they could get!They were only poor innkeepers; when the governor came not they must
welcome the alcalde.To which the editor--otherwise Don Pancho--replied
with equal effusion.He had indeed recommended the fonda to his
impresor, who was but a courier before him.The
impresor had been ravished at the sight of a beautiful girl--a mere
muchacha--yet of a beauty that deprived the senses--this angel--clearly
the daughter of his friend!Here was the old miracle of the orange in
full fruition and the lovely fragrant blossom all on the same tree--at
the fonda."Yes, it was but a thing of yesterday," said the senora, obviously
pleased."The muchacha--for she was but that--had just returned from the
convent at San Jose, where she had been for four years.The fonda was no place for the child, who should know only the
litany of the Virgin--and they had kept her there.And now--that she
was home again--she cared only for the horse.There might be a festival--all the same to
her, it made nothing if she had the horse to ride!Even now she was with
one in the fields.Would Don Pancho attend and see Cota and her horse?"The editor smilingly assented, and accompanied his hostess along the
corridor to a few steps which brought them to the level of the open
meadows of the old farm inclosure.A slight white figure on horseback
was careering in the distance.At a signal from Senora Ramierez it
wheeled and came down rapidly towards them.But when within a hundred
yards the horse was suddenly pulled up vaquero fashion, and the little
figure leaped off and advanced toward them on foot, leading the horse.Grey saw that she had been riding bareback, and
from her discreet halt at that distance he half suspected ASTRIDE!His
effusive compliments to the mother on this exhibition of skill were
sincere, for he was struck by the girl's fearlessness.But when
both horse and rider at last stood before him, he was speechless and
embarrassed.For Richards had not exaggerated the girl's charms.She was indeed
dangerously pretty, from her tawny little head to her small feet,
and her figure, although comparatively diminutive, was perfectly
proportioned.Gray eyed and blonde as she was in color, her racial
peculiarities were distinct, and only the good-humored and enthusiastic
Richards could have likened her to an American girl.But he was the more astonished in noticing that her mustang was as
distinct and peculiar as herself--a mongrel mare of the extraordinary
type known as a "pinto," or "calico" horse, mottled in lavender and
pink, Arabian in proportions, and half broken!Her greenish gray eyes,
in which too much of the white was visible, had, he fancied, a singular
similarity of expression to Cota's own!Utterly confounded, and staring at the girl in her white, many flounced
frock, bare head, and tawny braids, as she stood beside this incarnation
of equine barbarism, Grey could remember nothing like it outside of a
circus.He stammered a few words of admiration of the mare.Miss Cota threw out
her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey, and said--

"A la disposicion de le Usted, senor."Grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this
formal curtsey and danced in the girl's eyes, and even fancied it shared
by the animal itself.But he was a singularly good rider of untrained
stock, and rather proud of his prowess."I accept that I may have the honor of laying the senorita's gift again
at her little feet."But here the burly Ramierez intervened.May the
devil fly away with all this nonsense!I will have no more of it," he
said impatiently to the girl."Have a care, Don Pancho," he turned to
the editor; "it is a trick!""One I think I know," said Grey sapiently.The girl looked at him
curiously as he managed to edge between her and the mustang, under the
pretense of stroking its glossy neck."I shall keep MY OWN spurs,"
he said to her in a lower voice, pointing to the sharp, small-roweled
American spurs he wore, instead of the large, blunt, five-pointed star
of the Mexican pattern.The girl evidently did not understand him then--though she did a moment
later!For without attempting to catch hold of the mustang's mane, Grey
in a single leap threw himself across its back.The animal, utterly
unprepared, was at first stupefied.But by this time her rider had his
seat.He felt her sensitive spine arch like a cat's beneath him as she
sprang rocket-wise into the air.Instead of clinging tightly to her flanks
with the inner side of his calves, after the old vaquero fashion to
which she was accustomed, he dropped his spurred heels into her sides
and allowed his body to rise with her spring, and the cruel spur to cut
its track upward from her belly almost to her back.She dropped like a shot, he dexterously withdrawing his spurs, and
regaining his seat, jarred but not discomfited.Again she essayed a
leap; the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her
smooth barrel.She tried a third leap, but this time dropped halfway as
she felt the steel scraping her side, and then stood still, trembling.There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife, assisted
by a lounging vaquero in the corridor.Ashamed of his victory, Grey
turned apologetically to Cota.To his surprise she glanced indifferently
at the trickling sides of her favorite, and only regarded him curiously."Ah," she said, drawing in her breath, "you are strong--and you
comprehend!""It was only a trick for a trick, senorita," he replied, reddening;
"let me look after those scratches in the stable," he added, as she was
turning away, leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in
the rear.He would have taken the riata which she was still holding, but she
motioned him to precede her.He did so by a few feet, but he had
scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly
by the shoulders, and, shoving him into the entrance, slammed the door
upon him.Amazed and a little indignant, he turned in time to hear a slight sound
of scuffling outside, and to see Cota re-enter with a flushed face."Pardon, senor," she said quickly, "but I feared she might have kicked
you.Rest tranquil, however, for the servant he has taken her away."She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily
driving the mustang toward the corral.I almost threw you, too;
but," she added, with a dazzling smile, "you must not punish me as you
have her!For you are very strong--and you comprehend."But Grey did not comprehend, and with a few hurried apologies he managed
to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor.Besides, this unlooked-for
incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his
visit,--the discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel
Starbottle.His inquiries of the Ramierez produced no result.Senor Ramierez was not
aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda,
and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free
of disturbance.the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was
dangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even
of Cota!Grey was fain to ride home empty of information.He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly
one afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the
composing-room.She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to
view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would
not be likely to "disturb Mr.But the beaming face of
Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed
the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted
splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for
the occasion.Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt.Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish
curiosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press,
or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his
"composing-stick."He had even printed a card with her name, "Senorita
Cota Ramierez," the type of which had been set up, to the accompaniment
of ripples of musical laughter, by her little brown fingers.The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not
noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly
on himself, even while apparently listening to Richards, were more than
ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had
wandered so coldly.He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foreman's innocent
tete-a-tete, but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the
highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop, and blew him an audacious
kiss from the tips of her fingers.For several days afterwards Richards's manner was tinged with a certain
reserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the
delicacy of a serious affection, but he was surprised also to find that
his foreman's eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat
abated.Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped, and the
editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened
by a chance incident.An intimate friend and old companion of his--one Enriquez Saltillo--had
diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him.Enriquez
was a scion of one of the oldest Spanish-California families, and in
addition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect
an intense admiration of American ways and habits, and even to combine
the current California slang with his native precision of speech--and a
certain ironical levity still more his own.It seemed, therefore, quite natural to Mr.Grey to find him seated with
his feet on the editorial desk, his hat cocked on the back of his head,
reading the "Clarion" exchanges.But he was up in a moment, and had
embraced Grey with characteristic effusion."I find myself, my leetle brother, but an hour ago two leagues from this
spot!It is the home of Don Pancho--my friend!I shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader, collecting
the subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry, or gouging
out the eye of the rival editor, at which I shall assist!'I hesitate no
longer; I fly on the instant, and I am here."Saltillo knew the Spanish population thoroughly--his
own superior race and their Mexican and Indian allies.If any one could
solve the mystery of the Ramierez fonda, and discover Richards's unknown
assailant, it was HE!But Grey contented himself, at first, with a
few brief inquiries concerning the beautiful Cota and her anonymous
association with the Ramierez."Of your suspicions, my leetle brother, you are right--on the half!That
leetle angel of a Cota is, without doubt, the daughter of the adorable
Senora Ramierez, but not of the admirable senor--her husband.We are a simple, patriarchal race; thees Ramierez, he was the
Mexican tenant of the old Spanish landlord--such as my father--and we
are ever the fathers of the poor, and sometimes of their children.It
is possible, therefore, that the exquisite Cota resemble the Spanish
landlord.I remember," he went on, suddenly
striking his forehead with a dramatic gesture, "the old owner of thees
ranch was my cousin Tiburcio.Of a consequence, my friend, thees angel
is my second cousin!I shall
embrace my long-lost relation.I shall introduce my best friend, Don
Pancho, who lofe her.I shall say, 'Bless you, my children,' and it is
feenish!He started up and clapped on his hat, but Grey caught him by the arm."For Heaven's sake, Enriquez, be serious for once," he said, forcing him
back into the chair.The foreman in the other
room is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl.In fact, it is on his
account that I am making these inquiries.""Ah, the gentleman of the pantuflos, whose trousers will not remain!Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive
from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash.But," in
recognition of Grey's half serious impatience, "remain tranquil.The friend of my friend is ever the
same as my friend!He is truly not seducing to the eye, but without
doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time.I shall gif
to him my second cousin.He attempted to rise, but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey."I've half a mind to let you do it, and get chucked through the window
for your pains," said the editor, with a half laugh.This
is a more serious matter than you suppose."And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on
Starbottle and Richards.As he proceeded he noticed, however, that
the ironical light died out of Enriquez's eyes, and a singular
thoughtfulness, yet unlike his usual precise gravity, came over his
face.He twirled the ends of his penciled mustache--an unfailing sign of
Enriquez's emotion."The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as
the gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that
it come from Ramierez, though they both were at the fonda," he said
gravely."The cause of it have not come to-day, nor yesterday, nor
last week.The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant
Starbottle or excellent Richards; before there was any American in
California--before you and I, my leetle brother, have lif!The cause
happen first--TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!"The editor's start of impatient incredulity was checked by the
unmistakable sincerity of Enriquez's face."It is so," he went on
gravely; "it is an old story--it is a long story.I shall make him
short--and new."He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression."It was when the padres first have the mission, and take the heathen and
convert him--and save his soul.It was their business, you comprehend,
my Pancho?The more heathen they convert, the more soul they save, the
better business for their mission shop.But the heathen do not always
wish to be 'convert;' the heathen fly, the heathen skidaddle, the
heathen will not remain, or will backslide.So the
holy fathers make a little game.You do not of a possibility comprehend
how the holy fathers make a convert, my leetle brother?"They take from the presidio five or six
dragons--you comprehend--the cavalry soldiers, and they pursue the
heathen from his little hut.When they cannot surround him and he fly,
they catch him with the lasso, like the wild hoss.The lasso catch
him around the neck; he is obliged to remain.Sometime he is dead, but the soul is save!I
see you wrinkle the brow--you flash the eye; you like it not?Believe
me, I like it not, neither, but it is so!"He shrugged his shoulders, threw away his half smoked cigarette, and
went on."One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul,
when he find the heathen, who is a young girl, have escape the soldiers,
he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it!He is lucky; he catch
her--but look you!She not only fly, but of
a surety she drag the good padre with her!He cannot loose himself, for
his riata is fast to the saddle; the dragons cannot help, for he is drag
so fast.On the instant she have gone--and so have the padre.It is not a young girl he have lasso, but the devil!You comprehend--it
is a punishment--a retribution--he is feenish!"For every year he must come back a spirit--on a spirit hoss--and swing
the lasso, and make as if to catch the heathen.He is condemn ever to
play his little game; now there is no heathen more to convert, he catch
what he can.My grandfather have once seen him--it is night and a storm,
and he pass by like a flash!My grandfather like it not--he is much
dissatisfied!My uncle have seen him, too, but he make the sign of
the cross, and the lasso have fall to the side, and my uncle have much
gratification.A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both
been picked up, lassoed, and dragged dead."Many peoples have died of him in the strangling.Sometime he is seen,
sometime it is the woman only that one sees--sometime it is but the
hoss.Of a truth, my friend, the
gallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped!"There was not the slightest
suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner; nothing, indeed,
but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament.It struck
him also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang
which was always a part of his imitative levity."Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known?"It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story."With it he seemed to have put on his old
levity."Come, behold, it is a long time between drinks!Let us to the
hotel and the barkeep, who shall give up the smash of brandy and the
julep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the
swallow!Grey returned to the "Clarion" office in a much more satisfied
condition of mind.Whatever faith he held in Enriquez's sincerity, for
the first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had
found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident.The
legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital
"copy."No names would be mentioned, yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized
his own adventure, he could not possibly object to this interpretation
of it.The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of
a ghost story, or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation.Nor
could Richards find fault with this view of his own experience, hitherto
kept a secret, so long as it did not refer to his relations with the
fair Cota.Summoning him at once to his sanctum, he briefly repeated the
story he had just heard, and his purpose of using it.To his surprise,
Richards's face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquez's
own.Grey," he said awkwardly, "and I ain't sayin'
it ain't mighty good newspaper stuff, but it won't do NOW, for the whole
mystery's up and the assailant found.""I didn't reckon ye were so keen on it," said Richards embarrassedly,
"and--and--it wasn't my own secret altogether.""Go on," said the editor impatiently."Well," said Richards slowly and doggedly, "ye see there was a fool that
was sweet on Cota, and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride
her cursed pink and yaller mustang.Naturally the beast bolted at once,
but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so, when it
took to buck-jumpin'.The first 'buck' threw him clean into the road,
but didn't stun him, yet when he tried to rise, the first thing he
knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody.He was
held so tight that he couldn't turn, but he managed to get out his
revolver and fire two shots under his arm.The grip held on for a
minute, and then loosened, and the somethin' slumped down on top o' him,
but he managed to work himself around.And then--what do you think he
saw?--why, that thar hoss!with two bullet holes in his neck, lyin'
beside him, but still grippin' his coat collar and neck-handkercher in
his teeth!the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle, the
villain that took me behind when I was leanin' agin that cursed fence,
was that same God-forsaken, hell-invented pinto hoss!"In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience, and
the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda.Undoubtedly
Cota had saved him from a similar attack."But why not tell this story with the other?"said the editor, returning
to his first idea."It won't do," said Richards, with dogged resolution."Yes," said Richards, with a darkening face."Again attacked, and by the
same hoss!Whether Cota was or was not knowin' its tricks,
she was actually furious at me for killin' it--and it's all over 'twixt
me and her.""Nonsense," said the editor impulsively; "she will forgive you!You
didn't know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED.Look at the
attack on you in the road!"Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness.I oughter guessed it was a hoss then--thar was nothin' else in
that corral.Cota's already gone away back to San Jose, and I reckon
the Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off.So, on account
of its bein' HER hoss, and what happened betwixt me and her, you see my
mouth is shut.""And the columns of the 'Clarion' too," said the editor, with a sigh."I know it's hard, sir, but it's better so.I've reckoned mebbe she was
a little crazy, and since you've told me that Spanish yarn, it mout
be that she was sort o' playin' she was that priest, and trained that
mustang ez she did."After a pause, something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as
he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders."Yes, sir, I was a fool, for we've lost the only bit of real sensation
news that ever came in the way of the 'Clarion.'"A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS


It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and the hottest hour of the day
on that Sierran foothill.The western sun, streaming down the mile-long
<DW72> of close-set pine crests, had been caught on an outlying ledge of
glaring white quartz, covered with mining tools and debris, and
seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage.The air above it
shimmered and became visible.A white canvas tent on it was an object
not to be borne; the steel-tipped picks and shovels, intolerable to
touch and eyesight, and a tilted tin prospecting pan, falling over,
flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence.At such moments
the five members of the "Eureka Mining Company" prudently withdrew to
the nearest pine-tree, which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the
glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that
line cut like a knife.The men lay, or squatted, in this shadow,
feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond
the burning ledge.Yet so irritating was the dry air, fragrant with the
aroma of the heated pines, that occasionally one would start up and walk
about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave
a momentary relief, and, as he believed, saved him from sunstroke.Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously:--

"Derned if the blasted bucket ain't empty ag'in!Not a drop left, by
Jimminy!"A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted
heads; then every man lay down again, as if trying to erase himself."I did," said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably
on his back, "and if anybody reckons I'm going to face Tophet ag'in
down that <DW72>, he's mistaken!"The speaker was thirsty--but he had
principles."We must throw round for it," said the foreman, taking the dice from his
pocket.He cast; the lowest number fell to Parkhurst, a florid, full-blooded
Texan."All right, gentlemen," he said, wiping his forehead, and lifting
the tin pail with a resigned air, "only EF anything comes to me on that
bare stretch o' stage road,--and I'm kinder seein' things spotty and
black now, remember you ain't anywhar NEARER the water than you were!I
ain't sayin' it for myself--but it mout be rough on YOU--and"--

"Give ME the pail," interrupted a tall young fellow, rising.Cries of "Good old Ned," and "Hunky boy!"greeted him as he took the
pail from the perspiring Parkhurst, who at once lay down again."You
mayn't be a professin' Christian, in good standin', Ned Bray," continued
Parkhurst from the ground, "but you're about as white as they make 'em,
and you're goin' to do a Heavenly Act!I repeat it, gents--a Heavenly
Act!"Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail, stopping only in the
underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put
within the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around
the outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders.Thus
equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail
which began to descend towards the stage road.Here he was in the
full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which
scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash.The descent was
steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine
needles that had fallen from above.Nor were his troubles over when,
a few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in
a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by
heavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so
heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the
foot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it.Yet there were
two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach
that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped
diagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he
was seeking.When he reached the trail, he paused to take breath and wipe the
blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung
himself over the bank into it.A single misstep here would have sent him
headlong to the tops of pine-trees a thousand feet below.Holding his
pail in one hand, with the other he steadied himself by clutching the
ferns and brambles at his side, and at last reached the spring--a niche
in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide.He had merely
accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the
Eureka Company four or five times a day!He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear,
cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin; he threw the water over
his head and shoulders; he swung his legs over the ledge and let the
overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles.Gentle and delicious rigors
came over him.He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark
olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain.A hawk
was swinging lazily above it, apparently within a stone's throw of him;
he knew it was at least a mile away.Thirty feet above him ran the stage
road; he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs, the dull
jar of harness, and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it
crawled up the long ascent, part of which he had just passed.He thought
of it,--a slow drifting cloud of dust and heat, as he had often seen
it, abandoned by even its passengers, who sought shelter in the wayside
pines as they toiled behind it to the summit,--and hugged himself in
the grateful shadows of the spring.It had passed out of hearing and
thought, he had turned to fill his pail, when he was startled by a
shower of dust and gravel from the road above, and the next moment he
was thrown violently down, blinded and pinned against the ledge by the
fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders.His last flash of
consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped
from the pack of some passing mule.It was probably
not long, for his chilled hands and arms, thrust by the blow on his
shoulders into the pool of water, assisted in restoring him.He came
to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back, but his head and
shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft
fabrics and draperies, which, to his connecting consciousness, seemed as
if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack.With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the
pool, and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings.In
doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesh--a soft, bared arm!With
the same astounding discovery came one more terrible: that arm belonged
to the weight that was pressing him down; and now, assisted by his
struggles, it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the
abyss below!With a desperate effort he turned on his side, caught the
body,--as such it was,--dragged it back on the ledge, at the same
moment that, freeing his head from its covering,--a feminine skirt,--he
discovered it was a woman!She had been also unconscious, although the touch of his cold, wet hand
on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself
in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes.Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward
her, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt,
and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned.She was a tall,
handsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in
her torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were
split into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown
beneath."What--is it?--what has happened?"she said faintly, yet with a slight
touch of formality in her manner."You must have fallen--from the road above," said Bray hesitatingly.she repeated, with a slight frown, as if to
concentrate her thought.She glanced upward, then at the ledge before
her, and then, for the first time, at the darkening abyss below.The
color, which had begun to return, suddenly left her face here, and
she drew instinctively back against the mountain side."Yes," she half
murmured to herself, rather than to him, "it must be so.I was walking
too near the bank--and--I fell!"Then turning to him, she said, "And you
found me lying here when you came.""I think," stammered Bray, "that I was here when you fell, and I--I
broke the fall."She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him, saw the dust, dirt, and leaves
on his back and shoulders, the collar of his shirt torn open, and a
few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead.Her black eyebrows
straightened again as she said coldly, "Dear me!I am very sorry; I
couldn't help it, you know."But you, are you sure you are not injured?"I'm not hurt," she said, helping herself to her feet by the aid of the
mountain-side bushes, and ignoring his proffered hand."But," she
added quickly and impressively, glancing upward toward the stage road
overhead, "why don't they come?I must have
been here a long time; it's too bad!""Yes," she said impatiently, "of course!I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under
the trees.My foot must have slipped up
there--and--I--slid--down.Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness.But on turning around in her
impatience, she caught sight of the chasm again, and lapsed quite white
against the mountain side."Let me give you some water from the spring," he said eagerly, as she
sank again to a sitting posture; "it will refresh you."He looked hesitatingly around him; he had neither cup nor flask, but he
filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips.She drank
a little, extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket, dipped
its point in the water, and wiped her face delicately, after a certain
feline fashion.Then, catching sight of some small object in the fork of
a bush above her, she quickly pounced upon it, and with a swift sweep
of her hand under her skirt, put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER, and stood on her
feet again."How does one get out of such a place?"she asked fretfully, and then,
glancing at him half indignantly, "why don't you shout?""I was going to tell you," he said gently, "that when you are a little
stronger, we can get out by the way I came in,--along the trail."He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline.Somehow,
with this tall, beautiful creature beside him, it looked more perilous
than before.She may have thought so too, for she drew in her breath
sharply and sank down again.she asked suddenly, opening her
gray eyes upon him.she went on, almost
impertinently.He stopped, and then it suddenly occurred
to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this
tall, good-looking girl, even if he HAD saved her.He gave a little
laugh, and added mischievously, "Just like Jack and Jill, you know."she said sharply, bending her black brows at him."Jack and Jill," he returned carelessly; "I broke my crown, you know,
and YOU,"--he did not finish.She stared at him, trying to keep her face and her composure; but a
smile, that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable, here
lifted the corners of her mouth, and she turned her face aside.But
the smile, and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed, were
unfortunately on the side toward him.Emboldened by this, he went on,
"I couldn't think what had happened.At first I had a sort of idea that
part of a mule's pack had fallen on top of me,--blankets, flour, and all
that sort of thing, you know, until"--

Her smile had vanished."Well," she said impatiently, "until?"I'm afraid I gave you a shock; my hand was
dripping from the spring."She  so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the
time, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been
half torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it.When and how
had she managed to do it without his detecting the act?"At all events," she said coldly, "I'm glad you have not received
greater injury from--your mule pack.""I think we've both been very lucky," he said simply.She did not reply, but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail."I thought I heard voices," she said, half rising.You say there's no use--there's only this way out of it!""I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he
suggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the
abyss.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There's a dreadful fascination in it even now.I think I'd rather
go--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may
be weaker."She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently
agitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,
ladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a
heightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved
from the ledge toward the trail."But it's only wide enough for ONE, and I never--NEVER--could even stand
on it a minute alone!""We will go together, side by side," he
said quietly, "but you will have to take the outside.""I shall keep hold of you," he explained; "you need not fear that.He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief
which he wore around his shoulders, knotted one end of it firmly to his
belt, and handed her the other."Do you think you can hold on to that?""I--don't know,"--she hesitated.He pointed to a girdle of yellow
leather which caught her tunic around her small waist."Yes," she said eagerly, "it's real leather."He gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it.They were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief."I feel much safer," she said, with a faint smile."But if I should fall," he remarked, looking into her eyes, "you would
go too!"It would be really Jack
and Jill this time.""Now I must take YOUR arm," he said
laughingly; "not you MINE."He passed his arm under hers, holding it
firmly.For the first few steps her
uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side, which seemed
to slip sideways beneath her.He was literally carrying her on his
shoulder.But in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself,
always leaning toward the hillside, and presently she was able to help
him by a few steps."It's nothing; I carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop."She stiffened slightly under this remark, and indeed so far overdid her
attempt to walk without his aid, that her foot slipped on a stone,
and she fell outward toward the abyss.But in an instant his arm was
transferred from her elbow to her waist, and in the momentum of his
quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side."I'm afraid you'd have spilt the pail that time," she said, with a
slightly heightened color, as she disengaged herself gently from his
arm."No," he answered boldly, "for the pail never would have stiffened
itself in a tiff, and tried to go alone.""Of course not, if it were only a pail," she responded.The trail was growing a little steeper
toward the upper end and the road bank.Bray was often himself obliged
to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them.Bray listened; he could hear at intervals a far-off shout; then a nearer
one--a name--"Eugenia."A sudden glow of
pleasure came over him--he knew not why, except that she did not look
delighted, excited, or even relieved."Only a few yards more," he said, with an unaffected half sigh."Then I'd better untie this," she suggested, beginning to fumble at the
knot of the handkerchief which linked them.Their heads were close together, their fingers often met; he would have
liked to say something, but he could only add: "Are you sure you will
feel quite safe?It is a little steeper as we near the bank.""You can hold me," she replied simply, with a superbly unconscious
lifting of her arm, as she yielded her waist to him again, but without
raising her eyes.He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the
remaining <DW72>, for it seemed to him as a last embrace.As he lifted
her to the road bank, the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw
two men and a woman running down the hill toward them.In that instant she had slipped the tattered dust-coat from her
shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly
awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to
shame their excitement.He noticed, too, with the quick perception of
unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that
she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was
wearing it on her breast."You have alarmed us beyond measure--kept the stage waiting, and now it
is gone!"said the younger man, with brotherly brusqueness.As these questions were all uttered in the same breath, Eugenia replied
to them collectively."It was so hot that I kept along the bank here,
while you were on the other side.I heard the trickle of water somewhere
down there, and searching for it my foot slipped.This gentleman"--she
indicated Bray--"was on a little sort of a trail there, and assisted me
back to the road again."The two men and the woman turned and stared at Bray with a look of
curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern.They
saw a youngish sort of man, with a long mustache, a two days' growth of
beard, a not overclean face, that was further streaked with red on the
temple, a torn flannel shirt, that showed a very white shoulder beside
a sunburnt throat and neck, and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy
high boots--in fact, the picture of a broken-down miner.But their
unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect
ease and equality with which he regarded them, a regard the more
exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some
satire or humor in the situation.I--er"--

"The lady has thanked me," interrupted Bray, with a smile.said the younger man to Eugenia, ignoring Bray."Not far," she answered, with a half appealing look at Bray."Only a few feet," added the latter, with prompt mendacity, "just a
little slip down."The three new-comers here turned away, and, surrounding Eugenia,
conversed in an undertone.Quite conscious that he was the subject of
discussion, Bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance
from Eugenia.The words "YOU do it," "No, YOU!""It would come better
from HER," were distinctly audible to him.To his surprise, however,
she suddenly broke through them, and advancing to him, with a dangerous
brightness in her beautiful eyes, held out her slim hand.Neworth, my brother, Harry Neworth, and my aunt, Mrs.Dobbs," she
said, indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome
head, "all think I ought to give you something and send you away.I
believe that is the way they put it.I come to
ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me
to-day--which I shall never forget."When he had returned her firm
handclasp for a minute, she coolly rejoined the discomfited group."She's no sardine," said Bray to himself emphatically, "but I suspect
she'll catch it from her folks for this.I ought to have gone away at
once, like a gentleman, hang it!"He was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow
her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed
up the hill with her, when he reflected that it would only make matters
worse.And with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had
not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades.He
had forgotten them for these lazy, snobbish, purse-proud San
Franciscans--for Bray had the miner's supreme contempt for the moneyed
trading classes.He flung himself over
the bank, and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring.But here
again he lingered--the place had become suddenly hallowed.He gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any
trace that she had left--a bow, a bit of ribbon, or even a hairpin that
had fallen from her.As the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own
reflection in the spring.It certainly was not that of an Adonis!He laughed honestly; his sense of humor had saved him from many an
extravagance, and mitigated many a disappointment before this.She
was a plucky, handsome girl--even if she was not for him, and he might
never set eyes on her again.Yet it was a hard pull up that trail once
more, carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once
sustained a lovely girl!He remembered her reply to his badinage,
"Of course not--if it were only a pail," and found a dozen pretty
interpretations of it.He was too poor and
too level headed for that!And he was unaffectedly and materially tired,
too, when he reached the road again, and rested, leaving the spring and
its little idyl behind.By this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the Eureka Company,
and the stage road was also in shadow, so that his return through its
heavy dust was less difficult.And when he at last reached the camp, he
found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by
his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment; for
it appeared that a well-known San Francisco capitalist, whom the
foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and
investment, had actually come over from Red Dog for that purpose, and
had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident, and
delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to Sacramento without
making his examination."That was only his excuse--mere flap-doodle!"interrupted the
pessimistic Jerrold."He was foolin' you; he'd heard of suthin better!The idea of calling that affair an 'accident,' or one that would stop
any man who meant business!""A d----d fool woman's accident," broke in the misogynist Parkhurst,
"and it's true!That's what makes it so cussed mean.For there's allus
a woman at the bottom of such things--bet your life!Think of 'em comin'
here.Thar ought to be a law agin it.""Why, what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him
his daughter and auntie to'see the wonderful scenery with popa
dear!'as if it was a cheap Sunday-school panorama!And what do these
chuckle-headed women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin'
about, and playin' 'here we go round the mulberry bush' until one of 'em
tumbles down a ravine.and 'dear popa'
was up and down the road yellin' 'Me cheyld!And then there
was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got, and the coach
goes off, and 'popa dear' gets left, and then has to hurry off in a
buggy to catch it.So WE get left too, just because that God-forsaken
fool, Neworth, brings his women here."Under this recital poor Bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair
daughter of Neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring.It was HIS delay and dalliance with her
that had checked Neworth's visit; worse than that, it was his subsequent
audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal
of the negotiations.He had shipwrecked his partners' prospects in his
absurd vanity and pride!He did not dare to raise his eyes to their
dejected faces.He would have confessed everything to them, but the
same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her
adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips.How might they not
misconstrue his conduct--and HERS!Perhaps something of this was visible
in his face."Come, old man," said the cheerful misogynist, with perfect innocence,
"don't take it so hard.Some time in a man's life a woman's sure to get
the drop on him, as I said afore, and this yer woman's got the drop on
five of us!But--hallo, Ned, old man--what's the matter with your head?"He laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner."I had--a slip--on the trail," he stammered."Had to go back again for
another pailful.That's what delayed me, you know, boys," he added.ejaculated Parkhurst, clapping him on the back and twisting
him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions.Look at him, gentlemen; and he says it's 'nothing.'That's how a MAN
takes it!HE didn't go round yellin' and wringin' his hands and sayin'
'Me pay-l!He just humped himself and trotted
back for another.And yet every drop of water in that overset bucket
meant hard work and hard sweat, and was as precious as gold."Luckily for Bray, whose mingled emotions under Parkhurst's eloquence
were beginning to be hysterical, the foreman interrupted.it's time we got to work again, and took another heave at
the old ledge!But now that this job of Neworth's is over--I don't mind
tellin' ye suthin."As their leader usually spoke but little, and to
the point, the four men gathered around him."Although I engineered this
affair, and got it up, somehow, I never SAW that Neworth standing on
this ledge!The look of superstition
which Bray and the others had often seen on this old miner's face,
and which so often showed itself in his acts, was there."And though I
wanted him to come, and allowed to have him come, I'm kinder relieved
that he didn't, and so let whatsoever luck's in the air come to us five
alone, boys, just as we stand."The next morning Bray was up before his companions, and although it was
not his turn, offered to bring water from the spring.He was not in love
with Eugenia--he had not forgotten his remorse of the previous day--but
he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her
image from his mind.And he had heard that although Neworth had gone on
to Sacramento, his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or
two at the ditch superintendent's house on the summit, only two miles
away.She might pass on the road; he might get a glimpse of her again
and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever, and he should
have to take up the daily routine of his work again.It was not love--of
THAT he was assured--but it was the way to stop it by convincing himself
of its madness.Besides, in view of all the circumstances, it was his
duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the
accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it.He found the
spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscurity,--a
mere niche in the mountain side that held only--water!The stage road
was deserted save for an early, curly-headed schoolboy, whom he found
lurking on the bank, but who evaded his company and conversation.He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy.His late zeal as a
water-carrier had earned him a day or two's exemption from that duty.His place was taken the next afternoon by the woman-hating Parkhurst,
and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same
afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento.The new water-bringer was
as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his
predecessor!His unfortunate
partners, toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge, were
clamorous from thirst, and Bray was becoming absurdly uneasy.It could
not be possible that Eugenia's accident had been repeated!The mystery
was presently cleared, however, by the abrupt appearance of Parkhurst
running towards them, but WITHOUT HIS PAIL!The cry of consternation and
despair which greeted that discovery was, however, quickly changed by
a single breathless, half intelligible sentence he had shot before him
from his panting lips.And he was holding something in his outstretched
palm that was more eloquent than words.In an instant they had him under the shade of the pine-tree, and were
squatting round him like schoolboys.His story, far from being brief, was incoherent and at times seemed
irrelevant, but that was characteristic.They would remember that he had
always held the theory that, even in quartz mining, the deposits were
always found near water, past or present, with signs of fluvial erosion!He didn't call himself one of your blanked scientific miners, but his
head was level!It was all very well for them to say "Yes, yes!"NOW,
but they didn't use to!when he got to the spring, he noticed
that there had been a kind of landslide above it, of course, from water
cleavage, and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side,
where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes!Excited as Bray was, he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track
made by Eugenia in her fall, which he himself had noticed."When I saw that," continued Parkhurst, more rapidly and coherently,
"I saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came
through--as if it had been the old channel of the spring.I widened it
a little with my clasp knife, and then--in a little pouch or pocket of
decomposed quartz--I found that!Not only that, boys," he continued,
rising, with a shout, "but the whole <DW72> above the spring is a mass of
seepage underneath, as if you'd played a hydraulic hose on it, and it's
ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz!"The men leaped to their feet; in another moment they had snatched picks,
pans, and shovels, and, the foreman leading, with a coil of rope thrown
over his shoulders, were all flying down the trail to the highway.The spring was not on THEIR claim; it was known to
others; it was doubtful if Parkhurst's discovery with his knife amounted
to actual WORK on the soil.They must "take it up" with a formal notice,
and get to work at once!In an hour they were scattered over the mountain side, like bees
clinging to the fragrant <DW72> of laurel and myrtle above the spring.An
excavation was made beside it, and the ledge broadened by a dozen
feet.Even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled
prospecting pans.And when the Pioneer Coach slowly toiled up the road
that afternoon, the passengers stared at the scarcely dry "Notice of
Location" pinned to the pine by the road bank, whence Eugenia had fallen
two days before!Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray worked with his companions, it was
with more conflicting feelings.There was a certain sense of desecration
in their act.How her proud lip would have curled had she seen him--he
who but a few hours before would have searched the whole <DW72> for
the treasure of a ribbon, a handkerchief, or a bow from her dress--now
delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so
mysteriously disclosed.Mysteriously he believed, for he had not fully
accepted Parkhurst's story.That gentle misogynist had never been an
active prospector; an inclination to theorize without practice and to
combat his partners' experience were all against his alleged process of
discovery, although the gold was actually there; and his conduct that
afternoon was certainly peculiar.He did but little of the real
work; but wandered from man to man, with suggestions, advice, and
exhortations, and the air of a superior patron.This might have been
characteristic, but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and
watchfulness.He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail,
staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance, and at times falling
into fits of strange abstraction.At other times he would draw near to
one of his fellow partners, as if for confidential disclosure, and then
check himself and wander aimlessly away.And it was not until evening
came that the mystery was solved.The prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined, the <DW72> above
and below had been fully explored and tested, with a result and promise
that outran their most sanguine hopes.There was no mistaking the fact
that they had made a "big" strike.That singular gravity and reticence,
so often observed in miners at these crises, had come over them as
they sat that night for the last time around their old camp-fire on
the Eureka ledge, when Parkhurst turned impulsively to Bray."Roll over
here," he said in a whisper."I want to tell ye suthin!"Bray "rolled" beyond the squatting circle, and the two men gradually
edged themselves out of hearing of the others.In the silent abstraction
that prevailed nobody noticed them."It's got suthin to do with this discovery," said Parkhurst, in a low,
mysterious tone, "but as far as the gold goes, and our equal rights to
it as partners, it don't affect them.If I," he continued in a slightly
patronizing, paternal tone, "choose to make you and the other boys
sharers in what seems to be a special Providence to ME, I reckon we
won't quarrel on it.It's one
of those things ye read about in books and don't take any stock in!But
we've got the gold--and I've got the black and white to prove it--even
if it ain't exactly human."His voice sank so low, his manner was so impressive, that despite his
known exaggeration, Bray felt a slight thrill of superstition.Meantime
Parkhurst wiped his brow, took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of
laurel from his pocket, and drew a long breath."When I got to the spring this afternoon," he went on, in a nervous,
tremulous, and scarcely audible voice, "I saw this bit o' paper, folded
note-wise, lyin' on the ledge before it.On top of it was this sprig
of laurel, to catch the eye.I ain't the man to pry into other folks'
secrets, or read what ain't mine.But on the back o' this note was
written 'To Jack!'It's a common enough name, but it's a singular thing,
ef you'll recollect, thar ain't ANOTHER Jack in this company, not on the
whole ridge betwixt this and the summit, except MYSELF!So I opened it,
and this is what it read!"He held the paper sideways toward the leaping
light of the still near camp-fire, and read slowly, with the emphasis of
having read it many times before."'I want you to believe that I, at least, respect and honor your honest,
manly calling, and when you strike it rich, as you surely will, I hope
you will sometimes think of Jill.'"In the thrill of joy, hope, and fear that came over Bray, he could see
that Parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret, but had not
even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion."But do you
know anybody named Jill?""It's no NAME," said Parkhurst in a sombre voice, "it's a THING!""Yes, a measure--you know--two fingers of whiskey.""Oh, a 'gill,'" said Bray."That's what I said, young man," returned Parkhurst gravely.Bray choked back a hysterical laugh; spelling was notoriously not one of
Parkhurst's strong points."But what has a 'gill' got to do with it?""It's one of them Sphinx things, don't you see?A sort of riddle or
rebus, you know.You've got to study it out, as them old chaps did."Pints, I suppose," said Bray."QUARTZ, and there you are.So I looked about me for quartz, and sure
enough struck it the first pop."Bray cast a quick look at Parkhurst's grave face.The man was evidently
impressed and sincere.or you'll spoil the charm, and bring us ill luck!I really don't know that you ought to have told
me," added the artful Bray, dissembling his intense joy at this proof of
Eugenia's remembrance."But," said Parkhurst blankly, "you see, old man, you'd been the last
man at the spring, and I kinder thought"--

"Don't think," said Bray promptly, "and above all, don't talk; not a
word to the boys of this.I've
got to go to San Francisco next week, and I'll take care of it and think
it out!"He knew that Parkhurst might be tempted to talk, but without
the paper his story would be treated lightly.Parkhurst handed him the
paper, and the two men returned to the camp-fire.The superstition of the lover is
no less keen than that of the gambler, and Bray, while laughing at
Parkhurst's extravagant fancy, I am afraid was equally inclined to
believe that their good fortune came through Eugenia's influence.At least he should tell her so, and her precious note became now an
invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her.The only fear that
possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of
her note before she left that afternoon; the only thing he could not
understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring,
for she could not have taken it herself.But this would doubtless be
explained by her in San Francisco, whither he intended to seek her.His
affairs, the purchasing of machinery for their new claim, would no doubt
give him easy access to her father.But it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and
fashionable outfit in San Francisco, and quite another to stand before
the "palatial" residence of the Neworths on Rincon Hill, with the
consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the Neworths'
discourtesy on the mountain, and, even in his fine feathers, Bray
hesitated.At this moment a carriage rolled up to the door, and Eugenia,
an adorable vision of laces and silks, alighted.Forgetting everything else, he advanced toward her with outstretched
hand.He saw her start, a faint color come into her face; he knew he
was recognized; but she stiffened quickly again, the color vanished, her
beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment, and then, with
the faintest inclination of her proud head, she swept by him and entered
the house.But Bray, though shocked, was not daunted, and perhaps his own pride was
awakened.He ran to his hotel, summoned a messenger, inclosed her note
in an envelope, and added these lines:--


DEAR MISS NEWORTH,--I only wanted to thank you an hour ago, as I should
like to have done before, for the kind note which I inclose, but which
you have made me feel I have no right to treasure any longer, and to
tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than
fulfilled.Yours, very gratefully,

EDMUND BRAY.Within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply:--

"Miss Neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good
fortune which prevented Mr.Bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her
foolish note."Cold as this response was, Bray's heart leaped.She HAD lingered on the
summit, and HAD expected a reply.He seized his hat, and, jumping into
the first cab at the hotel door, drove rapidly back to the house.He
had but one idea, to see her at any cost, but one concern, to avoid a
meeting with her father first, or a denial at her very door.He dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the
house.It had a large garden in the rear, reclaimed from the adjacent
"scrub oak" infested sand hill, and protected by a high wall.If he
could scale that wall, he could command the premises.It was a bright
morning; she might be tempted into the garden.A taller scrub oak grew
near the wall; to the mountain-bred Bray it was an easy matter to swing
himself from it to the wall, and he did.But his momentum was so great
that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden
to save himself from falling there.He heard a little cry, felt his feet
strike some tin utensil, and rolled on the ground beside Eugenia and her
overturned watering-pot.They both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to
laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each."But we are not on the mountains now, Mr.Bray," said Eugenia, taking
her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening
eyebrows."But we are quits," said Bray.I only
came here to tell you why I could not answer your letter the same day.I
never got it--I mean," he added hurriedly, "another man got it first."She threw up her head, and her face grew pale."ANOTHER man got it," she
repeated, "and YOU let another man"--

"No, no," interrupted Bray imploringly.One of my
partners went to the spring that afternoon, and found it; but he neither
knows who sent it, nor for whom it was intended."He hastily recounted
Parkhurst's story, his mysterious belief, and his interpretation of
the note.The color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and
eyes."I had gone twice to the spring after I saw you, but I couldn't
bear its deserted look without you," he added boldly.Here, seeing her
face grew grave again, he added, "But how did you get the letter to the
spring?and how did you know that it was found that day?"It was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating, but the combination
was charming in her proud face."I got the little schoolboy at the
summit," she said, with girlish hesitation, "to take the note.He knew
the spring, but he didn't know YOU.I told him--it was very foolish, I
know--to wait until you came for water, to be certain that you got the
note, to wait until you came up, for I thought you might question him,
or give him some word.""But," she added,
and her lip took a divine pout, "he said he waited TWO HOURS; that you
never took the LEAST CONCERN of the letter or him, but went around the
mountain side, peering and picking in every hole and corner of it, and
then he got tired and ran away.Of course I understand it now, it wasn't
YOU; but oh, please; I beg you, Mr.Bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught, and which
had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment."And now, don't you think, Mr.Bray," she added demurely, "that you had
better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door
and call upon me properly?""But your father"--

"My father, as a well-known investor, regrets exceedingly that he did
not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview.He is, as your foreman knows, exceedingly interested in the mines on
Eureka ledge.She led him to a little
door in the wall, which she unbolted."And now 'Jill' must say good-by
to 'Jack,' for she must make herself ready to receive a Mr.And when Bray a little later called at the front door, he was
respectfully announced.He called another day, and many days after.He
came frequently to San Francisco, and one day did not return to his old
partners.He had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared
"had made the first strike on Eureka mountain."BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER


I

When Joshua Bilson, of the Summit House, Buckeye Hill, lost his wife,
it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the
management of the hotel.Already all Buckeye had considered this a mere
preliminary to taking another wife, after a decent probation, as the
relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate,
and Bilson was a man, and not above female influence.There was,
however, some change of opinion on that point when Miss Euphemia Trotter
was engaged for that position.Buckeye Hill, which had confidently
looked forward to a buxom widow or, with equal confidence, to the
promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid, was startled
by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age, and above the medium
height, at once serious, precise, and masterful, and to all appearances
outrageously competent.More carefully "taking stock" of her, it was
accepted she had three good points,--dark, serious eyes, a trim but
somewhat thin figure, and well-kept hands and feet.These, which in
so susceptible a community would have been enough, in the words of one
critic, "to have married her to three men," she seemed to make of little
account herself, and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make
them of account was ceremonious and frigid.Indeed, she seemed to occupy
herself entirely with looking after the servants, Chinese and Europeans,
examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers, in a fashion
that made her respected and--feared.It was whispered, in fact, that
Bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife, and that he was
"henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet."Nevertheless, he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence
that seemed incompatible with their relative positions.It gave rise
to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting: Miss Trotter had a
secret interest in the hotel, and represented a San Francisco syndicate;
Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property, and had advanced large
sums to Bilson; Miss Trotter was a woman of no property, but she was
the only daughter of--variously--a late distinguished nobleman, a ruined
millionaire, and a foreign statesman, bent on making her own living.Miss Euphemia Trotter, or "Miss E. Trotter," as she
preferred to sign herself, loathing her sentimental prefix, was really
a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary, where
she eventually became a teacher.She had survived her parents and a
neglected childhood, and had worked hard for her living since she
was fourteen.She had been a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a
reformatory, had observed men and women under conditions of pain and
weakness, and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness
and suffering; yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy
which she used equally to herself as to others.That she had ever
indulged in any romance of human existence, I greatly doubt; the lanky
girl teacher at the Vermont academy had enough to do to push herself
forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences, and so
became a prematurely hard duenna, paid to look out for, restrain, and
report, if necessary, any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her
companions.A pronounced "old maid" at fifteen, she had nothing to
forget or forgive in others, and still less to learn from them.It was spring, and down the long <DW72>s of Buckeye Hill the flowers were
already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains, and the
winds no longer brought their monotonous patter.In the pine woods there
were the song and flash of birds, and the quickening stimulus of the
stirring aromatic sap.Miners and tunnelmen were already forsaking
the direct road for a ramble through the woodland trail and its sylvan
charms, and occasionally breaking into shouts and horseplay like great
boys.The schoolchildren were disporting there; there were some older
couples sentimentally gathering flowers side by side.Miss Trotter was
also there, but making a short cut from the bank and express office, and
by no means disturbed by any gentle reminiscence of her girlhood or any
other instinctive participation in the wanton season.Spring came, she
knew, regularly every year, and brought "spring cleaning" and other
necessary changes and rehabilitations.This year it had brought also
a considerable increase in the sum she was putting by, and she
was, perhaps, satisfied in a practical way, if not with the blind
instinctiveness of others.She was walking leisurely, holding her gray
skirt well over her slim ankles and smartly booted feet, and clear of
the brushing of daisies and buttercups, when suddenly she stopped.A few
paces before her, partly concealed by a myrtle, a young woman, startled
at her approach, had just withdrawn herself from the embrace of a young
man and slipped into the shadow.Nevertheless, in that moment, Miss
Trotter's keen eyes had recognized her as a very pretty Swedish girl,
one of her chambermaids at the hotel.Miss Trotter passed without a
word, but gravely.She was not shocked nor surprised, but it struck
her practical mind at once that if this were an affair with impending
matrimony, it meant the loss of a valuable and attractive servant; if
otherwise, a serious disturbance of that servant's duties.She must look
out for another girl to take the place of Frida Pauline Jansen, that
was all.It is possible, therefore, that Miss Jansen's criticism of Miss
Trotter to her companion as a "spying, jealous old cat" was unfair.This
companion Miss Trotter had noticed, only to observe that his face and
figure were unfamiliar to her.His red shirt and heavy boots gave no
indication of his social condition in that locality.He seemed more
startled and disturbed at her intrusion than the girl had been, but
that was more a condition of sex than of degree, she also knew.In
such circumstances it is the woman always who is the most composed and
self-possessed.A few days after this, Miss Trotter was summoned in some haste to the
office.Chris Calton, a young man of twenty-six, partner in the Roanoke
Ledge, had fractured his arm and collar-bone by a fall, and had been
brought to the hotel for that rest and attention, under medical advice,
which he could not procure in the Roanoke company's cabin.She had
a retired, quiet room made ready.When he was installed there by the
doctor she went to see him, and found a good-looking, curly headed young
fellow, even boyish in appearance and manner, who received her with that
air of deference and timidity which she was accustomed to excite in the
masculine breast--when it was not accompanied with distrust.It struck
her that he was somewhat emotional, and had the expression of one who
had been spoiled and petted by women, a rather unusual circumstance
among the men of the locality.Perhaps it would be unfair to her to say
that a disposition to show him that he could expect no such "nonsense"
THERE sprang up in her heart at that moment, for she never had
understood any tolerance of such weakness, but a certain precision and
dryness of manner was the only result of her observation.She adjusted
his pillow, asked him if there was anything that he wanted, but took her
directions from the doctor, rather than from himself, with a practical
insight and minuteness that was as appalling to the patient as it was an
unexpected delight to Dr."I see you quite understand me, Miss
Trotter," he said, with great relief."I ought to," responded the lady dryly."I had a dozen such cases, some
of them with complications, while I was assistant at the Sacramento
Hospital."returned the doctor, dropping gladly into purely
professional detail, "you'll see this is very simple, not a comminuted
fracture; constitution and blood healthy; all you've to do is to see
that he eats properly, keeps free from excitement and worry, but does
not get despondent; a little company; his partners and some of the boys
from the Ledge will drop in occasionally; not too much of THEM, you
know; and of course, absolute immobility of the injured parts."The lady
nodded; the patient lifted his blue eyes for an instant to hers with
a look of tentative appeal, but it slipped off Miss Trotter's dark
pupils--which were as abstractedly critical as the doctor's--without
being absorbed by them.When the door closed behind her, the doctor
exclaimed: "By Jove!"Do what
she says, and we'll pull you through in no time.she's able to
adjust those bandages herself!"This, indeed, she did a week later, when the surgeon had failed to call,
unveiling his neck and arm with professional coolness, and supporting
him in her slim arms against her stiff, erect buckramed breast, while
she replaced the splints with masculine firmness of touch and serene
and sexless indifference.His stammered embarrassed thanks at the
relief--for he had been in considerable pain--she accepted with a
certain pride as a tribute to her skill, a tribute which Dr.Duchesne
himself afterward fully indorsed.On re-entering his room the third or fourth morning after his advent at
the Summit House, she noticed with some concern that there was a slight
flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought
presaged fever.But an examination of his pulse and temperature
dispelled that fear, and his talkativeness and good spirits convinced
her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his
despondency.A few days later, this cheerfulness not being continued,
Dr.Duchesne followed Miss Trotter into the hall."We must try to keep
our patient from moping in his confinement, you know," he began, with
a slight smile, "and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature,
accustomed to be amused and--er--er--petted.""His friends were here yesterday," returned Miss Trotter dryly, "but I
did not interfere with them until I thought they had stayed long enough
to suit your wishes.""I am not referring to THEM," said the doctor, still smiling; "but you
know a woman's sympathy and presence in a sickroom is often the best of
tonics or sedatives."Miss Trotter raised her eyes to the speaker with a half critical
impatience."The fact is," the doctor went on, "I have a favor to ask of you for our
patient.It seems that the other morning a new chambermaid waited upon
him, whom he found much more gentle and sympathetic in her manner than
the others, and more submissive and quiet in her ways--possibly because
she is a foreigner, and accustomed to servitude.I suppose you have no
objection to HER taking charge of his room?"Not from wounded vanity, but
from the consciousness of some want of acumen that had made her make a
mistake.She had really believed, from her knowledge of the patient's
character and the doctor's preamble, that he wished HER to show some
more kindness and personal sympathy to the young man, and had even been
prepared to question its utility!She saw her blunder quickly, and at
once remembering that the pretty Swedish girl had one morning taken the
place of an absent fellow servant, in the rebound from her error, she
said quietly: "You mean Frida!she can look after his
room, if he prefers her."But for her blunder she might have added
conscientiously that she thought the girl would prove inefficient, but
she did not.She remembered the incident of the wood; yet if the girl
had a lover in the wood, she could not urge it as a proof of incapacity.She gave the necessary orders, and the incident passed.Visiting the patient a few days afterward, she could not help noticing a
certain shy gratitude in Mr.Calton's greeting of her, which she quietly
ignored.This forced the ingenuous Chris to more positive speech.He dwelt with great simplicity and enthusiasm on the Swedish girl's
gentleness and sympathy."You have no idea of--her--natural tenderness,
Miss Trotter," he stammered naively.Miss Trotter, remembering the
wood, thought to herself that she had some faint idea of it, but did not
impart what it was.He spoke also of her beauty, not being clever enough
to affect an indifference or ignorance of it, which made Miss Trotter
respect him and smile an unqualified acquiescence.But when he spoke of her as "Miss Jansen," and said she was so
much more "ladylike and refined than the other servants," she replied by
asking him if his bandages hurt him, and, receiving a negative answer,
graciously withdrew.Indeed, his bandages gave him little trouble now, and his improvement
was so marked and sustained that the doctor was greatly gratified,
and, indeed, expressed as much to Miss Trotter, with the conscientious
addition that he believed the greater part of it was due to her capable
nursing!"Yes, ma'am, he has to thank YOU for it, and no one else!"Miss Trotter raised her dark eyes and looked steadily at him.Accustomed
as he was to men and women, the look strongly held him.He saw in her
eyes an intelligence equal to his own, a knowledge of good and evil, and
a toleration and philosophy, equal to his own, but a something else that
was as distinct and different as their sex.And therein lay its charm,
for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty
eyes, which he had never noticed before, without any aggressive
intellectual quality.came the man's propensity to
reason.It meant of course but ONE thing; he saw it all now!If HE, in
his preoccupation and coolness, had noticed her eyes, so also had the
younger and emotional Chris.It
was that which had stimulated his recovery, and she was wondering if he,
the doctor, had observed it.He smiled back the superior smile of our
sex in moments of great inanity, and poor Miss Trotter believed he
understood her.A few days after this, she noticed that Frida Jansen was
wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket.Bilson had told her that the Roanoke Ledge was very rich,
and that Calton was likely to prove a profitable guest.It became her business, however, some days later, when Mr.Calton was so
much better that he could sit in a chair, or even lounge listlessly
in the hall and corridor.It so chanced that she was passing along
the upper hall when she saw Frida's pink cotton skirt disappear in an
adjacent room, and heard her light laugh as the door closed.But the
room happened to be a card-room reserved exclusively for gentlemen's
poker or euchre parties, and the chambermaids had no business there.Miss Trotter had no doubt that Mr.Calton was there, and that Frida knew
it; but as this was an indiscretion so open, flagrant, and likely to be
discovered by the first passing guest, she called to her sharply.She
was astonished, however, at the same moment to see Mr.Calton walking in
the corridor at some distance from the room in question.Indeed, she was
so confounded that when Frida appeared from the room a little flurried,
but with a certain audacity new to her, Miss Trotter withheld her
rebuke, and sent her off on an imaginary errand, while she herself
opened the card-room door.Bilson, her employer;
his explanation was glaringly embarrassed and unreal!Miss Trotter
affected obliviousness, but was silent; perhaps she thought her employer
was better able to take care of himself than Mr.A week later this tension terminated by the return of Calton to Roanoke
Ledge, a convalescent man.A very pretty watch and chain afterward were
received by Miss Trotter, with a few lines expressing the gratitude of
the ex-patient.Bilson was highly delighted, and frequently borrowed
the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing
powers of the Summit Hotel.Calton sent to the more attractive
and flirtatious Frida did not as publicly appear, and possibly Mr.Since that discovery, Miss Trotter had felt herself debarred from taking
the girl's conduct into serious account, and it did not interfere with
her work.II

One afternoon Miss Trotter received a message that Mr.Calton desired
a few moments' private conversation with her.A little curious, she had
him shown into one of the sitting-rooms, but was surprised on entering
to find that she was in the presence of an utter stranger!This was
explained by the visitor saying briefly that he was Chris's elder
brother, and that he presumed the name would be sufficient introduction.Miss Trotter smiled doubtfully, for a more distinct opposite to Chris
could not be conceived.The stranger was apparently strong, practical,
and masterful in all those qualities in which his brother was charmingly
weak.Miss Trotter, for no reason whatever, felt herself inclined to
resent them."I reckon, Miss Trotter," he said bluntly, "that you don't know anything
of this business that brings me here.At least," he hesitated, with a
certain rough courtesy, "I should judge from your general style and gait
that you wouldn't have let it go on so far if you had, but the fact is,
that darned fool brother of mine--beg your pardon!--has gone and got
himself engaged to one of the girls that help here,--a yellow-haired
foreigner, called Frida Jansen.""I was not aware that it had gone so far as that," said Miss Trotter
quietly, "although his admiration for her was well known, especially to
his doctor, at whose request I selected her to especially attend to your
brother.""The doctor is a fool," broke in Mr."He only thought
of keeping Chris quiet while he finished his job."Calton," continued Miss Trotter, ignoring the
interruption, "I do not see what right I have to interfere with the
matrimonial intentions of any guest in this house, even though or--as
you seem to put it--BECAUSE the object of his attentions is in its
employ."Calton stared--angrily at first, and then with a kind of wondering
amazement that any woman--above all a housekeeper--should take such a
view."But," he stammered, "I thought you--you--looked after the conduct
of those girls.""I'm afraid you've assumed too much," said Miss Trotter placidly."My
business is to see that they attend to their duties here.Frida Jansen's
duty was--as I have just told you--to look after your brother's room.And as far as I understand you, you are not here to complain of her
inattention to that duty, but of its resulting in an attachment on your
brother's part, and, as you tell me, an intention as to her future,
which is really the one thing that would make my 'looking after her
conduct' an impertinence and interference!If you had come to tell me
that he did NOT intend to marry her, but was hurting her reputation, I
could have understood and respected your motives."Calton felt his face grow red and himself discomfited.He had come
there with the firm belief that he would convict Miss Trotter of a grave
fault, and that in her penitence she would be glad to assist him in
breaking off the match.On the contrary, to find himself arraigned and
put on his defense by this tall, slim woman, erect and smartly buckramed
in logic and whalebone, was preposterous!But it had the effect of
subduing his tone."You don't understand," he said awkwardly yet pleadingly."My brother is
a fool, and any woman could wind him round her finger.She knows he is rich and a partner in the Roanoke Ledge.I've said he was a fool--but,
hang it all!that's no reason why he should marry an ignorant girl--a
foreigner and a servant--when he could do better elsewhere.""This would seem to be a matter between you and your brother, and not
between myself and my servant," said Miss Trotter coldly."If you
cannot convince HIM, your own brother, I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER, a servant, over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK, when, on your own showing, she has everything
to gain by the marriage.Bilson, the proprietor, to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brother,"--Miss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the card-room incident,--"it
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage."His reason told him
that she was right.More than that, a certain admiration for her
clear-sightedness began to possess him, with the feeling that he would
like to have "shown up" a little better than he had in this interview.If Chris had fallen in love with HER--but Chris was a fool and wouldn't
have appreciated her!"But you might talk with her, Miss Trotter," he said, now completely
subdued."Even if you could not reason her out of it, you might find
out what she expects from this marriage.If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me"--

"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have," said
Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr.Calton thought quite pretty,
"but I will see about it."Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire.She certainly
was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day,
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and post-office.Her way home again lay through the Summit woods.It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Frida's flirtations.Bilson's presumed gallantries,
however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world,
with a serious engagement with young Calton.She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr.Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood;
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long
ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains.She
smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections.Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex;
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion?Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret.Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense
against such sentiment.Was there something in her manner that forbade
it?She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against
it.It was quite warm; she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait, and checked herself, halting in the warm breath of the
syringas.Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized,
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts.She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her, panting, partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment.His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile; his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern."I saw you--go into the wood--but I lost you," he said, breathing
quickly, "and then when I did see you again--you were walking so fast
I had to run after you.I wanted--to speak--to you--if you'll let me.I
won't detain you--I can walk your way."Miss Trotter was a little softened, but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation.She drew her neat skirts aside, and made way for
him on the path beside her."You see," he went on nervously, taking long strides to her shorter
ones, and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment, "my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida, and trying to
put you against her and me.He said as much to me, and added you half
promised to help him!But I didn't believe him--Miss Trotter!--I know
you wouldn't do it--you haven't got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl!He says he has every confidence in you--that you're worth a dozen
such girls as she is, and that I'm a big fool or I'd see it.I don't
say you're not all he says, Miss Trotter; but I'm not such a fool as he
thinks, for I know your GOODNESS too.I know how you tended me when
I was ill, and how you sent Frida to comfort me.You know, too,--for
you're a woman yourself,--that all you could say, or anybody could,
wouldn't separate two people who loved each other."Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed, and this made her a
little angry."I don't think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter," she said icily; "and if you are quite
satisfied, as you say you are, of your own affection and Frida's, I do
not see why you should care for anybody'sinterference.""Now you are angry with me," he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth; "and I've just done it.Oh,
Miss Trotter, don't!I didn't mean to say your talk
was no good.I didn't mean to say you couldn't help us.He reached out his hand, grasped her slim fingers in his own, and
pressed them, holding them and even arresting her passage.The act was
without familiarity or boldness, and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning, instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it.She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk, and said, with a smile:--

"Then you confess you need help--in what way?"Was
it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity?"Then you are not quite sure of her?""She's so high spirited, you know," he said humbly, "and so attractive,
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of her,--well!"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despair--"there's no knowing what she might do."Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower,
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides.Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said,
"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.""I don't say that, Miss Trotter," said Chris pleadingly, yet with a
slight wincing at her words; "YOU could convince her, if you would only
try.Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself.Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there!If you will only
help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until
you have talked with her.Even my brother would not object
to that.And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've
more--don't you see?Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?"He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers.Indeed, it seemed to
her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness.None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple, weak, and loving young man.Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.Nevertheless, this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense.She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then said, with a
faint smile, "Perhaps she does not trust YOU.He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment.It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter; eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color,
clearness, and half tender insight.He dropped her hand with a new-found
timidity, and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer."I mean," she said, stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable "buckeyes" marked the extreme edge of the
woods,--"I mean that you are still very young, and as Frida is
nearly your own age,"--she could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendo,--"she may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition; she may even think my interference is a proof of it; but,"
she added quickly, to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her, "I will speak to her,
and," she concluded playfully, "you must take the consequences."He said "Thank you," but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested, and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes.Miss
Trotter did not notice it, as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away."Look," she said in a lower
voice, "I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing."It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them.There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure, nor the long yellow braids that hung Marguerite-wise
down her back.With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried, there was, in spite of her affected ease, a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head, as if evading or seeking
observation."I will overtake her and speak to her now," continued Miss Trotter."I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone.You can wait here
for my return, if you like."he stammered, with a
faint, tentative smile."Perhaps--don't you think?--I had better go
first and tell her you want to see her.You see,
she might"--He stopped."It was part of your promise, you know, that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken.She has just gone into the
grove."Without another word the young man turned away, and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared.Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed, and, gathering
her skirts about her, sat down to wait.The unwonted attitude, the
whole situation, and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint child's play out of her
lost youth, and she smiled, albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes.Indeed, as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol, the
casual passer-by might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst.She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left, wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous; and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her, her smile became a nervous laugh, and
she found herself actually blushing!He
was walking directly towards her with slow, determined steps, quite
different from his previous nervous agitation, and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance: his
colorful face was pale, his eyes fixed, and he looked ten years older."I came back to tell you," he said, in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed, "that I relieve you of your promise.It
won't be necessary for you to see--Frida.I thank you all the same, Miss
Trotter," he said, avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner."It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me, and to wait here, and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer.Sometime I may tell
you, but not now."asked Miss Trotter quickly, premising Frida's
refusal from his face.He hesitated a moment, then he said gravely, "Yes.Don't ask me any
more, Miss Trotter, please.He paused, and then, with a
slight, uneasy glance toward the pine grove, "Don't let me keep you
waiting here any longer."He took her hand, held it lightly for a
moment, and said, "Go, now."Miss Trotter, slightly bewildered and unsatisfied, nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail.He gazed after her for a moment, and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the <DW72> where he had first
overtaken her, and was soon out of sight.Miss Trotter continued her way
home; but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned, as
if taking some sudden resolution, and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove.What she expected to see there,
possibly she could not have explained; what she actually saw after a
moment's waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr.Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry.Frida's manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity; and although they believed themselves
alone, her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation, indicative of the peasant.But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences.Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness.Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her, and then took
a shorter cut home.She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr.She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool, self-possessed presence.He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen; but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotter's position in the hotel, except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment.He was to be married in San Francisco at
once, and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two; indeed,
he contemplated eventually retiring from business.Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter, which she had ignored, she never betrayed
the least recollection of it.She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness.Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter, an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to, she was, nevertheless,
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chris's
disappointment and unhappiness.Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him; that he had been saved an ill-assorted marriage; that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning.Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings.It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity.She thought of his
boyish appeal to her; of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Frida's relations to Mr.Bilson that afternoon, but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him.How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss!How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion!The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts.It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel; it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression.Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage, he had enjoined secrecy upon her, and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother, who, had he known of Frida's
engagement, would have naturally come to her for explanation.It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother.III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill, it did not, however,
make much scandal, owing, possibly, to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it, and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown.Bilson would be absent for a year,
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter, DID, however, create a stir in that practical business
community.Every one knew
that to Miss Trotter's tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due.Possibly, the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else.Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction; the wives and daughters of the banker, the lawyer, and the
pastor had made much of her, and now, as an independent woman of means,
she stood first in the district.Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her.The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess; middle-aged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California.The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
again,--they had known she was a "real lady" from the first!She
received these attentions, as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament, without pride, affectation, or hesitation.Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr.Bilson's marriage was made known,
and she was called upon by James Calton."I did you a great injustice," he said, with a smile."I don't understand you," she replied a little coldly."Why, this woman and her marriage," he said; "you must have known
something of it all the time, and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris.""You are mistaken," returned Miss Trotter truthfully."Then I have wronged you still more," he said briskly, "for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness.Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him.""Let me tell you once for all, Mr.Calton," she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted, "that I did not interfere in any way
with your brother's suit.He spoke to me of it, and I promised to see
Frida, but he afterwards asked me not to.Calton, "WHATEVER you did, it was most efficacious,
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you, if, indeed, he hasn't really transferred his
affections to you."Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence, or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes.Yet for an instant this calm, collected
woman trembled, not at what Mr.Calton might have noticed, but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF.Calton, construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued
hurriedly:--

"I mean, don't you see, that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have.""You mean, I think, that he has taken his broken heart very lightly,"
said Miss Trotter, with a bitter little laugh, so unlike herself that
Mr.He's regularly cut up, you
know!More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be," he went on, with brotherly directness."It
wouldn't be a bad thing, you know, if you could manage to see him, Miss
Trotter!In fact, as he's off his feed, and has some trouble with his
arm again, owing to all this, I reckon, I've been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till he's better.So long as SHE'S
gone it would be all right, you know!"By this time Miss Trotter was herself again.She reasoned, or thought
she did, that this was a question of the business of the hotel, and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming.The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely.Luckily, she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting.His face had lost its fresh color and round outline; the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache;
his eyes, which had sought hers with a singular seriousness, no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her,
but were filled with an older experience.Indeed, he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that, by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions, she felt herself much younger, and in smile and eye showed
it; at which he  faintly.But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health, and made no allusion to his past
experiences; indeed, ignoring any connection between the two.He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence, had had a relapse in
consequence, and deserved a good scolding!His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure!She should treat him
more severely now, and allow him no indulgences!I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert, but their eyes met and he 
again.Ignoring this also, and promising to look after him occasionally,
she quietly withdrew.But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter.Always scrupulously correct, and even severe in her dress, she
allowed herself certain privileges of color, style, and material.She,
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars,
came out in delicate tints and laces, which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls, slightly tinged with gray.One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white,
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy.The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive; even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition, but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age.For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer.One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air.It was the former "card-room" of the hotel, but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness.She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the
last vestige of his youth."It's very kind of you to invite me in here," he began bitterly, "when
you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool!""I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself," she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else."And I'm a baby who can't," he said angrily.After a pause he burst out
abruptly: "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?""Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood?"she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brother's suggestion.Bilson told
me the same evening.""And I only knew it when news came of their marriage," he said bitterly."But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood," she responded."When I saw them together in the wood?"Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short.Was it possible he had not
seen them together?She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too
late to withdraw her words."Yes," she went on hurriedly, "I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her."He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: "You thought that?I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had
changed my mind!"I did not love
the girl--I never loved her--I was sick of my folly.Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer.Now you know why I didn't go into the wood,
and why I didn't care where she was nor who was with her!""I don't understand," she said, lifting her clear eyes to his coldly."Of course you don't," he said bitterly.And when you do understand you will hate and despise me--if you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool!Hear me out, Miss Trotter, for I am
speaking the truth to you now, if I never spoke it before.I never asked
the girl to marry me!I never said to HER half what I told to YOU, and
when I asked you to intercede with her, I never wanted you to do it--and
never expected you would.""May I ask WHY you did it then?"said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness."You would not believe me if I told you, and you would hate me if you
did."He stopped, and, locking his fingers together, threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her."You never liked me,
Miss Trotter," he said more quietly; "not from the first!From the day
that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy.When I tried to catch
your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him.And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were,
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have.You may not believe me, but
I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen,
and you were so different from the other girls I knew, or the women who
had been kind to me.You may laugh, but it's the truth I'm telling you,
Miss Trotter!"He had relapsed completely into his old pleading, boyish way--it had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida!"I knew you didn't like me that day you came to change the bandages.Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain, you did it so
coldly and precisely; and although I longed to keep you there with me,
you scarcely waited to take my thanks, but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger.And worst of all," he went on more
bitterly, "the doctor knew it too--guessed how I felt toward you, and
laughed at me for my hopelessness!That made me desperate, and put me up
to act the fool.Yes, Miss Trotter; I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida, and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly.And when you simply consented, without a word or
thought about it and me, I knew I was nothing to you."Duchesne's
strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew might
have been the truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words.It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what
else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast.She
felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get
up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless.Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived
her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell
that was upon her, nor did she want to.She must know the culmination of
this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely."The girl was kind and sympathetic," he went on, "but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention.I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he
would tell you, as he did.He would not tell me what you said to him,
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida.Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I
did.I know it was a stupid, clumsy contrivance.It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you.It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me, and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness.And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another.You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised.Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs."She turned quietly, passionately, and, standing up, faced him with a
little cry.He rose too, and catching her hands in his, said, with a white face,
"Because I love you."*****

Half an hour later, when the under-housekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotter's orders, she found that lady quietly writing at the table.Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr.Calton's
rooms would be vacated the next day.When the servant, who, like most of
her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris,
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss
Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that
she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course.She finished her
letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr.Bilson at
Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom,
with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the
last post.As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the
departing guest."It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr.Calton couldn't
stay, as he always said you did him so much good."But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh,
and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands,
cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl.Calton's departure became known the next day, some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor.Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two.He did return for a day; it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life.Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the
difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests.It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand.When, three months later,
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr.Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant.A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs.Boompointer;
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger.Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr.Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew
her no more.Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome,
stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least.They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady.But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation."I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now," said the
baroness critically."But there are a few of your compatriots here,
however, and they are always amusing.You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor?That is her position day after day,
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here.Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where
it's all the other way, is it not?And there is an odd story about her
which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect.They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel.""You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one," said
Miss Trotter, smiling.I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully
ignorant at that!"Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny,
said gently, "I think you are a little severe.That was the name of her FIRST
husband.I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a
fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so
funny.said Miss Trotter after a pause, in
a still gentler voice.He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg.You will find HER very stupid,
but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women.Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject.But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons.From that day forward, the little captain and the tall
grenadier became the best of friends, and years after, on the evening of
the 11th of March, 1858, when the killed and wounded were collected
after the capture of the Begum's Kothee in Lucknow, I saw Captain
Burroughs crying like a tender-hearted woman by the side of a _dooly_ in
which was stretched the dead body of Donald MacLean, who, it was said,
received his death-wound defending his captain.I have the authority of
the late colour-sergeant of No.6 company for the statement that from
the date of the death of MacLean, Captain Burroughs regularly remitted
thirty shillings a month, through the minister of her parish, to
Donald's widowed mother, till the day of her death seven years after.When an action of this kind became generally known in the regiment, it
caused many to look with kindly feelings on most of the peculiarities of
Burroughs.The other anecdote goes back to Camp Kamara and the spring of 1856, when
the Highland Brigade were lying there half-way between Balaclava and
Sebastopol.As before noticed, Burroughs was more like a Frenchman than
a Highlander; there were many of his old _Polytechnique_ chums in the
French army in the Crimea, and almost every day he had some visitors
from the French camp, especially after the armistice was proclaimed.Some time in the spring of 1856 Burroughs had picked up a Tartar pony
and had got a saddle, etc., for it, but he could get no regular groom.Not being a field-officer he was not entitled to a regulation groom, and
not being well liked, none of his company would volunteer for the
billet, especially as it formed no excuse for getting off other duties.One of the company had accordingly to be detailed on fatigue duty every
day to groom the captain's pony.On a particular day this duty had
fallen to a young recruit who had lately joined by draft, a man named
Patrick Doolan, a real Paddy of the true Handy Andy type, who had made
his way somehow to Glasgow and had there enlisted into the Ninety-Third.This day, as usual, Burroughs had visitors from the French camp, and it
was proposed that all should go for a ride, so Patrick Doolan was called
to saddle the captain's pony.Doolan had never saddled a pony in his
life before, and he put the saddle on with the pommel to the tail and
the crupper to the front, and brought the pony thus accoutred to the
captain's hut.Every one commenced to laugh, and Burroughs, getting into
a white heat, turned on Patrick, saying, "You fool, you have put the
saddle on with the back to the front!"Patrick at once saluted, and,
without the least hesitation, replied, "Shure, sir, you never told me
whether you were to ride to Balaclava or the front."Burroughs was so
tickled with the ready wit of the reply that from that day he took
Doolan into his service as soldier-servant, taught him his work, and
retained him till March, 1858, when Burroughs had to go on sick leave
on account of wounds.Burroughs was one of the last men wounded in the
taking of Lucknow.Some days after the Begum's Kothee was stormed, he
and his company were sent to drive a lot of rebels out of a house near
the Kaiserbagh, and, as usual, Burroughs was well in advance of his men.Just as they were entering the place the enemy fired a mine, and the
captain was sent about a hundred feet in the air; but being like a cat
(in the matter of being difficult to kill, I mean), he fell on his feet
on the roof of a thatched hut, and escaped, with his life indeed, but
with one of his legs broken in two places below the knee.It was only
the skill of our good doctor Munro that saved his leg; but he was sent
to England on sick leave, and before he returned I had left the regiment
and joined the Commissariat Department.This ends my reminiscences of
Captain Burroughs.May he long enjoy the rank he has attained in the
peace of his island home in Orkney!Notwithstanding his peculiarities,
he was a brave and plucky soldier and a most kind-hearted gentleman.By the end of March the Ninety-Third returned to camp at the Dilkoosha,
glad to get out of the city, where we were suffocated by the stench of
rotting corpses, and almost devoured with flies by day and mosquitoes by
night.The weather was now very hot and altogether uncomfortable, more
especially since we were without any means of bathing and could obtain
no regular changes of clothing.By this time numbers of the townspeople had returned to the city and
were putting their houses in order, while thousands of _coolies_ and
low-caste natives were employed clearing dead bodies out of houses and
hidden corners, and generally cleaning up the city.When we repassed the scene of our hard-contested struggle, the Begum's
palace,--which, I may here remark, was actually a much stronger position
than the famous Redan at Sebastopol,--we found the inner ditch, that had
given us so much trouble to get across, converted into a vast grave, in
which the dead had been collected in thousands and then covered by the
earth which the enemy had piled up as ramparts.All round Lucknow for
miles the country was covered with dead carcases of every kind,--human
beings, horses, camels, bullocks, and donkeys,--and for miles the
atmosphere was tainted and the swarms of flies were horrible, a positive
torment and a nuisance.The only comfort was that they roosted at night;
but at meal-times they were indescribable, and it was impossible to keep
them out of our food; our plates of rice would be perfectly black with
flies, and it was surprising how we kept such good health, for we had
little or no sickness during the siege of Lucknow.During the few days we remained in camp at the Dilkoosha the army was
broken up into movable columns, to take the field after the different
parties of rebels and to restore order throughout Oude; for although
Lucknow had fallen, the rebellion was not by any means over; the whole
of Oude was still against us, and had to be reconquered.The
Forty-Second, Seventy-Ninth, and Ninety-Third (the regiments which
composed the famous old Highland Brigade of the Crimea) were once more
formed into one brigade, and with a regiment of Punjab Infantry and a
strong force of engineers, the Ninth Lancers, a regiment of native
cavalry, a strong force of artillery, both light and heavy,--in brief,
as fine a little army as ever took the field, under the command of
General Walpole, with Adrian Hope as brigadier,--was detailed for the
advance into Rohilcund for the recapture of Bareilly, where a large army
still held together under Khan Bahadoor Khan.Every one in the camp
expressed surprise that Sir Colin should entrust his favourite
Highlanders to Walpole.On the morning of the 7th of April, 1858, the time had at last arrived
when we were to leave Lucknow, and the change was hailed by us with
delight.We were glad to get away from the captured city, with its
horrible smells and still more horrible sights, and looked forward with
positive pleasure to a hot-weather campaign in Rohilcund.We were to
advance on Bareilly by a route parallel with the course of the Ganges,
so striking our tents at 2 A.M.we marched through the city
along the right bank of the Goomtee, past the Moosabagh, where our first
halt was made, about five miles out of Lucknow, in the midst of fresh
fields, away from all the offensive odours and the myriads of flies.One
instance will suffice to give my readers some idea of the torment we
suffered from these pests.When we struck tents all the flies were
roosting in the roofs; when the tents were rolled up the flies got
crushed and killed by bushels, and no one who has not seen such a sight
would credit the state of the inside of our tents when opened out to be
repitched on the new ground.After the tents were pitched and the roofs
swept down, the sweepers of each company were called to collect the dead
flies and carry them out of the camp.I noted down the quantity of flies
carried out of my own tent.The ordinary kitchen-baskets served out to
the regimental cooks by the commissariat for carrying bread, rice, etc.,
will hold about an imperial bushel, and from one tent there were carried
out five basketfuls of dead flies.The sight gave one a practical idea
of one of the ten plagues of Egypt!Being now rid of the flies we could
lie down during the heat of the day, and have a sleep without being
tormented.The defeated army of Lucknow had flocked into Rohilcund, and a large
force was reported to be collected in Bareilly under Khan Bahadoor Khan
and Prince Feroze Shah.The following is a copy of one of Khan Bahadoor
Khan's proclamations for the harassment of our advance: "Do not attempt
to meet the regular columns of the infidels, because they are superior
to you in discipline and have more guns; but watch their movements;
guard all the _ghats_ on the rivers, intercept their communications;
stop their supplies; cut up their piquets and _daks_; keep constantly
hanging about their camps; give them no rest!"These were, no doubt,
the correct tactics; it was the old Mahratta policy revived.However,
nothing came of it, and our advance was unopposed till we reached the
jungle fort of Nirput Singh, the Rajpoot chief of Rooyah, near the
village of Rhodamow.I was in the
advance-guard under command of a young officer who had just come out
from home as a cadet in the H.E.I.Company's service, and there being no
Company's regiments for him, he was attached to the Ninety-Third before
we left Lucknow.His name was Wace, a tall young lad of, I suppose,
sixteen or seventeen years of age.I don't remember him before that
morning, but he was most anxious for a fight, and I recollect that
before we marched off our camping-ground, Brigadier Hope called up young
Mr.Wace, and gave him instructions about moving along with great
caution with about a dozen picked men for the leading section of the
advance-guard.We advanced without opposition till sunrise, and then we came in sight
of an outpost of the enemy about three miles from the fort; but as soon
as they saw us they retired, and word was passed back to the column.Shortly afterwards instructions came for the advance-guard to wait for
the main column, and I remember young Mr.Wace going up to the
brigadier, and asking to be permitted to lead the assault on the fort,
should it come to a fight.At this time a summons to surrender had been
sent to the Raja, but he vouchsafed no reply, and, as we advanced, a
9-pounder shot was fired at the head of the column, killing a drummer
of the Forty-Second.The attack on the fort then commenced, without any
attempt being made to reconnoitre the position, and ended in a most
severe loss, Brigadier Hope being among the killed.Lieutenant
Willoughby, who commanded the Sikhs,--a brother of the officer who blew
up the powder-magazine at Delhi, rather than let it fall into the hands
of the enemy,--was also killed; as were Lieutenants Douglas and Bramley
of the Forty-Second, with nearly one hundred men, Highlanders and Sikhs.Hope was shot from a high tree inside the fort, and, at the time, it was
believed that the man who shot him was a European.[43] After we retired
from the fort the excitement was so great among the men of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, owing to the sacrifice of so many
officers and men through sheer mismanagement, that if the officers had
given the men the least encouragement, I am convinced they would have
turned out in a body and hanged General Walpole.The officers who were
killed were all most popular men; but the great loss sustained by the
death of Adrian Hope positively excited the men to fury.So heated was
the feeling on the night the dead were buried, that if any
non-commissioned officer had dared to take the lead, the life of General
Walpole would not have been worth half an hour's purchase.After the force retired,--for we actually retired!--from Rooyah on the
evening of the 15th of April, we encamped about two miles from the
place, and a number of our dead were left in the ditch, mostly
Forty-Second and Sikhs; and, so far as I am aware, no attempt was made
to invest the fort or to keep the enemy in.They took advantage of this
to retreat during the night; but this they did leisurely, burning their
own dead, and stripping and mutilating those of our force that were
abandoned in the ditch.It was reported in the camp that Colonel Haggard
of the Ninth Lancers, commanding the cavalry brigade, had proposed to
invest the place, but was not allowed to do so by General Walpole, who
was said to have acted in such a pig-headed manner that the officers
considered him insane.Rumour added that when Colonel Haggard and a
squadron of the Lancers went to reconnoitre the place on the morning of
the 16th, it was found empty; and that when Colonel Haggard sent an
aide-de-camp to report this fact to the general, he had replied, "Thank
God!"appearing glad that Raja Nirput Singh and his force had slipped
through his fingers after beating back the best-equipped movable column
in India.These reports gaining currency in the camp made the general
still more unpopular, because, in addition to his incapability as an
officer, the men put him down as a coward.During the day the mutilated bodies of our men were recovered from the
ditch.The Sikhs burnt theirs, while a large fatigue party of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third was employed digging one long grave in a
_tope_ of trees not far from the camp.About four o'clock in the
afternoon the funeral took place, Brigadier Hope and the officers on
the right, wrapped in their tartan plaids, the non-commissioned officers
and the privates on their left, each sewn up in a blanket.Cowie, whom we of the Ninety-Third had nicknamed "the Fighting Padre,"
afterwards Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Rev.Ross,
chaplain of the Forty-Second, conducted the service, Mr.Ross reading
the ninetieth Psalm and Mr.The pipers of
the Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, with muffled drums, played _The
Flowers of the Forest_ as a dead march.In all my experience in the army
or out of it I never witnessed such intense grief, both among officers
and men, as was expressed at this funeral.Many of all ranks sobbed like
tender-hearted women.I especially remember our surgeon, "kind-hearted
Billy Munro" as the men called him; also Lieutenants Archie Butter and
Dick Cunningham, who were aides-de-camp to Adrian Hope.Cunningham had
rejoined the regiment after recovery from his wounds at Kudjwa in
October, 1857, but they had left him too lame to march, and he was a
supernumerary aide-de-camp to Brigadier Hope; he and Butter were both
alongside the brigadier, I believe, when he was struck down by the
renegade ruffian.We halted during the 17th, and strong fatigue-parties were employed with
the engineers destroying the fort by blowing up the gateways.The place
was ever after known in the Ninety-Third as "Walpole's Castle."On the
18th we marched, and on the 22nd we came upon the retreating rebels at
a place called Sirsa, on the Ramgunga.The Ninth Lancers and
Horse-Artillery and two companies of the Ninety-Third (I forget their
numbers) crossed the Ramgunga by a ford and intercepted the retreat of a
large number of the enemy, who were escaping by a bridge of boats, the
material for which the country people had collected for them.But their
retreat was now completely cut off, and about three hundred of them were
reported either killed or drowned in the Ramgunga.a tremendous sandstorm, with thunder, and rain in
torrents, came on.The Ramgunga became so swollen that it was impossible
for the detachment of the Ninety-Third to recross, and they bivouacked
in a deserted village on the opposite side, without tents, the officers
hailing across that they could make themselves very comfortable for the
night if they could only get some tea and sugar, as the men had
biscuits, and they had secured a quantity of flour and some goats in the
village.But the boats which the enemy had collected had all broken
adrift, and there was apparently no possibility of sending anything
across to our comrades.This dilemma evoked an act of real cool pluck on
the part of our commissariat _gomashta_,[44] _baboo_ Hera Lall
Chatterjee, whom I have before mentioned in my seventh chapter in
reference to the plunder of a cartload of biscuits at Bunnee bridge on
the retreat from Lucknow.By this time Hera Lall had become better
acquainted with the "wild Highlanders," and was even ready to risk his
life to carry a ration of tea and sugar to them.This he made into a
bundle, which he tied on the crown of his head, and although several of
the officers tried to dissuade him from the attempt, he tightened his
_chudder_[45] round his waist, and declaring that he had often swum the
Hooghly, and that the Ramgunga should not deprive the officers and men
of a detachment of his regiment of their tea, he plunged into the river,
and safely reached the other side with his precious freight on his head!This little incident was never forgotten in the regiment so long as Hera
Lall remained the commissariat _gomashta_ of the Ninety-Third.He was
then a young man, certainly not more than twenty.Although thirty-five
more years of rough-and-tumble life have now considerably grizzled his
appearance, he must often look back with pride to that stormy April
evening in 1858, when he risked his life in the Ramgunga to carry a
tin-pot of tea to the British soldiers.Among the enemy killed that day were several wearing the uniforms
stripped from the dead of the Forty-Second in the ditch of Rooyah; so,
of course, we concluded that this was Nirput Singh's force, and the
defeat and capture of its guns in some measure, I have no doubt,
re-established General Walpole in the good opinion of the authorities,
but not much in that of the force under his command.Nothing else of consequence occurred till about the 27th of April, when
our force rejoined the Commander-in-Chief's column, which had advanced
_via_ Futtehghur, and we heard that Sir William Peel had died of
smallpox at Cawnpore on his way to Calcutta.The news went through the
camp from regiment to regiment, and caused almost as much sorrow in the
Ninety-Third as the death of poor Adrian Hope.FOOTNOTES:

BATTLE OF BAREILLY--GHAZIS--A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--HALT AT BAREILLY
--ACTIONS OF POSGAON, RUSSOOLPORE, AND NOWRUNGABAD--REST AT LAST!The heat was now very oppressive, and we had many men struck down by the
sun every day.We reached Shahjehanpore on the 30th of April, and found
that every building in the cantonments fit for sheltering European
troops had been destroyed by order of the Nana Sahib, who, however, did
not himself wait for our arrival.Strange to say, the bridge of boats
across the Ramgunga was not destroyed, and some of the buildings in the
jail, and the wall round it, were still standing.Colonel Hale and a
wing of the Eighty-Second were left here with some guns, to make the
best of their position in the jail, which partly dominated the city.The
Shahjehanpore distillery was mostly destroyed, but the native distillers
had been working it, and there was a large quantity of rum still in the
vats, which was found to be good and was consequently annexed by the
commissariat.On the 2nd of May we left Shahjehanpore _en route_ for Bareilly, and on
the next day reached Futtehgunge Every village was totally deserted,
but no plundering was allowed, and any camp-followers found marauding
were soon tied up by the provost-marshal's staff.Proclamations were
sent everywhere for the people to remain in their villages, but without
any effect.Two days later we reached Furreedpore, which we also found
deserted, but with evident signs that the enemy were near; and our
bazaars were full of reports of the great strength of the army of Khan
Bahadoor Khan and Feroze Shah.The usual estimate was thirty thousand
infantry, twenty-five thousand cavalry, and about three hundred guns,
among which was said to be a famous black battery that had beaten the
European artillery at ball-practice a few months before they mutinied at
Meerut.The left wing of the Ninety-Third was thrown out, with a
squadron of the Lancers and Tombs' battery, as the advance piquet.As
darkness set in we could see the fires of the enemy's outposts, their
patrol advancing quite close to our sentries during the night, but
making no attack.on the 5th of May, according to Sir Colin's usual
plan, three days' rations were served out, and the whole force was under
arms and slowly advancing before daylight.By sunrise we could see the
enemy drawn up on the plain some five miles from Bareilly, in front of
what had been the native lines; but as we advanced, they retired.By
noon we had crossed the nullah in front of the old cantonments, and,
except by sending round-shot among us at long distances, which did not
do much harm, the enemy did not dispute our advance.We were halted in
the middle of a bare, sandy plain, and we of the rank and file then got
to understand why the enemy were apparently in some confusion; we could
hear the guns of Brigadier Jones ("Jones the Avenger" as he was called)
hammering at them on the other side.The Ninety-Third formed the extreme
right of the front line of infantry with a squadron of the Lancers and
Tombs' battery of horse-artillery.The heat was intense, and when about
two o'clock a movement in the mango _topes_ in our front caused the
order to stand to our arms, it attained such a pitch that the barrels of
our rifles could not be touched by our bare hands!The Sikhs and our light company advanced in skirmishing order, when some
seven to eight hundred matchlock-men opened fire on them, and all at
once a most furious charge was made by a body of about three hundred and
sixty Rohilla Ghazis, who rushed out, shouting "_Bismillah!Deen!_" Sir Colin was close by, and called out, "Ghazis,
Ghazis!However, they
inclined to our left, and only a few came on to the Ninety-Third, and
these were mostly bayoneted by the light company which was extended in
front of the line.The main body rushed on the centre of the
Forty-Second; but as soon as he saw them change their direction Sir
Colin galloped on, shouting out, "Close up, Forty-Second!But that was not so easily done; the Ghazis charged in
blind fury, with their round shields on their left arms, their bodies
bent low, waving their _tulwars_ over their heads, throwing themselves
under the bayonets, and cutting at the men's legs.Colonel Cameron, of
the Forty-Second, was pulled from his horse by a Ghazi, who leaped up
and seized him by the collar while he was engaged with another on the
opposite side; but his life was saved by Colour-Sergeant Gardener, who
seized one of the enemy's _tulwars_, and rushing to the colonel's
assistance cut off the Ghazi's head.General Walpole was also pulled off
his horse and received two sword-cuts, but was rescued by the bayonets
of the Forty-Second.The struggle was short, but every one of the Ghazis
was killed.None attempted to escape; they had evidently come on to kill
or be killed, and a hundred and thirty-three lay in one circle right in
front of the colours of the Forty-Second.The Commander-in-Chief himself saw one of the Ghazis, who had broken
through the line, lying down, shamming dead.Sir Colin caught the glance
of his eye, saw through the ruse, and called to one of the Forty-Second,
"Bayonet that man!"But the Ghazi was enveloped in a thick quilted tunic
of green silk, through which the blunt Enfield bayonet would not pass,
and the Highlander was in danger of being cut down, when a Sikh
_sirdar_[46] of the Fourth Punjabis rushed to his assistance, and took
the Ghazi's head clean off with one sweep of his keen _tulwar_.These
Ghazis, with a very few exceptions, were gray-bearded men of the Rohilla
race, clad in green, with green turbans and _kummerbunds_,[47] round
shields on the left arm, and curved _tulwars_ that would split a hair.They only succeeded in wounding about twenty men--they threw themselves
so wildly on the bayonets of the Forty-Second!One of them, an exception
to the majority, was quite a youth, and having got separated from the
rest challenged the whole of the line to come out and fight him.Joiner, the quartermaster of the Ninety-Third, firing his
carbine, but missing.Joiner returned the fire with his revolver,
and the Ghazi then threw away his carbine and rushed at Joiner with his
_tulwar_.Some of the light company tried to take the youngster
prisoner, but it was no use; he cut at every one so madly, that they had
to bayonet him.The commotion caused by this attack was barely over, when word was
passed that the enemy were concentrating in front for another rush, and
the order was given for the spare ammunition to be brought to the front.I was detached with about a dozen men of No.7 company to find the
ammunition-guard, and bring our ammunition in rear of the line.Just as
I reached the ammunition-camels, a large force of the rebel cavalry, led
by Feroze Shah in person, swept round the flank and among the baggage,
cutting down camels, camel-drivers, and camp-followers in all
directions.My detachment united with the ammunition-guard and defended
ourselves, shooting down a number of the enemy's _sowars_.Ross, chaplain of the Forty-Second, running for his life,
dodging round camels and bullocks with a rebel _sowar_ after him, till,
seeing our detachment, he rushed to us for protection, calling out,
"Ninety-Third, shoot that impertinent fellow!"Bob Johnston, of my
company, shot the _sowar_ down.Ross had no sword nor revolver, and
not even a stick with which to defend himself.Moral--When in the field,
_padres_, carry a good revolver!Ross gained
our protection, we saw Mr.Russell, of _The Times_, who was ill and
unable to walk from the kick of a horse, trying to escape on horseback.He had got out of his _dooly_, undressed and bareheaded as he was, and
leaped into the saddle, as the _syce_ had been leading his horse near
him.Several of the enemy's _sowars_ were dodging through the camels to
get at him.We turned our rifles on them, and I shot down the one
nearest to Mr.Russell, just as he had cut down an intervening
camel-driver and was making for "Our Special"; in fact, his _tulwar_ was
actually lifted to swoop down on Mr.Russell's bare head when my bullet
put a stop to his proceedings.Russell tumble from his saddle
at the same instant as the _sowar_ fell, and I got a rare fright, for I
thought my bullet must have struck both.Russell had fallen, and I then saw from the position of the slain
_sowar_ that my bullet had found its proper billet, and that Mr.Russell
was down with sunstroke, the blood flowing freely from his nose.Our Mooltanee Irregulars were after the enemy, and
I had to hasten to the line with the spare ammunition; but before I left
Mr.Russell to his fate, I called some of the Forty-Second
baggage-guards to put him into his _dooly_ and take him to their doctor,
while I hastened back to the line and reported the occurrence to Captain
Dawson.Next morning I was glad to hear that Mr.Russell was still
alive, and likely to get over his stroke.After this charge of the rebel cavalry we were advanced; but the thunder
of Jones' attack on the other side of the city evidently disconcerted
the enemy, and they made off to the right of our line, while large
numbers of Ghazis concentrated themselves in the main buildings of the
city.We suffered more from the sun than from the enemy; and after we
advanced into the shelter of a large mango _tope_ we were nearly eaten
alive by swarms of small green insects, which invaded our bare legs in
thousands, till we were glad to leave the shelter of the mango trees and
take to the open plain again.As night drew on the cantonments were
secured, the baggage was collected, and we bivouacked on the plain,
strong piquets being thrown out.My company was posted in a small field
of onions near a _pucca_[48] well with a Persian wheel for lifting the
water.We supped off the biscuits in our haversacks, raw onions, and the
cool water drawn from well, and then went off to sleep.I wish I might
always sleep as soundly as I did that night after my supper of raw
onions and dry biscuits!On the 6th of May the troops were under arms, and advanced on the city
of Bareilly.But little opposition was offered, except from one large
house on the outskirts of the town, in which a body of about fifty
Rohilla Ghazis had barricaded themselves, and a company (I think it was
No.6 of the Ninety-Third) was sent to storm the house, after several
shells had been pitched into it.This was done without much loss, except
that of one man; I now forget his name, but think it was William
MacDonald.He rushed into a room full of Ghazis, who, before his
comrades could get to his assistance, had cut him into sixteen pieces
with their sharp _tulwars_!As the natives said, he was cut into
annas.[49] But the house was taken, and the whole of the Ghazis slain,
with only the loss of this one man killed and about half a dozen
wounded.While this house was being stormed the townspeople sent a deputation of
submission to the Commander-in-Chief, and by ten o'clock we had pitched
our camp near the ruins of the church which had been destroyed twelve
months before.Khan Bahadoor Khan and the Nana Sahib were reported to
have fled in the direction of the Nepal Terai, while Feroze Shah, with a
force of cavalry and guns, had gone back to attack Shahjehanpore.About mid-day on the 6th a frightful accident happened, by which a large
number of camp-followers and cattle belonging to the ordnance-park were
killed.Whether for concealment or by design (it was never known which)
the enemy had left a very large quantity of gunpowder and loaded shells
in a dry well under a huge tree in the centre of the old cantonment.The
well had been filled to the very mouth with powder and shells, and then
covered with a thin layer of dry sand.A large number of ordnance
_khalasies_,[50] bullock-drivers, and _dooly_-bearers had congregated
under the tree to cook their mid-day meal, lighting their fires right on
the top of this powder-magazine, when it suddenly exploded with a most
terrific report, shaking the ground for miles, making the tent-pegs fly
out of the hard earth, and throwing down tents more than a mile from the
spot.I was lying down in a tent at the time, and the concussion was so
great that I felt as if lifted clear off the ground.The tent-pegs flew
out all round, and down came the tents, before the men, many of whom
were asleep, had time to get clear of the canvas.By the time we got our
arms free of the tents, bugles were sounding the assembly in all
directions, and staff-officers galloping over the plain to ascertain
what had happened.The spot where the accident had occurred was easily
found.The powder having been in a deep well, it acted like a huge
mortar, fired perpendicularly; an immense cloud of black smoke was sent
up in a vertical column at least a thousand yards high, and thousands of
shells were bursting in it, the fragments flying all round in a circle
of several hundred yards.As the place was not far from the
ammunition-park, the first idea was that the enemy had succeeded in
blowing up the ammunition; but those who had ever witnessed a similar
accident could see that, whatever had happened, the concussion was too
great to be caused by only one or two waggon-loads of powder.From the
appearance of the column of smoke and the shells bursting in it, as if
shot out of a huge mortar, it was evident that the accident was confined
to one small spot, and the belief became general that the enemy had
exploded an enormous mine.But after some time the truth became known,
the troops were dispersed, and the tents repitched.This explosion was
followed in the afternoon by a most terrific thunderstorm and heavy
rain, which nearly washed away the camp.The storm came on as the
non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third and No.2 company were
falling in to bury Colour-Sergeant Mackie, who had been knocked down by
the sun the day before and had died that forenoon.Just when we were
lowering the body into the grave, there was a crash of thunder almost as
loud as the explosion of the powder-mine.The ground becoming soaked
with rain, the tent-pegs drew and many tents were again thrown down by
the force of the hurricane; and as everything we had became soaked, we
passed a most uncomfortable night.On the morning of the 7th of May we heard that Colonel Hale and the wing
of the Eighty-Second left in the jail at Shahjehanpore had been attacked
by Feroze Shah and the Nana Sahib, and were sore pushed to defend
themselves.A brigade, consisting of the Sixtieth Rifles, Seventy-Ninth
Highlanders, several native regiments, the Ninth Lancers, and some
batteries of artillery, under Brigadier John Jones ("the Avenger") was
at once started back for the relief of Shahjehanpore--rather a gloomy
outlook for the hot weather of 1858!While this brigade was starting,
the remainder of the force which was to hold Bareilly for the hot
season, consisting of the Forty-Second, Seventy-Eighth, and
Ninety-Third, shifted camp to the sandy plain near where Bareilly
railway station now stands, hard by the little fort in the centre of the
plain.There we remained in tents during the whole of May, large working
parties being formed every morning to assist the engineers to get what
shelter was possible ready for the hottest months.The district jail was
arranged as barracks for the Ninety-Third, and we moved into them on the
1st of June.The Forty-Second got the old _cutchery_[51] buildings with
a new thatch roof; and the Seventy-Eighth had the Bareilly College.I omitted to mention in its proper place that on the death of Adrian
Hope, Colonel A. S. Leith-Hay, of the Ninety-Third, succeeded to the
command of the brigade, and Major W. G. A. Middleton got command of the
regiment till we rejoined the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found that
Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, who had exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel C.
Gordon, had arrived from England and taken command before we retook
Bareilly.We remained in Bareilly from May till October in comparative peace.We
had one or two false alarms, and a wing of the Forty-Second, with some
cavalry and artillery, went out about the beginning of June to disperse
a body of rebels who were threatening an attack on Moradabad.These reminiscences do not, as I have before remarked, profess to be a
history of the Mutiny except in so far as I saw it from the ranks of the
Ninety-Third.But I may correct historical mistakes when I find them,
and in vol.500, of _The Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery
Martin, the following statement occurs: "Khan Bahadoor Khan, of
Bareilly, held out in the Terai until the close of 1859; and then,
hemmed in by the Goorkhas on one side and the British forces on the
other, was captured by Jung Bahadoor.The Khan is described as an old
man, with a long white beard, bent almost double with rheumatic fever.His life is considered forfeited by his alleged complicity in the
Bareilly murders, but his sentence is not yet pronounced."Khan Bahadoor Khan was captured by the Bareilly
police-levy early in July, 1858, and was hanged in my presence in front
of the _kotwalee_ in Bareilly a few days after his capture.He was an
old man with a long white beard, but not at all bent with age, and there
was certainly no want of proof of his complicity in the Bareilly
murders.Next to the Nana Sahib he was one of the most active
instigators of murder in the rebel ranks.He was a retired judge of the
Company's service, claiming descent from the ancient rulers of
Rohilcund, whom the English, in the time of Warren Hastings, had
assisted the Nawab of Lucknow to put down in the Rohilla war.His
capture was effected in the following manner:--Colonel W. C. M'Donald,
of the Ninety-Third, was on the staff in the Crimea, and he had in his
employ a man named Tahir Beg who was a sort of confidential interpreter.Whether this man was Turkish, Armenian, or Bulgarian I don't know, but
this much I do know; among Mahommedans Tahir Beg was a strict Mussulman,
among Bulgarians he was a Roman Catholic, and in the Ninety-Third he had
no objections to be a Presbyterian.He was a good linguist, speaking
English, French, and Turkish, as well as most of the vernaculars of Asia
Minor; and when the Crimean war was over, he accompanied Major M'Donald
to England in the capacity of an ordinary servant.In 1857, when the
expedition under Lord Elgin was being got ready for China, Colonel
M'Donald was appointed quarter-master-general, and started for Canton
taking Tahir Beg with him as a servant; but, the expedition to China
having been diverted for the suppression of the Mutiny, M'Donald
rejoined the regiment with Tahir Beg still with him in the same
capacity.From his knowledge of Turkish and Persian Tahir Beg soon made
himself master of Hindoostanee, and he lived in the regimental bazaar
with the Mahommedan shopkeepers, among whom he professed himself a
strict follower of the Prophet.After he became pretty well conversant
with the language, it was reported that he gained much valuable
information for the authorities.When Bareilly was recaptured
arrangements were made for the enlistment of a police-levy, and Tahir
Beg got the appointment of city _kotwal_[52] and did valuable service by
hunting out a great number of leading rebels.It was Tahir Beg who heard
that Khan Bahadoor Khan had returned to the vicinity of Bareilly with
only a small body of followers; and he arranged for his capture, and
brought him in a prisoner to the guard-room of the Ninety-Third.Khan
Bahadoor Khan was put through a brief form of trial by the civil power,
and was found guilty of rebellion and murder upon both native and
European evidence.By that time several Europeans who had managed to
escape to Naini Tal on the outbreak of the Mutiny through the favour of
the late Raja of Rampore, had returned; so there was no doubt of the
prisoner's guilt.I must mention another incident that happened in Bareilly.Among the
gentlemen who returned from Naini Tal, was one whose brother had been
shot by his bearer, his most trusted servant.This ruffian turned out to
be no other than the very man who had denounced Jamie Green as a spy.It
was either early in August or at the end of July that a strange European
gentleman, while passing through the regimental bazaar of the
Ninety-Third, noticed an officer's servant, who was a most devout
Christian, could speak English, and was a regular attendant at all
soldiers' evening services with the regimental chaplain.The gentleman
(I now forget his name) laid hold of our devout Christian brother in the
bazaar, and made him over to the nearest European guard, when he was
tried and found guilty of the murder of a whole family of
Europeans--husband, wife, and children--in May, 1857.There was no want
of evidence, both European and native, against him.Thus was the death
of the unfortunate Jamie Green avenged.I may add a rather amusing
incident about this man.His master evidently believed that this was a
case of mistaken identity, and went to see the brigadier, Colonel A. S.
Leith-Hay, on behalf of his servant.But it turned out that the man had
joined the British camp at Futtehghur in the preceding January, and
Colonel Leith-Hay was the first with whom he had taken service and
consequently knew the fellow.However, the brigadier listened to what
the accused's master had to urge until he mentioned that the man was a
most devout Christian, and read the Bible morning and evening.On this
Colonel Leith-Hay could listen to the argument no longer, but shouted
out:--"He a Christian!He's no more a
Christian than I am!He served me for one month, and robbed me of more
than ten times his pay.So he was made over to the
civil commissioner, tried, found guilty, and hanged.About the end of September the
weather was comparatively cool.Many people had returned from Naini Tal
to look after their wrecked property.General Colin Troup with the
Sixty-Sixth Regiment of Goorkhas had come down from Kumaon, and
soldiers' sports were got up for the amusement of the troops and
visitors.Among the latter was the loyal Raja of Rampore, who presented
a thousand rupees for prizes for the games and five thousand for a
dinner to all the troops in the garrison.At these games the
Ninety-Third carried off all the first prizes for putting the shot,
throwing the hammer, and tossing the caber.Our best athlete was a man
named George Bell, of the grenadier company, the most powerful man in
the British army.Before the regiment left England Bell had beaten all
comers at all the athletic games throughout Scotland.He stood about six
feet four inches, and was built in proportion, most remarkably active
for his size both in running and leaping, and also renowned for feats of
strength.There was a young lad of the band named Murdoch MacKay, the
smallest boy in the regiment, but a splendid dancer; and the two, "the
giant and the pigmy," as they were called, attended all the athletic
games throughout Scotland from Edinburgh to Inverness, always returning
covered with medals.I mention all this because the Bareilly sports
proved the last to poor George Bell.An enormous caber having been cut,
and all the leading men (among them some very powerful artillerymen) of
the brigade had tried to toss it and failed.The brigadier then ordered
three feet to be cut from it, expressing his opinion that there was not
a man in the British army who could toss it.On this George Bell stepped
into the arena, and said he would take a turn at it before it was cut;
he put the huge caber on his shoulders, balanced it, and tossed it clean
over.While the caber was being cut for the others, Bell ran in a
hundred yards' race, which he also won; but he came in with his mouth
full of blood.He had, through over-exertion, burst a blood-vessel in
his lungs.He slowly bled to death and died about a fortnight after we
left Bareilly, and lies buried under a large tree in the jungles of Oude
between Fort Mithowlie and the banks of the Gogra.Bell was considered
an ornament to, and the pride of, the regiment, and his death was
mourned by every officer and man in it, and by none more than by our
popular doctor, Billy Munro, who did everything that a physician could
do to try and stop the bleeding; but without success.We left Bareilly on the 10th of October, and marched to Shahjehanpore,
where we were joined by a battalion of the Sixtieth Rifles, the
Sixty-Sixth Goorkhas, some of the Sixth Carabineers, Tomb's troop of
horse-artillery, and a small train of heavy guns and mortars.On the
17th of October we had our first brush with the enemy at the village of
Posgaon, about twenty miles from Shahjehanpore.Here they were strong in
cavalry, and tried the Bareilly game of getting round the flanks and
cutting up our camp-followers.But a number of them got hemmed in
between the ammunition-guard and the main line, and Cureton's Mooltanee
cavalry, coming round on them from both flanks, cut down about fifty of
them, capturing their horses.In the midst of this scrimmage two of the
enemy, getting among the baggage-guard, were taken for two of our native
cavalry, till at length they separated from the main body and got
alongside of a man who was some distance away.One of them called to the
poor fellow to look in another direction, when the second one cut his
head clean off, leaped from his horse, and, lifting the head, sprang
into his saddle and was off like the wind!Many rifle-bullets were sent
after him, but he got clear away, carrying the head with him.The next encounter we had was at Russoolpore, and then at Nowrungabad,
where the Queen's proclamation, transferring the government from the
Company to the Crown, was read.After this all our tents were sent into
Mahomdee, and we took to the jungles without tents or baggage, merely a
greatcoat and a blanket; and thus we remained till after the taking of
Mithowlie.We then returned to Sitapore, where we got our tents again
the day before Christmas, 1858; and by the new year we were on the banks
of the Gogra, miles from any village.The river swarmed with alligators
of enormous size, and the jungles with wild pig and every variety of
game, and scarcely a day passed without our seeing tigers, wolves, and
hyaenas.We remained in those jungles
across the Gogra, in sight of the Nepaul hills, till about the end of
February, by which time thousands of the rebels had tendered their
submission and returned to their homes.The Ninety-Third then got the
route for Subathoo, in the Himalayas near Simla.Leaving the jungles of
Oude, we marched _via_ Shahjehanpore, Bareilly, Moradabad, and thence by
the foot of the hills till we came into civilised regions at
Saharunpore; thence to Umballa, reaching Subathoo about the middle of
April with our clothes completely in rags.We had received no new
clothing since we had arrived in India, and our kilts were torn into
ribbons.But the men were in splendid condition, and could have marched
thirty miles a day without feeling fatigued, if our baggage-animals
could have kept up with us.On our march out from Kalka, the
Commander-in-Chief passed us on his way to Simla.This ended the work of the old Ninety-Third Sutherland Highlanders in
the Mutiny, and here, for the present, I will end my reminiscences.FOOTNOTES:

THE HISTORY OF THE MURDER OF MAJOR NEILL AT AUGUR IN 1887


I will relate an incident of an unusual kind, told to me by a man whom I
met in Jhansi, which has reference to the executions ordered by General
Neill at Cawnpore in July and August, 1857.But before I do so I may
mention that in Cawnpore, Jhansi, and Lucknow I found the natives very
unwilling to enter into conversation or to give any information about
the events of that year.In this statement I don't include the natives
of the class who acted as guides, etc., or those who were in the service
of Government at the time._They_ were ready enough to talk; but as a
rule I knew as much myself as they could tell me.Those whom I found
suspicious of my motives and unwilling to talk, were men who must have
been on the side of the rebels against us.I looked out for such, and
met many who had evidently served as soldiers, and who admitted that
they had been in the army before 1857; but when I tried to get them to
speak about the Mutiny, as a rule they pretended to have been so young
that they had forgotten all about it,--generally a palpable falsehood,
judging from their personal appearance,--or they professed to have been
absent in their villages and to know nothing about the events happening
in the great centres of the rebellion.The impression left on my mind
was that they were either afraid or ashamed to talk about the Mutiny.In the second chapter of these reminiscences it may be remembered I
asked if any reader could let me know whether Major A. H. S. Neill,
commanding the Second Regiment Central India Horse, who was shot on
parade by Sowar Mazar Ali at Augur, Central India, on the 14th March,
1887, was a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame.The information has
not been forthcoming[53]; and for want of it I cannot corroborate the
following statement in a very strange story.In 1892 I passed two days at Jhansi, having been obliged to wait because
the gentleman whom I had gone to see on business was absent from the
station; and I went all over the city to try and pick up information
regarding the Mutiny.I eventually came across a man who, by his
military salute, I could see had served in the army, and I entered into
conversation with him.At first he pretended that his connection with the army had merely been
that of an armourer-_mistree_[54] of several European regiments; and he
told me that he had served in the armourer's shop of the Ninety-Third
when they were in Jhansi twenty-four years ago, in 1868 and 1869.After
I had informed him that the Ninety-Third was my regiment, he appeared to
be less reticent; and at length he admitted that he had been an armourer
in the service of Scindia before the Mutiny, and that he was in Cawnpore
when the Mutiny broke out, and also when the city was retaken by
Generals Havelock and Neill.After a long conversation he appeared to be convinced that I had no evil
intentions, but was merely anxious to collect reliable evidence
regarding events which, even now, are but slightly known.Amongst other
matters he told me that the (late) Maharaja Scindia was not by any means
so loyal as the Government believed him to be; that he himself (my
informant) had formed one of a deputation that was sent to Cawnpore from
Gwalior to the Nana Sahib before the outbreak; and that although keeping
in the background, the Maharaja Scindia incited his army to rebellion
and to murder their officers, and himself fled as a pretended fugitive
to Agra to devise means to betray the fort of Agra, should the Gwalior
army, as he anticipated would be the case, prove victorious over the
British.He also told me that the farce played by Scindia about 1874,
viz.the giving up a spurious Nana Sahib, was a prearranged affair
between Scindia and the _fakeer_ who represented the Nana.But, as I
expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, my friend came down to
more recent times, and asked me if I remembered about the murder of
Major Neill at Augur in Central India in 1887, thirty years after the
Mutiny?I told him that I very well remembered reading of the case in
the newspapers of the time.He then asked me if I knew why Major Neill
was murdered?I replied that the published accounts of the murder and
trial were so brief that I had formed the conclusion that something was
concealed from the public, and that I myself was of opinion that a woman
must have been the cause of the murder,--that Major Neill possibly had
been found in some intrigue with one of Mazar Ali's womenkind.To which
he replied that I was quite wrong.He then told me that Major Neill was
a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame, and that Sowar Mazar Ali, who
shot him, was a son of Suffur Ali, _duffadar_ of the Second Regiment
Light Cavalry, who was unjustly accused of having murdered Sir Hugh
Wheeler at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_, and was hanged for the murder by
order of General Neill, after having been flogged by sweepers and made
to lick clean a portion of the blood-stained floor of the
slaughter-house.After the recapture of Cawnpore, Suffur Ali was arrested in the city,
and accused of having cut off General Wheeler's head as he alighted from
his palkee at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ on the 27th of June, 1857.This
he stoutly denied, pleading that he was a loyal servant of the Company
who had been compelled to join in the Mutiny against his will.General
Neill, however, would not believe him, so he was taken to the
slaughter-house and flogged by Major Bruce's sweeper-police till he
cleaned up his spot of blood from the floor of the house where the women
and children were murdered.When about to be hanged Suffur Ali adjured
every Mahommedan in the crowd to have a message sent to Rohtuck, to his
infant son, by name Mazar Ali, to inform him that his father had been
unjustly denied and flogged by sweepers by order of General Neill before
being hanged, and that his dying message to him was that he prayed God
and the Prophet to spare him and strengthen his arm to avenge the death
of his father on General Neill or any of his descendants.My informant went on to tell me that Mazar Ali had served under Major
Neill for years, and had been treated by him with special kindness
before he came to know that the Major was the son of the man who had
ordered his father's execution; that while he was lying ill in hospital
a _fakeer_ one day arrived in the station from some remote quarter of
India, and told him of his father's dying imprecation, and that Major
Neill being the son of General Neill, it was the decree of fate that
Mazar Ali should shoot Major Neill on parade the following day; which he
did, without any apparent motive whatever.I expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, when my informant
told me he could give me a copy of a circular, printed in Oordoo and
English, given to the descendants of Suffur Ali, directing them, as a
message from the other world, to avenge the death and defilement of
their father.The man eventually brought the leaflet to me in the _dak_
bungalow in Jhansi.The circular is in both Oordoo and English, and
printed in clean, clear type; but so far as I can read it, the English
translation, which is printed on the leaflet beneath the Oordoo, and a
copy of which I reproduce below, does not strike me as a literal
translation of the Oordoo.The latter seems to me to be couched in
language calculated to prove a much stronger incitement to murder than
the English version would imply.However, the following is the English
version _verbatim_, as it appears on the leaflet, word for word and
point for point, italics and all._The imprecation, vociferated by_ SUFFUR ALI,
      _Duffadar 2nd Regiment Light Cavalry, who was executed at
      the Slaughter-house, on the 25th July, 1857, for killing_
      SIR HUGH WHEELER, _at the Suttechoura Ghat_.be pleased to receive into Paradise the
      soul of your humble servant, whose body Major Bruce's Mehtur
      police are now defiling by lashes, forced to lick a space of
      the blood-stained floor of the Slaughter-house, and
      hereafter to be hanged, by the order of General Neill.And,
      oh Prophet!in due time inspire my infant son Mazar Ali of
      Rohtuck, that he may revenge this desecration on the General
      and his descendants._Take notice!_--Mazar Ali, Sowar, 2nd Regiment, Central
      India Horse, who under divine mission, shot Major A. H. S.
      Neill, Commanding the Corps, at Augur, Central India, on the
      14th March 1887, was sentenced to death by Sir Lepel
      Griffin, Governor-General's Agent.The Oordoo in the circular is printed in the Persian character without
the vowel-points, and as I have not read much Oordoo since I passed my
Hindoostanee examination thirty-three years ago, I have had some
difficulty in translating the leaflet, especially as it is without the
vowel-points.The man who gave it to me asked if I knew anything about
the family of General Neill, and I replied that I did not, which was the
truth.When I asked why he wanted to know, he said that if any more of
his sons were still in India, their lives would soon be taken by the
descendants of men who were defiled and hanged at Cawnpore under the
brigade-order of General Neill, dated Cawnpore, 25th of July, 1857.This
is the order to which I have alluded in the second chapter of my
reminiscences, and which remained in force till the arrival of Sir Colin
Campbell at Cawnpore in the following November.As I had never seen a
copy of it, having only heard of it, I asked my informant how he knew
about it.He told me that thousands of copies, in English, Oordoo, and
Hindee, were in circulation in the bazaars of Upper India.I told my
friend that I should very much like to see a copy, and he promised to
bring me one.Shortly after he left me in the _dak_ bungalow,
undertaking to return with a copy of the order, as also numerous
proclamations from the English Government, and the counter-proclamations
on the part of the leaders of the rebellion.I thought that here I had
struck a rich historical mine; but my friend did not turn up again!I
sat up waiting for him till long after midnight, and as he did not
return I went into the city again the following day to the place where I
had met him; but all the people around pretended to know nothing
whatever about the man, and I saw no more of him.However, I was glad to
have got the leaflet _re_ the assassination of Major Neill, because
several gentlemen have remarked, since I commenced my reminiscences,
that I mention so many incidents not generally known, that many are
inclined to believe that I am inventing history rather than relating
facts.But that is not so; and, besides what I have related, I could
give hundreds of most interesting incidents that are not generally known
nor ever will be known.[55]

Now, in my humble opinion, is the time that a history of the real facts
and causes of the Mutiny should be written, if a competent man could
devote the time to do so, and to visit the centres of the rebellion and
get those who took part in the great uprising against the rule of the
Feringhee to come forward, with full confidence of safety, and relate
all they know about the affair.Thousands of facts would come to light
which would be of immense historical importance, as also of great
political value to Government, facts that in a few years will become
lost to the world, or be remembered only as traditions of 1857.But the
man who is to undertake the work must be one with a thorough knowledge
of the native character and languages, a man of broad views, and, above
all, one who would, to a certain extent, sympathise with the natives,
and inspire them with confidence and enlist their assistance.As a rule,
the Englishman, the Government official, the _Sahib Bahadoor_, although
respected, is at the same time too much feared, and the truth would be
more or less concealed from him.I formed this opinion when I heard of
the circumstances which are supposed to have led to the assassination of
Major Neill.If true, we have here secret incitement to murder handed
down for generations, and our Government, with its extensive police and
its Thuggee Department, knowing nothing about it![56]

FOOTNOTES:

[53] Major Neill _was_ a son of Brigadier-General Neill commanding at
Cawnpore during the first relief of Lucknow.General Neill went to the
front as colonel commanding the First Madras Fusiliers.[54] Workman; in this case a blacksmith.[55] "Some of the incidents related by Mr.Forbes-Mitchell, and now for
the first time brought to light in his most interesting series of
Reminiscences, are of so sensational an order that we are not surprised
that many persons to whom the narrator is a stranger should regard them
with a certain incredulity.We may take this opportunity therefore of
stating that, so far as it is possible at this date to corroborate
incidents that occurred thirty-five years ago, Mr.Forbes-Mitchell has
afforded us ample proof of the accuracy of his memory and the general
correctness of his facts.In the case under notice, we have been shown
the leaflet in which Mazar Ali's cold-blooded murder of his commanding
officer is vindicated, and of which the English translation above given
is an exact reproduction.The leaflet bears no evidence whatever to
disclose its origin, but we see no reason to doubt that, as Mr.Forbes-Mitchell's informant declared, it was widely circulated in the
bazaars of Upper India shortly after Mazar Ali paid the penalty of his
crime with his own life."--ED._Calcutta Statesman._

[56] The _vendetta_ is such a well-known institution among the Pathans,
that no further explanation of Major Neill's murder by the son of a man
who was executed by the Major's father's orders is necessary.APPENDIX B

EUROPEANS AMONG THE REBELS


Although recollections of the Mutiny are fast being obliterated by the
kindly hand of time, there must still be many readers who will remember
the reports current in the newspapers of the time, and elsewhere in 1857
and 1858, of Europeans being seen in the ranks of the rebels.In a
history of _The Siege of Delhi, by an Officer who served there_ (name
not given), published by Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1861, the
following passages occur.After describing the battle of
Budlee-ke-Serai, the writer goes on to say: "The brave old Afghan chief,
Jan Fishan Khan,[57] who with some horsemen had followed our star from
Meerut, was heard crying out, his stout heart big with the enthusiasm of
the moment: 'Another such day, and I shall become a Christian!'"And in
his comments on this the writer says: "And sad to tell, a European
deserter from Meerut had been struck down fighting in the sepoy ranks,
and was recognised by his former comrades."After describing the opening
of the siege and the general contempt which the Europeans had for the
enemy's artillery, the writer states that the tone of conversation in
the camp was soon changed, and "From being an object of contempt, their
skill became one of wonder and admiration, perhaps too great.Some
artillery officers protested that their practice was better than our
own.Many believed that their fire was under the superintendence of
Europeans.Two men with solar helmets could be seen, by the help of our
best glasses, in their batteries, but no one who knew how much of the
work in India was really done by natives, wondered at the practical
skill they now showed."Turning from Delhi to Lucknow, many will
remember the account of the disastrous action at Chinhut by Mr.He
says: "The masses of the rebel cavalry by which the British were
outflanked near the Kookrail bridge, were apparently commanded by some
European who was seen waving his sword and attempting to make his men
follow him and dash at ours.He was a handsome-looking man, well-built,
fair, about twenty-five years of age, with light moustaches, wearing the
undress uniform of a European cavalry officer, with a blue, gold-laced
cap on his head."Rees suggests the possibility of this person
having been either a Russian or a renegade Christian.The only other case to which I will allude came under my own
observation.I have told in my fourteenth chapter how Brigadier Adrian
Hope was killed in the abortive attack on the fort of Rooyah, by a shot
fired from a high tree inside the fort, and how it was commonly believed
that the man who fired the shot was a European.I myself thought at the
time that such was the case, and now I am convinced of it.I was the
non-commissioned officer of a party of the Ninety-Third sent to cover an
engineer-officer who had either volunteered or been ordered to take a
sketch of one of the fort gates and its approaches, in the hope of being
able to blow it in, and thus gain an entrance to the fort, which was
surrounded by a deep ditch, and inside the ditch an almost impenetrable
belt of prickly bamboos about ten yards in breadth, so interwoven and
full of thorns that a cat could scarcely have passed through it.Under
the guidance of a native of the Intelligence Department, we managed to
advance unseen, and got under cover of a thick clump of bamboos near the
gate.Strict orders had been given that no one on any account whatever
was to speak, much less to fire a shot, unless we should be attacked,
for fear of drawing attention to our proceedings, till the engineer had
had time to make a rough sketch of the position of the gate and its
approaches.During this time we were so close to the fort that we could
hear the enemy talking inside; and the man who was on the tree could be
seen and heard by us quite plainly, calling to the stormers on the other
face in unmistakable barrack-room English: "Come on, you ----
Highlanders!you have a harder nut to crack than eating
oatmeal porridge.If you can come through these bamboos we'll warm your
---- for you, if you come in here!"In short, the person
talking showed such a command of English slang and barrack-room abuse
that it was clear he was no native.Every one of my party was convinced
that the speaker was a European, and if we had been aware at the time
that this man had just killed Brigadier Hope he would certainly have
paid the penalty with his own life; but we knew nothing of this till we
retired, and found that the stormers had been recalled, with the
butcher's bill already given.The events above related had almost passed from my recollection, till
they were recalled by the following circumstance.A vacancy having
occurred among the _durwans_[58] in the factory under my charge, among
several candidates brought by the _jemadar_[59] for the vacant post was
a fine-looking old man, who gave me an unmistakable military salute in
the old style, square from the shoulder--quite different from the
present mongrel German salute, which the English army has taken to
imitating since the Germans beat their old conquerors, the French; I
mean the present mode of saluting with the palm of the hand turned to
the front.As soon as I saw this old man I knew he had been a soldier;
my heart warmed to him at once, and I determined to give him the vacant
appointment.So turning to him I said: "You have served in the army; are
you one of the sepoys of 1857?"He at once admitted that he had formerly
belonged to the Ninth Native Infantry, and that he was present with the
regiment when it mutinied at Allyghur on the 20th of May, 1857.He had
accompanied the regiment to Delhi, and had fought against the English
throughout the siege, and afterwards at Lucknow and throughout the Oude
campaigns."But, _Sahib_" said he, "the Ninth Regiment were almost the
only regiment which did not murder their officers.We gave each of them
three months' pay in advance from the treasury, and escorted them and
their families within a safe distance of Agra before we went to Delhi,
and all of us who lived to come through the Mutiny were pardoned by the
Government."I knew this to be the truth, and ordered the _jemadar_ to
enrol the applicant, by name Doorga, or Doorga Sing, late sepoy of the
Ninth Native Infantry, as one of the factory _durwans_, determining to
have many a talk with him on his experiences of the Mutiny.Many of my readers may recollect that, after escorting their European
officers to the vicinity of Agra, the Ninth Regiment went to Delhi, and
throughout the siege the men of this regiment proved the most daring
opponents of the British Army.According to Mead's _Sepoy Revolt_, "The
dead bodies of men bearing the regimental number of the Ninth Regiment
were found in the front line of every severe engagement around Delhi and
at the deadly Cashmere Gate when it was finally stormed."After engaging
Doorga Sing it was not long before I made him relate his experiences of
the siege of Delhi, and afterwards at Lucknow and in Oude, and one day I
happened to ask him if it was true that there were several Europeans in
the rebel army.He told me that he had heard of several, but that he
personally knew of two only, one of whom accompanied the mutineers from
Meerut and was killed at the battle of Budlee-ke-Serai,--evidently the
deserter alluded to above.The other European was a man of superior
stamp, who came to Delhi from Rohilcund with the Bareilly Brigade, and
the King gave him rank in the rebel army next to General Bukht Khan, the
titular Commander-in-Chief, This European commanded the artillery
throughout the siege of Delhi, as he had formerly been in the Company's
artillery and knew the drill better than any man in the rebel army.I
asked Doorga Sing if he had ever heard his name or what rank he held
before the Mutiny, and he said he had heard his name at the time, but
had forgotten it, and that before the Mutiny he had held the rank of
sergeant-major, but whether in the native artillery or in one of the
native infantry regiments at Bareilly he did not now recollect.But the
Badshah promoted him to be general of artillery immediately on the
arrival of the Bareilly Brigade, and he was by far the bravest and most
energetic commander that the rebels had, and the most esteemed by the
revolted sepoys, whose respect he retained to the last.Even after they
had ceased saluting their native officers they continued to turn out
guards and present arms to the European _sahib_.Throughout the siege of
Delhi there was never a day passed that this man did not visit every
battery, and personally correct the elevation of the guns.He fixed the
sites and superintended the erection of all new batteries to counteract
the fire of the English as the siege advanced.On the day of the
assault, the 14th of September, he fought like _shaitan_,[60] fighting
himself and riding from post to post, trying to rally defeated sepoys,
and bringing up fresh troops to the support of assailed points.Doorga
Sing's company had formed the guard at the Cashmere Gate, and he vividly
described the attack and defence of that post, and how completely the
sepoys were surprised and the powder-bags fixed to the gate before the
sentries of the guard were aware of the advance of the English.After the assault Doorga Sing did not see the European till the beaten
army reached Muttra, when he again found him superintending the
arrangements for crossing the Jumna.About thirty thousand sepoys had
collected there in their retreat from Delhi, a common danger holding
them together, under the command of Bukht Khan and Feroze Shah.But they
paid more respect to the European, and obeyed his orders with far more
alacrity than they did those of Bukht Khan or any other of their nominal
leaders.After crossing the Jumna the European remained with the rebels
till they reached a safe retreat on the Oude side of the Ganges, when he
left the force in company with the Raja of Surajpore, a petty state on
the Oude side about twenty or twenty-five miles above Cawnpore.About
this time my informant, Doorga Sing, having been wounded at Delhi, left
the rebel army _en route_ to Lucknow, and returned to his village near
Onao in Oude; but hearing of the advance of the English, and expecting
no mercy, he and several others repaired to Lucknow, and rejoined their
old comrades.He did not again see the European till after the fall of Lucknow, when
he met him at Fort Rooyah, where he commanded the sepoys, and was the
principal adviser of the Raja Nirput Singh, whom he prevented from
accepting the terms offered by the English through General Walpole.I am
fully convinced that this was the man whom we saw in the tree, and who
was reported to have killed Brigadier Hope.After their retreat from Rooyah the sepoys, under this European,
remained in the jungles till the English army had passed on to Bareilly,
when they reattacked Shahjehanpore, and would have retaken it, if a
brigade had not arrived from Bareilly to its relief.After being driven
back from Shahjehanpore the sepoys held together in Mahomdee, Sitapore,
and elsewhere, throughout the hot season of 1858, mostly under the
guidance of the European and Bukht Khan.The last time Doorga Sing saw
the renegade was after the battle of Nawabgunge in Oude, where Bukht
Khan was killed and a large number of the sepoys were driven across the
Raptee into Nepaul territory, upon which they held a council among
themselves and determined to follow their leaders no longer, but to give
themselves up to the nearest English post under the terms of the Queen's
proclamation.The European tried to dissuade them from doing this,
telling them that if they gave themselves up they would all be hanged
like dogs or sent in chains across the _Kala Pani_.[61] But they had
already suffered too much to be further imposed upon, and one of their
number, who had gone to get information about other parties who were
known to have given themselves up to the English, returned at this time
with information that all sepoys who had not taken part in murdering
their officers were, after giving up their arms, provided with a pass
and paid two rupees each, and allowed to return to their villages.On
this the greater part of the sepoys, including all left alive of the
Ninth Regiment, told the European that they had resolved to listen to
him no longer, but to return to their villages and their families, after
giving themselves up at the nearest English post.Thereupon the _sahib_
sat down and commenced to shed tears, saying _he_ had neither home nor
country to return to.There he was left, with a few more whose crimes
had placed them beyond the hope of pardon; and that was the last which
Doorga Sing saw or heard of the European general of the mutineer
artillery.Before writing this, I have often cross-questioned Doorga Sing about
this European, and his statements never vary.He says that the time is
now so long past that he could not be sure of the _sahib's_ name even if
he heard it; but he is positive he came from Bareilly, and that his rank
before the Mutiny was sergeant-major, and that he had formerly been in
the Company's artillery.He thinks, however, that at the time of the
Mutiny this sergeant was serving with one of the native infantry
regiments in Bareilly; and he further recollects that it was commonly
reported in the sepoy ranks that when the Mutiny broke out this
sergeant-major had advised the murder of all the European officers,
himself shooting the adjutant of the regiment with his own hand to prove
his loyalty to the rebel cause.The whole narrative is so extraordinary that I publish it with a view to
discovering if there are any still living who can give facts bearing on
this strange, but, I am convinced, true story.Doorga Sing promised to
find for me one or two other mutineer sepoys who knew more about this
European and his antecedents than he himself did.I have no detailed
statement of the Mutiny at Bareilly, and the short account which I
possess merely says that, "As soon as the artillery fired the signal gun
in their lines, Brigadier Sibbald mounted his horse and galloped off to
the cavalry lines, but was met on the way by a party of infantry, who
fired on him.He received a bullet in his chest, and then turned his
horse and galloped to the appointed rendezvous for the Europeans, and,
on arriving there, dropped dead from his horse."The account then goes
on to say: "The European sergeant-major had remained in the lines, and
Adjutant Tucker perished while endeavouring to save the life of the
sergeant-major."The question arises--Is it possible that this
sergeant-major can have been the same man whom Doorga Sing afterwards
met in command of the rebel ranks in Delhi, and who was said to have
killed his adjutant?FOOTNOTES:

A FEW WORDS ON SWORD-BLADES


A short time back I read an article on sword-blades, reprinted I believe
from some English paper.Now, in a war like the Mutiny sword-blades are
of the utmost importance to men who depend on them either for taking or
preserving life; I will therefore state my own experience, and give
opinions on the swords which came under my observation, and I may at
once say that I think there is great room for improvement in our blades
of Birmingham manufacture.I consider that the swords supplied to our
officers, cavalry and artillery, are far inferior as weapons of offence
to a really good Oriental _tulwar_.Although an infantry man I saw a
good deal of sword-practice, because all the men who held the
Secundrabagh and the Begum's Kothee were armed with native _tulwars_
from the King of Oude's armoury, in addition to their muskets and
bayonets, and a large proportion of our men were killed and wounded by
sword-cuts.In the first place, then, for cutting our English regulation swords are
too straight; the Eastern curved blade is far more effective as a
cutting weapon.Secondly, our English swords are far too blunt, whereas
the native swords are as keen in edge as a well-stropped razor.Our
steel scabbards again are a mistake for carrying sharp blades; and, in
addition to this, I don't think our mounted branches who are armed with
swords have proper appliances given to them for sharpening their edges.Even in time of peace, but especially in time of war, more attention
ought to be given to this point, and every soldier armed with a sword
ought to be supplied with the means of sharpening it, and made to keep
it with an edge like a razor.I may mention that this fact was noticed
in the wars of the Punjab, notably at Ramnugger, where our English
cavalry with their blunt swords were most unequally matched against the
Sikhs with _tulwars_ so keen of edge that they would split a hair.I remember reading of a regiment of British cavalry charging a regiment
of Sikh cavalry.The latter wore voluminous thick _puggries_ round their
heads, which our blunt swords were powerless to cut through, and each
horseman had also a buffalo-hide shield slung on his back.They
evidently knew that the British swords were blunt and useless, so they
kept their horses still and met the British charge by lying flat on
their horses' necks,[62] with their heads protected by the thick turban
and their backs by the shields; and immediately the British soldiers
passed through their ranks the Sikhs swooped round on them and struck
them back-handed with their sharp, curved swords, in several instances
cutting our cavalry men in two.In one case a British officer, who was
killed in the charge I describe, was hewn in two by a back-handed stroke
which cut right through an ammunition-pouch, cleaving the pistol-bullets
right through the pouch and belt, severing the officer's backbone and
cutting his heart in two from behind.It was the same in the Balaclava
charge, both with the Heavy and the Light Brigade.Their swords were too
straight, and so blunt that they would not cut through the thick coats
and sheep-skin caps of the Russians; so that many of our men struck with
the hilts at the faces of the enemy, as more effective than attempting
to cut with their blunt blades.In the article on English sword-blades to which I have referred, stress
is laid on the superiority of blades of spring steel, tempered so that
the tip can be bent round to the hilt without breaking or preventing the
blade assuming the straight immediately it is released.Now my
observations lead me to consider spring steel to be totally unfitted for
a sword-blade.The real Damascus blade that we have all read about, but
so few have seen, is as rigid as cast-iron, without any spring
whatever,--as rigid as the blade of a razor.The sword-blade which bends
is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert
and powerful swordsman.A blade of spring steel will not cut through the
bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand
and will not cut through.Let any sword-maker in Birmingham try
different blades in the hands of an expert swordsman on a green tree of
soft wood, and the rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four
times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can
bend into a circle, tip to hilt.My opinion is that the motto of a
sword-blade ought to be the same as the Duke of Sutherland's--"_Frangas
non flectes_, Thou mayest break but not bend"; and if blades could be
made that would neither break nor bend, so much the better.I believe that the manufacture of real Damascus steel blades is a lost
art.When serving in the Punjab about thirty years ago, I was well
acquainted with an old man in Lahore who had been chief armourer to
Runjeet Sing, and he has often told me that the real Damascus blades
contained a large percentage of arsenic amalgamated with the steel while
the blades were being forged, which greatly added to their hardness,
toughness, and strength, preserved the steel from rust, and enabled the
blades to be sharpened to a very fine edge.This old man's test for a
sword-blade was to get a good-sized fish, newly caught from the river,
lay it on a soft, yielding bed,--cotton quilt folded up, or any soft
yielding substance,--and the blade that did not cut the fish in two
across the thickest part behind the gills, cutting against the scales,
at one stroke, was considered of no account whatever.From what I have
seen no sword-blade that bends, however sharp it may be, will do that,
because the spring in the steel causes the blade to glance off the fish,
and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.Nor will any of our straight sword-blades cut a large fish through in
this manner; whereas the curved Oriental blade, with a drawing cut,
severs it at once, because the curved blade presents much more cutting
surface.One revolution of a circular saw cuts much deeper into wood
than one stroke of a straight saw, although the length of the straight
saw may be equal to the circumference of the circular one.So it is with
sword-blades.A stroke from a curved blade, drawn through, cuts far
deeper than the stroke from a straight blade.[63]

I will mention one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of
the force of a sword-cut from a curved sword of rigid steel.There were
three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David,
James, and John.They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life,
and all three had served through the Crimea.David was a sergeant, and
his two brothers were privates.When falling in for the assault on the
Begum's palace, John Ready took off his Crimean medal and gave it to his
brother David, telling him that he felt a presentiment that he would be
killed in that attack, and that David had better keep his medal, and
send it home to their mother.David tried to reason him out of his
fears, but to no purpose.John Ready replied that he had no fear, and
his mother might know that he had died doing his duty.Well, the assault
took place, and in the inner courts of the palace there was one division
held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as
razors, and circular shields, and the party of the Ninety-Third who got
into that court were far out-numbered on this occasion, as in fact we
were everywhere else.On entering James Ready was attacked by a _sowar_
armed with sword and shield.Ready's feather bonnet was knocked off, and
the _sowar_ got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his
skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and
half-way down through the breast-bone.John Ready sprang to the
assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet
reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal
thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword,
wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man, and he also was cut right
through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and
right arm were clean severed from the body.The _sowar_ delivered his
stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of
John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.David
Ready, the sergeant, seized the _tulwar_ that had killed both his
brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as
if they had been mere heads of cabbage.When the fight was over I
examined that sword.It was of ordinary weight, well-balanced, curved
about a quarter-circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as
rigid as cast-iron.Now, my experience is that none of our very best
English swords could have cut like this one.A sword of that quality
would cut through a man's skull or thigh-bone without the least quiver,
as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow.I may also mention the case of a young officer named Banks, of the
Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of
Ghazis.One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut
off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound
produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved _tulwar_.I don't know if
the young fellow got over it;[64] but he was reported to be still alive,
and even cheerful when we marched from Lucknow.In this matter of sword-blades, I have no wish to dogmatise or to pose
as an authority; I merely state my observations and opinion, in the
hopes that they may lead to experiments being made.The sharpening of our cavalry swords, if still the same as
in 1857, receives far too little attention.FOOTNOTES:

[62] In which case they would have been simply ridden over.Mitchell's are quite true as regards curved
swords; but he forgets that the _point_ is the most effective attack
against Eastern swordsmen.APPENDIX D

THE OPIUM QUESTION


On the afternoon of the 19th August, 1892, I left Cawnpore for Lucknow.As I was a few minutes before time, I walked along the railway-platform
to see the engine, and, strange to relate, the engine attached to the
train which was to take me into Lucknow (under circumstances very
different from those of 1857) was No.In 1857 I had crossed the
Ganges in the ranks of the Ninety-Third Highlanders, with the figures 93
on the front of my cap, and here I was, under very different
circumstances, revisiting Lucknow for the first time thirty-five years
after, and the engine to the train was No.I need not say that I
lifted my hat to that engine.As a matter of fact, I never do pass the
old number without giving it a salute; but in this instance I looked
upon it as a happy omen for the success of my journey.I took my seat in the carriage, and shortly after was joined by a
gentleman whom I took to be a Mahommedan; but to my surprise he told me
that he was a Christian employed in the Educational Department, and that
he was going to Lucknow for a month's holiday.He appeared to be a man
of over sixty years of age, but said he was only fifty-four, and that he
would retire from Government service next year.Of course I introduced
the subject of the Mutiny, and asked him where he had been at the time.He stated that when the Mutiny broke out he was at school in Bareilly,
and that he was then a Mahommedan, but did not join in the rebellion;
that on the outbreak of the Mutiny, when all the Europeans were either
killed or fled from Bareilly, he had retired to his village near
Shahjehanpore, and remained there till order was re-established on the
advance of the English into Rohilcund in May, 1858, after Khan Bahadoor
Khan had reigned in Bareilly twelve months.In course of conversation I asked my companion if he could give any
reason why it was that the whole rural population of Oude had joined the
urban population against the British in 1857, whereas on the south side
of the Ganges the villagers were in favour of the British, where they
were not overawed by the mutineers?He told me a strange thing, and that
was that he was fully convinced that the main reason why the village
population of Oude joined the city population of Lucknow was owing to
the oppression caused by our introduction of the opium-tax among the
people.At first I misunderstood him, and thought I had come across an agent of
the Anti-Opium Society."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

                  *       *       *       *       *

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."[1] As the
subject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and
ethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to
the demand.[Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan.W. J.
Herschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,
1880.]Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an
ethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity.Herschel
considers the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for
twenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger
marks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and
repudiation.Doolittle, in his "Social Life of the Chinese," describes
the custom.I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of
employing digital rugae as a sign manual is alluded to.I doubt if its
employment in the courts is of ancient date.Well-informed natives think
that it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in
Egypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found.Just as the
Chinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing
thereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of
women, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it
is represented, required confessions to be sealed with their
thumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China.Great
importance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,
"finger form."Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,
and the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print
of the prisoner.No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a
contumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the
act which is a prerequisite to his execution.Digital signatures are
sometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general
in command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops.A document thus
attested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so
easily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes
in the physiognomy, the rugae of the fingers present the same appearance
from the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there.In the
army everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the
relative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted.It
is called taking the "whelk striae," the fusiform being called "rice
baskets," and the volutes "peck measures."A person unable to write, the
form of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in
certain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women.Often when
a child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of
sale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,
he marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the
purchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,
the four organs duly smeared with ink.Professional fortune tellers in
China take into account almost the entire system of the person whose
future they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,
but the rugae of the finger-ends do not receive much attention.Amateur
fortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists
do of "bumps"--it is so easy.In children the relative number of volute
and conical striae indicate their future."If there are nine volutes,"
says a proverb, "to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without
toil."Regarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that
the rugae of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so
little uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,
and while the striae may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal
questions, heredity is not one of them.*       *       *       *       *




LUCIDITY.At the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening
of the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr.Matthew
Arnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the
memories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,
it was the word _lucidity_.If he had to fix upon the three great wants
at this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say
that the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of
the Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.Our own want was, of course, what concerned us the most.People were apt
to remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think
that the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which
they saw accompanying them.There was no greater and salutary lesson for
men to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,
by grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by
terrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable.Let him
illustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would
all readily feel.Seriousness was a quality of our nation.Perhaps
seriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers.But, at any rate,
many of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness
accompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was
disagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to
it.Let them follow the same
mode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity.The French had a
national turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.Perhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain
dangers.Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,
along with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,
and other faults, which greatly displeased us.Many of us were inclined
in consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they
had it.We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was
valuable as our seriousness was valuable.Both the one and the other
were valuable, and in the end indispensable.It was negatively that the French have it, and he
would therefore deal with its negative character merely.Negatively,
lucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in
notions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,
that their time is finished, and they can serve us no more.All through
the last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward
in France.Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally
repulsion in England, Voltaire.Voltaire did a great deal of harm in
France.But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by
his want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for
much that is deepest in human nature.Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who
worked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for
intelligence.But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther
of the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.As Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an
antipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object
of their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,
so much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with
them--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and
the cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.Voltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true
conception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary
for man."_Il faut douner a notre ame toutes les formes possibles_"
was a maxim which Voltaire really and truly applied in practice,
"advancing," as Michelet finely said of him, in every direction with
a marvelous vigor and with that conquering ambition which Vico called
_mens heroica_.Voltaire's signal characteristic was his
lucidity, his negative lucidity.There was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the
eighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into
France; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity
which the French had.Our leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which
distinguished Voltaire.In their free inquiry they soon found themselves
coming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,
conventions.Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to
sway them.The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned
their eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and
the light."It seems highly probable," said Voltaire, "that nature has
made thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of
trees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet."So our
reason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not
assure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he
did not venture to announce it.The French Revolution came, England grew
to abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,
gained much, but not in lucidity.The Continent was reopened, the
century advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of
free and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among
us.But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the
reign of lucidity.Let them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just
now: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations.They would
see numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and
a total absence of lucidity.A little lucidity would make the whole
movement impossible.That movement took for granted as its basis what
was no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all
they did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and
neither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking
themselves whether it was solid or not.Taking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and
import, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,
laborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr.Pusey, which had just
ended.Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that
acute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr.Mozley, an account of
that great movement which took from Dr.Of its
later stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated
experience.It had produced men to
be respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,
goodness, genius, and charm.But could they resist the truth that
lucidity would have been fatal to it?The movers of all those questions
about apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive
usage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on
which he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by
taking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on
this basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their
basis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?He would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory
possession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and
that it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and
spiritually all abroad.If they saw it accompanied in France by much
that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would
have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural
seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their
love for the past.Come it must; and here where it had been so late in
coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without
danger.Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for
the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,
and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often
they had it not.To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,
and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged
in business, was more difficult.Schools and universities, with serious
and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the
other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the
best agency they could use.It might be slow, but it was sure.Such
an agency they were now going to employ.Might it fulfill all their
expectations!Might their students, in the words quoted just now,
advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that
conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_!And among the many
good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst
of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *




ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate
under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed
amid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the
twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,
I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest
for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a
very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a
point that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he
attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon
utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of
making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an
envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch
meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with
mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal
bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt
for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots
formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one
and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron
frame.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a
close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution
of alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos
cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet
contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a
single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of
double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with
the hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to
humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with
it.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini
began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double
layer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of
a candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the
asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his
hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot
iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or
fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to
the furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands
in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which
fagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the
wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos
bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his
breast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a
great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head
and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic
des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,
connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave
between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,
when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than
20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between
them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini
suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and
walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire
was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these
men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a
child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos
bonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another
occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and
whose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained
therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;
but he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that
man can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot
be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage
through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great
resistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,
are direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first
experiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander
remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On
breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several
degrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,
produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the
same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of
a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience
a sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue
of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal
temperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which
the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein
eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the
coolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he
experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he
felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to
leave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the
minute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether
there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find
out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot
air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in
the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty
minutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in
England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate
was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate
vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of
the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in
the eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a
furnace at 132 deg.C.

The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be
attributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity
of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical
phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,
diminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict
which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living
being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the
surrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man
resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated
with vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature
varying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve
minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the
Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.
Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This
physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at
Pekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling
that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the
body.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater
in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become
still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a
solid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges
water of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more
than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six
minutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near
a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly
bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear
one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished
to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber
nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of
posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,
and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set
on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the
chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through
pipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the
neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor
was composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance
"Sethos," printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary
frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of
an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought
in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,
but I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that
this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the
imagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the
grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero
was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose
it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care
to place his feet.He who had the
courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly
would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no
other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as
soon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense
grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a
temperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the
two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had
also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini
experiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,
which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying
brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from
the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *




THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to
a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a
solid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the
log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone
enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the
surface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and
durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities
than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded
in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by
the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the
colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list
of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are
described as being "fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and
stone," were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated
instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last
century; but they are rare.The edifice known as "King's Chapel,"
Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from
American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also
found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite
quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,
and work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of
the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to
New Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as
a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in
New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of
Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic
coast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole
blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from
the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;
this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset
River, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent
granite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island
acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic
therein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this
valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been
wrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental
designs are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser
quality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in
large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect
harbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New
York.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy
granite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for
building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both
the Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large
supplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the
same character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,
Va, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and
in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.Much southern
granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky
Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet
quarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size
and shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and
transported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series
of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance
apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each
gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be
evenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as
freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back
further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to
as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at
Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were
worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many
distant points in the country.The long rows of "brownstone fronts" in
New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the
walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The
old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology
for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed
in the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured
ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The
sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the
product of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also
for a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of
seventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and
Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been
reached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an
inch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace
hearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone
of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;
as it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties
sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;
the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,
Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region
quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large
sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of
Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that
section for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor
quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it
was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,
Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,
which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake
Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone
is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for
building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious
objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,
which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York
they are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and
Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,
but it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and
Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,
Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great
favorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used
for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also
yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by
burning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no
means equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with
Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation
for nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points
along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and
going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,
N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly
excellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior
sort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield
a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east
for supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very
abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of
colors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for
gravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than
granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the
latter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and
like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and
veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls
were made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard
College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the
Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The
new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures
composed of this material.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere
amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same
amount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States
fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes
from Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest
specimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where
the only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it
deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to
the south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at
Shoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same
state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they
become more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found
in New England is of an inferior quality.The pillars of Girard
College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in
reputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high
colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of
Vermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial
days.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing
and school purposes.It is
stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as
early as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the
business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From
this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being
an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product
down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached
the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles
north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the
business.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are
confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has
a limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of
Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike
County, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from
Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and
our product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,
such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various
parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed
account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *




AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the
increase in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within
twenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like
proportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due
to the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may
imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which
immigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an
important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in
the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in
these as in States of the far West or the South.In New York there has
been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms
since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in
Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and
doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much
smaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully
settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and
yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in
Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.The
obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has
created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be
most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this
fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one
of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The
man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different
footing from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter
that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or
managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the
settlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where
new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in
number of farms has been over 55 per cent.In Wisconsin, though the
increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the
reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in
Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in
Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In
these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a
change in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,
though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the
Northwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large
farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States
where land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where
174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with
23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433
farms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,
against 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have
been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new
settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in
the older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms
thirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years
has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in
New York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more
farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,
and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has
increased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina
80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956
to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864
farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These
proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal
a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the
force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the
States named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes
greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi
River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic
coast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292
farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,
or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In
Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per
cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,
against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern
States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of
the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the
Atlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows
and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within
a few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or
occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *




A FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article
furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years
ago:

[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,
Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well
without brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises
about five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by
25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round
iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened
to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top
should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed
about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.The arch
should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top
and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little
incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch
should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of
the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or
two may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by
1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots
fastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps
are laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be
pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to
circumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars
11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes
drilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a
stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick
and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000
fire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half
the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of
common brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of
the well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive
of the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have
proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being
absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so
great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was
demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that
principle.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires
about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am
told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the
quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of
the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together
as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The
business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level
with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,
with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and
a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location
should be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas
of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be
reduced, if desired.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for
that, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *




THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are
five apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,
for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great
degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,
even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and
the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory
is located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in
regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be
new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory
is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A
portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,
the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the
evaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,
and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large
bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which
the apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has
a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a
grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough
half submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds
as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,
considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a
distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the
basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular
fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit
the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are
thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the
friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing
of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed
sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away
with other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an
endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with
iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story
of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press
is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,
being actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers
inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden
time, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from
the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the
defecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet
wide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in
diameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting
these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,
penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and
under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2
inches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as
manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the
pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch
underneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large
or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at
a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves
are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the
pipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities
and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of
pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,
expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An
ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it
over the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the
pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is
curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined
plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a
trough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator
is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the
specific gravity of about 20 deg.When of this consistency the liquid
is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a
siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the
same framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each
twelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed
or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted
with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space
surrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends
permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the
steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame
so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of
the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular
succession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam
gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other
pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being
let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of
sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes
any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;
passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel
connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the
whole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from
20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes
later at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on
cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to
vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon
bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in
expressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions
the necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese
is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no
cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large
water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by
means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,
trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and
cleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the
defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and
purified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,
the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the
evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider
instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn
off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency
desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing
the steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub
holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little
variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit
used are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,
into the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite
form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden
bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds
respectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience
in handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to
1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that
improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a
ton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds
of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than
earlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,
natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all
varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general
quality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground
under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a
succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it
is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of
the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds
becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp
floats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove
nearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is
sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole
establishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half
cubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,
who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the
accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one
sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs
into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds
the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the
defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman
and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general
helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever
needed.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,
and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides
considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled
cider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was
six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor
hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are
important to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise
valuable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no
market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can
be used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water
draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press
and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found
to make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting
the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant
years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over
to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant
form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of
great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value
for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,
for use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to
grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that
a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,
Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit
and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in
this country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to
the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby
rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality
generally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire
support.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases
the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a
result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it
and the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper
by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage
thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative
inefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an
average of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference
of 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the
practical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of
grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only
be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,
either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel
the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their
utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental
varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are
scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At
any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to
neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the
best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen
out of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to
nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much
appreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor
culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under
glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords
some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid
reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a
general way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and
checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to
get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes
would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average
temperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical
contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average
warmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure
the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor
culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now
practicable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying
mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting
administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for
the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving
rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and
autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these
glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening
of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being
employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and
shapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing
the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to
preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in
the Garden_.*       *       *       *       *




UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an
experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the
English public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration
and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very
brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which
printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the
_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the
same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive
steam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to
demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the
solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems
capable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,
indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have
suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other
mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been
lacking.About fifteen years ago
Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and
his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much
labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come
to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes
at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is
evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be
heated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two
and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying
by distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be
easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the
worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is
insured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published
an interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify
his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee
made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of
fuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it
is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field
good water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial
importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is
settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission
forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report
immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen
fighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but
a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest
delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London

HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been
of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,
and the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the
needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate
determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very
unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and
even death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to
dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle
in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of
traversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a
greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are
generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be
readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application
in practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the
true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of
latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true
meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to
these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,
instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the
probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time
may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is
referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes
lost in "confusion worse confounded," and gives up in despair, settling
down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is
the best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I
have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the
method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently
clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make
use of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with
the


DEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all
celestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the
earth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing
through the axis.All meridians are therefore north and south lines
passing through the poles.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at
the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a
bearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are
obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,
and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the
meridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is
generally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,
in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13",[1] making the revolution in
23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above
the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the
latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass
through the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former
is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,
or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too
complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or
lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this
involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude
of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and
moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to
the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,
an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would
introduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,
however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,
that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the
error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be
inappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make
the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be
given.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the
relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,
and Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is
horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the
latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:

[Illustration]

But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will
be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be
turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,
called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the
observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be
computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his
_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the
celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;
then N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the
latitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle
of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the
latitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,
preceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called
the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a
plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the
normal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,
hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith
and nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object
is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical
circle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the
difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith
distance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane
through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the
horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at
90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the
position of any object with reference to the observer's place.The
latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude
referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,
and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to
the latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,
in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1
will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,
and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C
Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be
subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the
latitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either
above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for
refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its
_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for
ordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with
sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction
is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by
looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the
observer's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07",
should be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 53" for the
latitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the
latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the
required azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical
triangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the
north pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar
distance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z
P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from
which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the
following table:

An analysis of this table shows that the azimuth this year (1882)
increases with the latitude from 1 deg.It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at
any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year.This
is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar
distance.north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth
is about 22", while at 50 deg.As the variation in
azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed
for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily
obtained by interpolation.We see also that an error of a few minutes of
latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the
azimuth at 40 deg.44'
56", the difference (01' 35") being the correction for one degree of
latitude between 40 deg.Or, in other words, an error of one degree
in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth
of one and a half minutes.With ordinary care the probable error of the
latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed
a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an
ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.REFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED

APPLICATIONS.In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at
intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The
first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit
with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,
etc.[1] Having "set up" over the point through which it is proposed to
establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and
Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached
level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical
arc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its
_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as
it moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest
part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant
to hold the "bull's eye" so as to reflect enough light down the tube
from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the
star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in
this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_
wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it "rides" along this
wire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the
vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the
_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by
2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the
complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has
sufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at
its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the
horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another
reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the
_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two
pointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting
from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the
refraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must
now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,
or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the
meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his
date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made
on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so
that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be
brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by
means of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]

It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of
observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star
may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at
the surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of
the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in
permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not
placed near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,
the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting
an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the
needle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is
west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and
_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the
sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of
time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,
compared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by
taking the difference between the local lime of this and any other
place, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can
readily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of
first contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and
take the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________

THE OCELLATED PHEASANT.The collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been
enriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of
bird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their
desiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity
of naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal
feathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the
galleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at
the museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux
Paralleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a
few years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the
Phasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not
till 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural
History, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out
the peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the
Museum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves
nothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of
Verreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose
tail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that
the museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an
ordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named
_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of
the family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat
has given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common
Argus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not
formed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very
long feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists
of twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with
ocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is
adorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its
system of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its
body are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,
then, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,
in the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,
after a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name
_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for
that of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which
belong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be
larger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft
on the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest
0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are
brown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy
feathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck
with piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is
of a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole
dotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are
found on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become
elongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite
regularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail
and on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous
blotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface
of the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,
are disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This
similitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the
distinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many
other Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are
considerably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,
all spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length
from the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of
insertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to
a sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and
width which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to
describe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The
beak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,
exactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the
base, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval
form.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet
and legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are
destitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate
toes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is
inserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This
magnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored
by Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south
of Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *




THE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,
is not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the
most interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a
Conifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,
to that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but
distinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous
radiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the
larch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow
color before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but
generally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we
believe, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other
trees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies
fortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,
it is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or
other unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary
representative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the
coal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,
Professor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty
species and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through
the northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least
certain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it
be the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and
described by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the
middle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as
to the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.The
Frenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English
nurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese
seeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too
well.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and
sold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next
morning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to
regain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had
given for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to
France, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree
got the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by
Loudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the
perfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on
another.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated
from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured
grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the
female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is
quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only
may sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of
this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in
other dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near
Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be
attributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and
is about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth
at 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837
a tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon
himself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female
branch was grafted.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since
perished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is
allied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to
the larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and
male catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with
long extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation
between the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of
their production is not understood, though in all probability a little
observation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,
greatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar "corpuscles" common to Cycads
and Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2
to 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the
case.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the
proof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,
such as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar
venation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between
ordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to
connect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within
the shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young
stem bears its leaves in threes.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of
this tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest
consists.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with
leaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and
others with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]*       *       *       *       *




THE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being
prepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of
Natural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in
Central Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,
some inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn
longitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all
but 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and
nearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26
varieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter
sets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from
the groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are
engaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they
reach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this
method being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and
delicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in
process of transportation from various parts of the country to this
city.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect
specimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in
making the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the
museum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the
tree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north
to Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the
west--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a
representative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are
green, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival
is to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from
"checking," as it is technically called, or "season cracking," as the
unscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during
the seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons
much more quickly than does the heart of the wood.The prevention of
this splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for
exhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for
exhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens
is now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and
alongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood
seasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many
instances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the
collection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,
has been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge
crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as
though some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and
had made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the
persimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to
impossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic
of the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at
all obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with
a regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree
during each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly
marked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric
circles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows
older.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the
collection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which
this wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the "Pride of India."The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it
and the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an
abnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is
one and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts
who have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams
referred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of
exhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center
down about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and
the semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.The
upper end is then beveled.When a log is thus treated the inspector can
see the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did
when growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood
and to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and
carefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled
sections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may
be made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half
of this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half
left in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is
entirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected
by Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds
of trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually
neglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental
wood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of
comparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared
for exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a
specimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches
in length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The
specimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might
be transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of
a box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city
without change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a
portion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The
trunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of
treatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an
irregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves
springing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated
trees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,
and though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang
out, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was
supposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when
the workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new
life, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the
otherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again
before the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the
Douglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided
curiosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,
two inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to
the-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,
which have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes
in the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest
specimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a
species of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable
elevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the
concentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles
the black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain
growths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the
Indians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its
age to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of
the white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The
next largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,
variously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,
which is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of
the redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from
the Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet
in diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of
the enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the
impossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room
in the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of
the largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents
a circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to
have the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other
purposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.
Jesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of
specimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the
exhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,
and appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be
exhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the
tar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in
an herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as
possible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public
view next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete
one of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,
as far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,
France, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is
proposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires
that teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food
and clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great
assistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay
out private and public parks so that the most striking effects of
foliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in
this country in our own Central Park, where there are more different
varieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other
area in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained
one now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With
this exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for
the botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to
it.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to
cultivate trees as he would other crops.The rapid disappearance of
many valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in
supply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in
the not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the
country.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Scientific American Supplement No.Beautiful
indignation lightened from the dark eyes and sat on the pouting lip of
Norah M’Diarmod--for it was the chieftain’s daughter--as she turned
disdainfully towards him.“Is it the bravery of an O’Rourke to hunt a woman with his dogs?Young
chief, you stand upon the ground of M’Diarmod, and your name from the
lips of her”--she stopped, for she had time to glance again upon his
features, and had no longer heart to upbraid one who owned a countenance
so handsome and so gallant, so eloquent of embarrassment as well as
admiration.Her tone of asperity and wounded pride declined into a murmur of
acquiescence as she hearkened to the apologies and deprecations of the
youth, whose gallantry and feats had so often rung in her ears, though
his person she had but casually seen, and his voice she had never before
heard.He had often listened to the
praises of Norah’s beauty; he had occasionally caught distant glimpses of
her graceful figure; and the present sight, or after recollection, often
mitigated his feelings to her hostile clan, and, to his advantage, the
rugged old chief was generally associated with the lovely dark-eyed girl
who was his only child.Such being their respective feelings, what could be the result of
their romantic rencounter?They were both young, generous children
of nature, with hearts fraught with the unhacknied feelings of youth
and inexperience: they had drunk in sentiment with the sublimities
of their mountain homes, and were fitted for higher things than the
vulgar interchange of animosity and contempt.Of this they soon were
conscious, and they did not separate until the stars began to burn above
them, and not even then, before they had made arrangements for at least
another--one more secret interview.The islet possessed a beautiful
fitness for their trysting place, as being accessible from either side,
and little obnoxious to observation; and many a moonlight meeting--for
the _one_ was inevitably multiplied--had these children of hostile
fathers, perchance on the very spot on which my eyes now rested, and
the unbroken stillness around had echoed to their gladsome greetings or
their faltering farewells.Neither dared to divulge an intercourse that
would have stirred to frenzy the treasured rancour of their respective
parents, each of whom would doubtless have preferred a connexion with
a blackamoor--if such were then in circulation--to their doing such
grievous despite to that ancient feud which as an heirloom had been
transmitted from ancestors whose very names they scarcely knew.M’Diarmod
the Dark-faced was at best but a gentle tiger even to his only child; and
though his stern cast-iron countenance would now and then relax beneath
her artless blandishments, yet even with the lovely vision at his side,
he would often grimly deplore that she had not been a son, to uphold the
name and inherit the headship of the clan, which on his demise would
probably pass from its lineal course; and when he heard of the bold
bearing of the heir of O’Rourke, he thought he read therein the downfall
of the M’Diarmods when he their chief was gone.With such ill-smothered
feelings of discontent he could not but in some measure repulse the
filial regards of Norah, and thus the confiding submission that would
have sprung to meet the endearments of his love, was gradually refused
to the inconsistencies of his caprice; and the maiden in her intercourse
with her proscribed lover rarely thought of her father, except as one
from whom it should be diligently concealed.One of the night marauders of his
clan chanced in an evil hour to see Connor O’Rourke guiding his coracle
to the island, and at the same time a cloaked female push cautiously
from the opposite shore for the same spot.Surprised, he crouched among
the fern till their landing and joyous greeting put all doubt of their
friendly understanding to flight; and then, thinking only of revenge or
ransom, the unsentimental scoundrel hurried round the lake to M’Diarmod,
and informed him that the son of his mortal foe was within his reach.The old man leaped from his couch of rushes at the thrilling news, and,
standing on his threshold, uttered a low gathering-cry, which speedily
brought a dozen of his more immediate retainers to his presence.As he
passed his daughter’s apartment, he for the first time asked himself who
can the woman be?and at the same moment almost casually glanced at
Norah’s chamber, to see that all there was quiet for the night.A shudder
of vague terror ran through his sturdy frame as his eye fell on the low
open window.He thrust in his head, but no sleeper drew breath within; he
re-entered the house and called aloud upon his daughter, but the echo of
her name was the only answer.A kern coming up put an end to the search,
by telling that he had seen his young mistress walking down to the
water’s edge about an hour before, but that, as she had been in the habit
of doing so by night for some time past, he had thought but little of it.The odious truth was now revealed, and, trembling with the sudden gust of
fury, the old chief with difficulty rushed to the lake, and, filling a
couple of boats with his men, told them to pull for the honour of their
name and for the head of the O’Rourke’s first-born.During this stormy prelude to a bloody drama, the doomed but unconscious
Connor was sitting secure within the dilapidated chapel by the side
of her whom he had won.Her quickened ear first caught the dip of an
oar, and she told her lover; but he said it was the moaning of the
night-breeze through the willows, or the ripple of the water among the
stones, and went on with his gentle dalliance.A few minutes, however,
and the shock of the keels upon the ground, the tread of many feet, and
the no longer suppressed cries of the M’Diarmods, warned him to stand on
his defence; and as he sprang from his seat to meet the call, the soft
illumination of love was changed with fearful suddenness into the baleful
fire of fierce hostility.“My Norah, leave me; you may by chance be rudely handled in the scuffle.”

The terrified but faithful girl fell upon his breast.“Connor, your fate is mine; hasten to your boat, if it be not yet too
late.”

An iron-shod hunting pole was his only weapon; and using it with his
right arm, while Norah hung upon his left, he sprang without further
parley through an aperture in the wall, and made for the water.But his
assailants were upon him, the M’Diarmod himself with upraised battle-axe
at their head.“Spare my father,” faltered Norah; and Connor, with a mercifully
directed stroke, only dashed the weapon from the old man’s hand, and
then, clearing a passage with a vigorous sweep, accompanied with the
well-known charging cry, before which they had so often quailed, bounded
through it to the water’s brink.An instant, and with her who was now
more than his second self, he was once more in his little boat; but,
alas!it was aground, and so quickly fell the blows against him, that he
dare not adventure to shove it off.Letting Norah slip from his hold,
she sank backwards to the bottom of the boat; and then, with both arms
free, he redoubled his efforts, and after a short but furious struggle
succeeded in getting the little skiff afloat.Maddened at the sight, the
old chief rushed breast-deep into the water; but his right arm had been
disabled by a casual blow, and his disheartened followers feared, under
the circumstances, to come within range of that well-wielded club.But
a crafty one among them had already seized on a safer and surer plan.He had clambered up an adjacent tree, armed with a heavy stone, and now
stood on one of the branches above the devoted boat, and summoned him to
yield, if he would not perish.The young chief’s renewed exertions were
his only answer.“Let him escape, and your head shall pay for it,” shouted the infuriated
father.“My young mistress?”

“There are enough here to save her, if I will it.Down with the stone, or
by the blood----”

He needed not to finish the sentence, for down at the word it came,
striking helpless the youth’s right arm, and shivering the frail timber
of the boat, which filled at once, and all went down.For an instant
an arm re-appeared, feebly beating the water in vain--it was the young
chief’s broken one: the other held his Norah in its embrace, as was seen
by her white dress flaunting for a few moments on and above the troubled
surface.The lake at this point was deep, and though there was a rush of
the M’Diarmods towards it, yet in their confusion they were but awkward
aids, and the fluttering ensign that marked the fatal spot had sunk
before they reached it.The strength of Connor, disabled as he was by
his broken limb, and trammelled by her from whom even the final struggle
could not dissever him, had failed; and with her he loved locked in his
last embrace, they were after a time recovered from the water, and laid
side by side upon the bank, in all their touching, though, alas, lifeless
beauty!Remorse reached the rugged hearts even of those who had so
ruthlessly dealt by them; and as they looked on their goodly forms, thus
cold and senseless by a common fate, the rudest felt that it would be
an impious and unpardonable deed to do violence to their memory, by the
separation of that union which death itself had sanctified.Thus were
they laid in one grave; and, strange as it may appear, their fathers,
crushed and subdued, exhausted even of resentment by the overwhelming
stroke--for nothing can quell the stubborn spirit like the extremity of
sorrow--crossed their arms in amity over their remains, and grief wrought
the reconciliation which even centuries of time, that great pacificator,
had failed to do.The westering sun now warning me that the day was on the wane, I gave but
another look to the time-worn tombstone, another sigh to the early doom
of those whom it enclosed, and then, with a feeling of regret, again left
the little island to its still, unshared, and pensive loneliness.ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE--No.The composition which we have selected as our fourth specimen of the
ancient literature of Ireland, is a poem, more remarkable, perhaps,
for its antiquity and historical interest, than for its poetic merits,
though we do not think it altogether deficient in those.It is ascribed,
apparently with truth, to the celebrated poet Mac Liag, the secretary of
the renowned monarch Brian Boru, who, as our readers are aware, fell at
the battle of Clontarf in 1014; and the subject of it is a lamentation
for the fallen condition of Kincora, the palace of that monarch,
consequent on his death.The decease of Mac Liag, whose proper name was Muircheartach, is thus
recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1015:--

“Mac Liag, i. e. Muirkeartach, son of Conkeartach, at this time laureate
of Ireland, died.”

A great number of his productions are still in existence; but none of
them have obtained a popularity so widely extended as the poem before us.Of the palace of Kincora, which was situated on the banks of the Shannon,
near Killaloe, there are at present no vestiges.LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA.A Chinn-copath carthi Brian?And where is the beauty that once was thine?Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate
    At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords?[1]
    And where are the warriors that Brian led on?And where is Morogh, the descendant of kings--
    The defeater of a hundred--the daringly brave--
    Who set but slight store by jewels and rings--
    Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave?And where is Donogh, King Brian’s worthy son?And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief?they are gone--
    They have left me this night alone with my grief!And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth,
    The never-vanquished son of Evin the Brave,
    The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth,
    And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave?Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swiftfooted Steeds?And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy?And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds
    In the red battle-field no time can destroy?And where is that youth of majestic height,
    The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?--Even he,
    As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might,
    Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me!They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,
    Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust,
    ’Tis weary for me to be living on the earth
    When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust!Oh, never again will Princes appear,
    To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords!I can never dream of meeting afar or anear,
    In the east or the west, such heroes and lords!Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up
    Of Brian Boru!--how he never would miss
    To give me at the banquet the first bright cup!why did he heap on me honour like this?I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake:
    Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled,
    Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake.that I should live, and Brian be dead![1] _Coolg n-or_, of the swords _of gold_, i. e. of the _gold-hilted_

next?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our
perusal?” There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and
unimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,
short-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of
our own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and
unpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the
biography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,
after, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear
their young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose
teeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the
family of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly
beautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and
without prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and
sleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes
large, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,
its agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are
several varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known
is the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,
or white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is
more rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think
we may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating
unchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,
and never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently
 parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an
account of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is
designed to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the
little creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care
and discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent
I employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and
which, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,
still remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by
resorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering
even the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to
explain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to
it, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would
give his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result
of his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will
recollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly
after having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances
required my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite
with me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire
cage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted
the precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some
untoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment
I awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the
cage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched
the bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but
all to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning
one of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed
him of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His
investigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor
little pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude
in leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its
brown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by
the terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious
artifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting
into the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came
running to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, “Mr R., Mr R., I declare
your little mouse is in the kitchen.” Begging the coachman to wait an
instant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,
seated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with
considerable _gout_, was my truant protegé.Once more secured within
its cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown
paper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage
was again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer
unavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one
night, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on
relighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,
who seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus
lost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea
of confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,
I placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out
as he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would
regularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such
periods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was
pretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared
by no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the
night-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to
me, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to
immerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the
warmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an
unusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice
running backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much
apparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual
disturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often
trembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many
strangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,
which perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four
o’clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning
on my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to
enjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a
slight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence
the noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I
at once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and
dirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his
darker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over
to his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within
it; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some
scrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on
this occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a
brown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,
to his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this
singular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and
breathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute
the two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large
piece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously
left.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having
deposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded
themselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they
remained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;
and when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three
other mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves
with bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After
this I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that
they had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor
was this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to
where he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread
or grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my
pet’s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger
was the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and
in about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping
upon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my
cheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she
should one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly
used all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her
dismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely
better entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was
compelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to
cats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far
as to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely
surprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the
following anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at
perceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath
the table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with
what appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and
concentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from
her chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being
terrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as
favoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a
gentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,
far from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself
on his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with
which any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and
positively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could
not jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I
stood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,
or seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt
at her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,
purred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the
mouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little
animal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its
boldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state
the fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently
extraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,
I got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to
preclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning
was I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the
wainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if
in order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet
contrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In
my room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my
little friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to
meddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,
and just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my
poor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up
his body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to
animation.His little body had been crushed
in the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been
endeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *

NOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers
as may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little
animals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage
out daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in
winter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the
mice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as
too moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to
produce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with
impunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat
or barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little
tin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely
fixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,
or too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves
between them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals
are fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,
would quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the
bird-shops in Patrick’s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage
makers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,
whose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about
Knightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence
per pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.




THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

them gesticulating, now toward the water, and again toward the timber.Finally, one went down to the extreme point and stepped off two hundred
and fifty paces inland.Bald-head pointed to the trees, a hundred yards away, and shook his
head.Then they produced a compass, and ran the
additional distance to the North-east."You'll have to work your brain a bit," Croyden added."The letter's
not all that's needed, thank Heaven!You've stolen the one, but you

picks and shovels, and, returning to the place, fell to work.After a short while, Bald-head threw down his pick and hoisted himself
out of the hole."He's got a glimmer of intelligence, at last," Croyden muttered.The discussion grew more animated, they waved their arms toward the
Bay, and toward the Severn, and toward the land.Hook-nose slammed his
pick up and down to emphasize his argument."They'll be doing the war dance, next!""'When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,'" Croyden
quoted."_More_ honest men, you mean--the comparative degree.""Life is made up of comparatives," said Croyden.as Bald-head faced about and stalked back to the buggy."He has simply quit digging a hole at random," Macloud said."My Lord,
he's taking a drink!"Bald-head, however, did not return to his companion.Instead, he went
out to the Bay and stood looking across the water toward the bug-light.Then he turned and looked back toward the timber.The land had been driving inward by the
encroachment of the Bay--the beeches had, long since, disappeared, the
victims of the gales which swept the Point.There was no place from
which to start the measurements.Beyond the fact that, somewhere near
by, old Parmenter had buried his treasure, one hundred and ninety years
before, the letter was of no definite use to anyone.From the Point, he retraced his steps leisurely to his companion, who
had continued digging, said something--to which Hook-nose seemingly
made no reply, save by a shovel of sand--and continued directly toward
the timber."I think not--these bushes are ample protection.Lie low.... He's not
coming this way--he's going to inspect the big trees, on our left....
They won't help you, my light-fingered friend; they're not the right
sort."After a time, Bald-head abandoned the search and went back to his
friend.Throwing himself on the ground, he talked vigorously, and,
apparently, to some effect, for, presently, the digging ceased and
Hook-nose began to listen.At length, he tossed the pick and shovel
aside, and lifted himself out of the hole.After a few more
gesticulations, they picked up the tools and returned to the buggy.said Croyden, as they drove away.At the first heavy
undergrowth, they stopped the horse and proceeded carefully to conceal
the tools.This accomplished, they drove off toward the town."I wish we knew," Croyden returned."It might help us--for quite
between ourselves, Macloud, I think we're stumped.""Our first business is to move on Washington and get the permit,"
Macloud returned."Hook-nose and his friend may have the Point, for
to-day; they're not likely to injure it.They were passing the Marine Barracks when Croyden, who had been
pondering over the matter, suddenly broke out:

"We've got to get rid of those two fellows, Colin!""We agree that we dare not have them arrested--they would blow
everything to the police.And the police would either graft us for all
the jewels are worth, or inform the Government.""Yes, but we may have to take the risk--or else divide up with the
thieves."There is another way--except killing them,
which, of course, would be the most effective.Why shouldn't we
imprison them--be our own jailers?"Macloud threw away his cigarette and lit another before he replied,
then he shook his head."Too much risk to ourselves," he said."Somebody would likely be killed
in the operation, with the chances strongly favoring ourselves.I'd
rather shoot them down from ambush, at once.""That may require an explanation to a judge and jury, which would be a
trifle inconvenient.I'd prefer to risk my life in a fight.Then, if it
came to court, our reputation is good, while theirs is in the rogues'
gallery."Think over it, while we're going to
Washington and back; see if you can't find a way out.Either we must
jug them, securely, for a week or two, or we must arrest them.On the
whole, it might be wiser to let them go free--let them make a try for
the treasure, unmolested.When they fail and retire, we can begin.""Your last alternative doesn't sound particularly attractive to me--or
to you, either, I fancy.""This isn't going to be a particularly attractive quest, if we want to
succeed," said Croyden."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways, I
reckon--blood and violence and sudden death.We'll try to play it
without death, however, if our opponents will permit.Such title, as
exists to Parmenter's hoard, is in me, and I am not minded to
relinquish it without a struggle.I wasn't especially keen at the
start, but I'm keen enough, now--and I don't propose to be blocked by
two rogues, if there is a way out.""And the way out, according to your notion, is to be our own jailers,
think you?""Well, we can chew on it--the manner of
procedure is apt to keep us occupied a few hours."They took the next train, on the Electric Line, to Washington, Macloud
having telephoned ahead and made an appointment with Senator
Rickrose--whom, luckily, they found at the Capital--to meet them at the
Metropolitan Club for luncheon.At Fourteenth Street, they changed to a
Connecticut Avenue car, and, dismounting at Seventeenth and dodging a
couple of automobiles, entered the Pompeian brick and granite building,
the home of the Club which has the most representative membership in
the country.Macloud was on the non-resident list, and the door-man, with the memory
for faces which comes from long practice, greeted him, instantly, by
name, though he had not seen him for months.Macloud, Senator Rickrose just came in," he said.He was very tall, with a tendency
to corpulency, which, however, was lost in his great height; very
dignified, and, for one of his service, very young--of immense
influence in the councils of his party, and the absolute dictator in
his own State.Inheriting a superb machine from a "matchless
leader,"--who died in the harness--he had developed it into a well
nigh perfect organization for political control.All power was in his
hands, from the lowest to the highest, he ruled with a sway as absolute
as a despot.His word was the ultimate law--from it an appeal did not
lie.he said to Macloud, dropping a hand on his
shoulder."I haven't seen you for a long time--and, Mr.Croyden, I
think I have met you in Northumberland.I'm glad, indeed, to see you
both."said Macloud, a little later, when they had finished
luncheon."I want to ask a slight favor--not political however--so it
won't have to be endorsed by the organization.""In that event, it is granted before you ask."Have the Secretary of the Navy issue us a permit to camp on Greenberry
Point.""Across the Severn River from Annapolis."Rickrose turned in his chair and glanced over the dining-room.Then he
raised his hand to the head waiter."Has the Secretary of the Navy had luncheon?""Yes, sir--before you came in.""We would better go over to the Department, at once, or we shall miss
him," he said."Chevy Chase is the drawing card, in the afternoon."The reception hour was long passed, but the Secretary was in and would
see Senator Rickrose.He came forward to meet him--a tall, middle-aged,
well-groomed man, with sandy hair, whose principal recommendation for
the post he filled was the fact that he was the largest contributor to
the campaign fund in his State, and his senior senator needed him in
his business, and had refrigerated him into the Cabinet for safe
keeping--that being the only job which insured him from being a
candidate for the Senator's own seat.said Rickrose, "my friends want a permit to camp for
two weeks on Greenberry Point."said the Secretary, vaguely--"that's somewhere out
in San Francisco harbor?""Not the Greenberry Point they mean," the Senator replied."It's down
at Annapolis--across the Severn from the Naval Academy, and forms part
of that command, I presume.It is waste land, unfortified and wind
swept."Why wouldn't the Superintendent give you a
permit?""We didn't think to ask him," said Macloud."We supposed it was
necessary to apply direct to you.""They are not familiar with the customs of the service," explained
Rickrose, "and, as I may run down to see them, just issue the permit to
me and party.The Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee is inspecting
the Point, if you need an excuse."none whatever--however, a duplicate will be forwarded to the
Superintendent.If it should prove incompatible with the interests of
the service," smiling, "he will inform the Department, and we shall
have to revoke it."He rang for his stenographer and dictated the permit.When it came in,
he signed it and passed it over to Rickrose."Anything else I can do for you, Senator?""Not to-day, thank you, Mr.asked Macloud, when they were in
the corridor.Hunting the Parmenter
treasure, with the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee as a
disinterested spectator, was rather startling, to say the least."The campaign opens next week, and I'm drawn as
a spell-binder in the Pacific States.That figurehead was ruffling his
feathers on you, just to show himself, so I thought I'd comb him down a
bit.If you do, wire me, and
I'll get busy.I've got to go over to the State Department now, so I'll
say good-bye--anything else you want let me know.""Next for a sporting goods shop," said Macloud as they went down the
steps into Pennsylvania Avenue; "for a supply of small arms and
ammunition--and, incidentally, a couple of tents.We can get a few
cooking utensils in Annapolis, but we will take our meals at Carvel
Hall.I think neither of us is quite ready to turn cook.""We can hire a horse and
buggy by the week, and keep them handy--better get a small tent for the
horse, while we're about it."They went to a shop on F Street, where they purchased three tents of
suitable size, two Winchester rifles, and a pair of Colt's military
revolvers with six-and-a-half inch barrels, and the necessary
ammunition.These they directed should be sent to Annapolis
immediately.Cots and blankets could be procured there, with whatever
else was necessary.They were bound up F Street, toward the Electric Station, when Macloud
broke out."If we had another man with us, your imprisonment idea would not be so
difficult--we could bag our game much more easily, and guard them more
securely when we had them.As it is, it's mighty puzzling to
arrange."said Croyden, "but where is the man who is
trustworthy--not to mention willing to take the risk, of being killed
or tried for murder, for someone else's benefit?They're not many like
you, Colin."A man, who was looking listlessly in a window just ahead, turned away.He bore an air of dejection, and his clothes, while well cut, were
beginning to show hard usage and carelessness.Macloud observed--"and on his uppers!""He is down hard, a little money
with a small divide, if successful, will get him.Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak or to go on.Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.Mighty kind in one who lost so much
through us.""You were not to blame--Royster's responsible, and he's gone----"

"To hell!""Meanwhile, can I do anything for
you?You're having a run of hard luck, aren't you?"For a moment, Axtell did not answer--he was gulping down his thoughts."I've just ten dollars to my name.I came here
thinking the Congressmen, who made piles through our office, would get
me something, but they gave me the marble stare.I was good enough to
tip them off and do favors for them, but they're not remembering me
now.Do you know where I can get a job?""Yes--I'll give you fifty dollars and board, if you will come with us
for two weeks."Will I take it?--Well, rather!""What you're to do, with Mr.Macloud and myself, we will disclose
later.If, then, you don't care to aid us, we must ask you to keep
silence about it.""I'll do my part, and ask
no questions--and thank you for trusting me.You're the first man since
our failure, who hasn't hit me in the face--don't you think I
appreciate it?"nodding toward
a small bag, which Axtell had in his hand."Then, come along--we're bound for Annapolis, and the car leaves in ten
minutes."X

PIRATE'S GOLD BREEDS PIRATE'S WAYS


That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment at Carvel Hall, they
took Axtell into their confidence--to a certain extent (though, again,
he protested his willingness simply to obey orders).They told him, in
a general way, of Parmenter's bequest, and how Croyden came to be the
legatee--saying nothing of its great value, however--its location, the
loss of the letter the previous evening, the episode of the thieves on
the Point, that morning, and their evident intention to return to the
quest."Now, what we want to know is: are you ready to help us--unaided by the
law--to seize these men and hold them prisoners, while we search for
the treasure?""We may be killed in the attempt, or we
may kill one or both of them, and have to stand trial if detected.If
you don't want to take the risk, you have only to decline--and hold
your tongue."said Axtell, "I don't want you to pay me a
cent--just give me my board and lodging and I'll gladly aid you as long
as necessary.It's a very little thing to do for one who has lost so
much through us.You provide for our defense, if we're apprehended by
the law, and _that_" (snapping his fingers) "for the risk.""We'll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you please," he said; "and, if
we recover what Parmenter buried, you'll not regret it."The following morning saw them down at the Point with the equipage and
other paraphernalia.The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis for
the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees, ditched them, received
their pay, climbed into the wagons and rumbled away to town--puzzled
that anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point when they had the
price of a hotel, and three square meals a day."It looks pretty good," said Croyden, when the canvases were up and
everything arranged--"and we shan't lack for the beautiful in nature.This is about the prettiest spot I've ever seen, the Chesapeake and the
broad river--the old town and the Academy buildings--the warships at
anchor--the _tout ensemble!_ We may not find the treasure, but, at
least, we've got a fine camp--though, I reckon, it is a bit breezy when
the wind is from the Bay.""I wonder if we should have paid our respects to the Superintendent
before poaching on his preserves?""Hum--hadn't thought of that!""Better go in and show
ourselves to him, this afternoon.He seems to be something of a
personage down here, and we don't want to offend him.These naval
officers, I'm told, are sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due
their rank.""On that score, we've got some rank
ourselves to uphold."the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, of the
United States Senate, is with us.According to the regulations, is it
his duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.""However, the Superintendent has a copy
of the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if
he's quiescent, it's up to us.""You should have been a diplomat,
Croyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!""A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to
Annapolis," he said."Look at the one cutting through the water there,
midway across!"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer
in uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put
about and went chugging upstream."We didn't seem to please him," remarked Macloud, gazing after the
boat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the
Experiment Station."We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet
either way," said Macloud."Otherwise, they wouldn't have
despatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As
soon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a
few steps forward to meet him."Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am
one of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr."The
Superintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself
and the Academy at your disposal."(He was instructed to add, that
Captain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to
Washington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we
appreciate his kindness exceedingly," Macloud answered."We're camping
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed."So far, we're making delightful progress," said Croyden; "but there
are breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our
absence."They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the
tools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit
to the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was
disclosed."Not very likely," replied Macloud, "with half a million at stake.They
probably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them
back again.""Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?""They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one
else.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is
like the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.""If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would
help some!""Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins
of the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel
last night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry
Point in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals
toward the ruins."What do you make the distance from the land?""About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over
water.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.""It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the
near side of the ruins," said Croyden."Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!""I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your
breakfast," answered Croyden."Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.""Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It
gives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain
figures.""Now, what's the rest
of the figures--or haven't you worked it out?""The calculation is of value only on the
assumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the
light-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now
three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing
ninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and
twenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three
and a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred
and ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and
a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the
Point, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.""Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet
Parmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore
line, instead of seven hundred and fifty!""As the Point from year to year slipped
into the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,
gradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since
Parmenter's beeches went down.""Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and
made a note of it on the letter?""Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,
likely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point
seemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large
trees to landward.""Next let us measure back eighty-five feet," said Croyden, producing a
tape-line.... "There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But
where were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them
intersect?"...said Macloud--"where were the trees, and where
did the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got
it?"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over."I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they
disclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,
it matters little where the others were, in determining the direction
of the treasure.The _objective point_ will
change as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_
will vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who
understand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we
are correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----"

He opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran
his eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he
glanced at Macloud and smiled."The treasure is buried," he repeated--"the treasure is buried--_out in
the Bay_.""Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult," he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low
bluff at the water's edge."Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here," he said, "and Parmenter
buried the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.""Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not
only encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.""It's hard to dig in water," Macloud remarked."It's apt to fill in the
hole, you know.""Don't be sarcastic," Croyden retorted."I'm not responsible for the
Bay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.""Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're
based," Macloud replied."And as the former seem to be accurate, and
the latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.""At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or
close on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the
entire Point.""You have given us a mighty plausible start," said Macloud.as a
buggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents."It is Hook-nose back again," said Macloud."Come to pay a social call,
I suppose!"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.""Come to treat with us--to share the treasure."By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,
immediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered
along landward."And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know
them," added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the
occupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the
horse over in front of them."Which of you men is named Croyden?""Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your
handle, isn't it?""You have the advantage of me," Croyden assured him."Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a
little private talk?"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and
continuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following."If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to
accommodate you," said the fellow."I thought, however, you'd rather
keep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,
all right, my friend!""Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,"
said Croyden."When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and
give them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,
with one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only
with small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before
they can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the
plea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with
impunity.""This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!""I would that I
were in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for
the war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can
just as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,
myself.""I can't," said Macloud."But there seem to be no rules to the game
we're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity."As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head
and got out."Leave it to me, I'll get them together," Croyden answered.... "You
wish to see me, privately?""I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not."said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was
pitched a trifle to one side.... "Now, sir, what is it?"as the flaps
dropped behind them."You've a business way about you, which I like----" began Hook-nose."Come to the point--what do
you want?""There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!"You lost a letter recently----"

"Not at all," Croyden cut in."I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,
are the thief.""I, or my pal--it matters not which," the fellow replied easily."Now,
what we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you've found it.""Well, let me tell you there won't
be any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I
don't agree with one."Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish."Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, "hitch the horse and come in."And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally
retired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their
backs to the entrance."I'm glad to make your acquaint----" began Smith."There is no need for an introduction," Croyden interrupted curtly."You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down
to business, if you please!""You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're
hell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that
this treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the
Government's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong
box--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own
flippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,
when the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.""Rather a good bargain for you," said Croyden."We supply the
information, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,
pray?""For our silence, and an equal share in the information.You have
doubtless forgot that we have the letter now.""Better
half a big loaf than no loaf at all.""I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know
it.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's
money belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States
land.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,
and the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!""If you're one to throw away good money, I miss
my guess.""I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill
might as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you
uncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget
that we come in for a share."His ears were
primed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--"Let us
have them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.""You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's
covered his pal.--Croyden cried--"None of that,
Hook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your
brains like chickenfeed."His own big revolver was sticking out of
Macloud's pocket."Now, I'll look after you, while my
friends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a
bullet down his throat.""Hands behind your back, Bald-head," commanded Axtell, briskly.Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on."Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!"Now, I'll do for you," Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.With Croyden's and Macloud's guns both covering him, the fellow was
quickly secured."With your permission, we will search you," said Croyden."Macloud, if
you will look to Mr.Smith, I'll attend to Hook-nose.We'll give them a
taste of their own medicine.""I don't care to shoot a prisoner, but I'll do
it without hesitation.It's going to be either perfect quiet or
permanent sleep--and you may do the choosing."He slowly went through Hook-nose's clothes--finding a small pistol,
several well-filled wallets, and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the
Parmenter letter.Macloud did the same for Bald-head."You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars from Mr.Macloud and
one hundred and eight from me," said Croyden."You may now have the
privilege of returning it, and the letter.If you make no more trouble,
lie quiet and take your medicine, you'll receive no further harm.If
you're stubborn, we'll either kill you and dump your bodies in the Bay,
or give you up to the police.The latter would be less trouble, for,
without the letter, you can tell your story to the Department, or
whomever else you please--it's your word against ours--and you are
thieves!""How long are you going to hold us prisoners?"asked Bald-head--"till
you find the treasure?"And luck is with you," Hook-nose sneered."At present, it _is_ with us--very much with us, my friend," said
Croyden."You will excuse us, now, we have pressing business,
elsewhere."When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:

"Doesn't our recovery of Parmenter's letter change things very
materially?""It seems to me it does," Croyden answered."Indeed, I think we need
fear the rogues no longer--we can simply have them arrested for the
theft of our wallets, or even release them entirely.""Arrest is preferable," said Macloud."It will obviate all danger of
our being shot at long range, by the beggars.Let us put them where
they're safe, for the time.""But the arrest must not be made here!""We can't
send for the police: if they find them here it would give color to
their story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.""Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while you go to town and
arrange for their apprehension--say, just as they come off the Severn
bridge."What if they don't cross the Severn--what if they scent our game, and
keep straight on to Baltimore?They can abandon their team, and catch a
Short Line train at a way station.""Then the Baltimore police can round them up.They've lost Parmenter's letter; haven't anything to substantiate their
story.Furthermore, we have a permit for the Chairman of the Naval
Affairs Committee and friends to camp here.I think that, now, we can
afford to ignore them--the recovery of the letter was exceedingly
lucky."said Macloud--"you're the one to be satisfied; it's a
whole heap easier than running a private prison ourselves."Croyden looked the other's horse over carefully, so he could describe
it accurately, then they hitched up their own team and he drove off to
Annapolis."I told the Mayor we had passed two men on
the Severn bridge whom we identified as those who picked our pockets,
Wednesday evening, in Carvel Hall--and gave him the necessary
descriptions.He recognized the team as one of 'Cheney's Best,' and
will have the entire police force--which consists of four men--waiting
at the bridge on the Annapolis side.""They are
there, now, so we can turn the prisoners loose."Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers, and returned to the
tent--to be greeted with a volley of profanity which, for fluency and
vocabulary, was distinctly marvelous.Gradually, it died away--for want
of breath and words."In the cuss line, you two are the real
thing.Why didn't you open up sooner?--you shouldn't hide such
proficiency from an admiring world."Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.Bald-head, however,
remained quiet, and there was a faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he
caught the humor of the situation.They were severely cramped, and in
considerable pain, but their condition was not likely to be benefited
by swearing at their captors.said Croyden, as Hook-nose took a fresh start.Now, if you'll be quiet a moment, like
your pal, we will tell you something that possibly you'll not be averse
to hear.... So, that's better.We're about to release you--let you go
free; it's too much bother to keep you prisoners.These little toy guns
of yours, however, we shall throw into the Bay, in interest of the
public peace.Now, you may arise and shake yourselves--you'll, likely,
find the circulation a trifle restricted, for a few minutes."Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made no reply, Bald-head
grinned broadly."Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will escort you to your
carriage!And with the two thieves in front, and the three revolvers bringing up
the rear, they proceeded to the buggy.XI

ELAINE CAVENDISH


"May we have seen the last of you!"said Macloud, as the buggy
disappeared among the trees; "and may the police provide for you in
future.""And while you're about it," said Croyden, "you might pray that we find
the treasure--it would be quite as effective."Now, to resume where those rogues interrupted us.We had the jewels located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.They must be, according to our theory, either on the bank or in the
Bay.We can't go at the water without a boat.Shall we tackle the land
at once?or go to town and procure a boat, and be ready for either in
the morning.""I have an idea," said Macloud."Don't let it go to waste, old man, let's have it!""If you can give up hearing yourself talk, for a moment, I'll try!""It is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point
by day may, probably will, provoke comment and possibly investigation
as well.Then as soon as dusky
Night has drawn her robes about her----"

"Oh, Lord!"ejaculated Croyden, with upraised hands."Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her robes about her," Macloud
repeated, imperturbably, "we set to work, by the light of the silvery
moon.We arouse no comment--provoke no investigation.When morning
dawns, the sands are undisturbed, and we are sleeping as peacefully as
guinea pigs.""And if there isn't a moon, we will set to work by the light of the
silvery lantern, I reckon!""And, when we tackle the water, it will be in a silver boat and with
silver cuirasses and silver helmets, a la Lohengrin.""And I suppose, our swan-song will be played on silver flutes!""There won't be a swan-song--we're going to find Parmenter's treasure,"
said Macloud.Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town, stopping at the North end
of the Severn bridge to hire a row-boat,--a number of which were drawn
up on the bank--and to arrange for it to be sent around to the far end
of the Point.At the hotel, they found a telephone call from the
Mayor's office awaiting them.The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor said, and they had been
sent to Baltimore.The Chief of Detectives happened to be in the
office, when they were brought in, and had instantly recognized them as
well-known criminals, wanted in Philadelphia for a particularly
atrocious hold-up.He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief
take them back with him, thus saving the County the cost of a trial,
and the penitentiary expense--as well as sparing Mr.Croyden and his
friend much trouble and inconvenience in attending court.He had had
them searched, but found nothing which could be identified.Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.That night, and every night for the
next three weeks, they kept at it.They dug up the entire zone
of suspicion--it being loose sand and easy to handle.On the plea that
a valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while fishing, they
dragged and scraped the bottom of the Bay for a hundred yards around.Nothing smiled on them but the weather--it had
remained uniformly good until the last two days before.Then there had
set in, from the North-east, such a storm of rain as they had never
seen.The very Bay seemed to be gathered up and dashed over the Point.They had sought refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of
wind and water came up the Chesapeake.As it grew fiercer,--and a <DW64>
sent out for information returned with the news that their tents had
been blown away, and all trace of the camp had vanished--it was
decided that the quest should be abandoned."We knew from the first it
couldn't succeed.""But we wanted to prove that it couldn't succeed," Macloud observed."If you hadn't searched, you always would have thought that, maybe, you
could have been successful.Now, you've had your try--and you've
failed.It will be easier to reconcile yourself to failure, than not to
have tried.""In other words, it's better to have tried and lost, than never to have
tried at all," Croyden answered.it's over and there's no profit
in thinking more about it.We have had an enjoyable camp, and the camp
is ended.I'll go home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel box
he buried down on Greenberry Point.""I think I'll go with you," said Macloud."To Hampton--if you can put up with me a little longer."A knowing smile broke over Croyden's face."Maybe!--and maybe it is just you.At any rate, I'll come if I may."You know you're more than welcome, always!""I'll go out to Northumberland to-night, arrange a few
matters which are overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I can
get away."*       *       *       *       *

The next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the wide doorway of the
Tuscarora Trust Company, he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.There isn't a handy dinner man around, with you and Geoffrey
both away.Dine with us this evening, will you?--it will be strictly
_en famille_, for I want to talk business."he thought, as, having accepted, he went on
to the coupon department."It has to do with that beggar Croyden, I
reckon."*       *       *       *       *

And when, the dinner over, they were sitting before the open grate
fire, in the big living room, she broached the subject without
timidity, or false pride."You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden's affairs than any one
else, Colin," she said, crossing her knees, in the reckless fashion
women have now-a-days, and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue silk
stockings, with an unconscious consciousness that was delightfully
naive."And I want to ask you something--or rather, several things."Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into the fire, and waited."I, naturally, don't ask you to violate any confidence," she went on,
"but I fancy you may tell me this: was the particular business in which
Geoffrey was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success or a
failure?""Did he tell you anything concerning
it?""Only that his return to Northumberland would depend very much on the
outcome.""Well, it wasn't a success; in fact, it was a complete failure.""I do not mean, where is he this minute, but where
is he in general--where would you address a wire, or a letter, and know
that it would be received?"He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit another."I am not at liberty to tell," he said."Then, it is true--he is concealing himself.""Not exactly--he is not proclaiming himself----"

"Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts to his Northumberland
friends, you mean?""Are there such things as friends, when one
has been unfortunate?""I can answer only for myself," she replied earnestly."I believe you, Elaine----"

"Then tell me this--is he in this country or abroad?""In this country," he said, after a pause."Is he in want,--I mean, in want for the things he has been used to?""He is not in want, I can assure you!--and much that he was used to
having, he has no use for, now."Why did he leave Northumberland so suddenly?"He was forced to give up the old life, so he chose
wisely, I think--to go where his income was sufficient for his needs."She was silent for a while, staring into the blaze.He did not
interrupt--thinking it wise to let her own thoughts shape the way."You will not tell me where he is?"she said suddenly, bending her blue
eyes hard upon his face.I ought not to have told you he was not abroad.""This business which you and he were on, in Annapolis--it failed, you
say?""And is there no chance that it may succeed, some time?""But may not conditions change--something happen----" she began."It is the sort that does not happen.In this case, abandonment spells
finis.""Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?""On the contrary, he was very sanguine--it looked most promising
then."He blew ring after ring of smoke, and
waited, patiently.He was the friend, he saw, now.Croyden was the lucky fellow--and would not!Well, he had
his warning and it was in time.Since she was baring her soul to him,
as friend to friend, it was his duty to help her to the utmost of his
power.Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up."I have bought all the stock, and the remaining bonds of the Virginia
Development Company, from the bank that held them as collateral for
Royster & Axtell's loan," she said.I didn't
appear in the matter--my broker bought them in _your_ name, and paid
for them in actual money."She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him on the cheek."I am, also, Geoffrey Croyden's friend, but
there are temptations which mortal man cannot resist."she smiled, leaning over the back of his chair, and
putting her head perilously close to his--"but I trust you--though I
shan't kiss you again--at least, for the present.Now, you have been so
_very_ good about the bonds, I want you to be good some more.He held his hands before him, to put them out of temptation."Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how quickly I do it!""It might prove my power, but I should lose my friend," she whispered.it's
already granted, that you should know, Elaine.""You're a very sweet boy," she said, going back to her seat.But that you're a very sweet girl, needs no
proof--unless----" looking at her with a meaning smile."I should accept it as such," he averred--"whenever you choose to
confer it.""_Confer_ smacks of reward for service done," she said."Will it bide
till then?""Wait--If you choose such pay, the----"

"I choose no pay," he interrupted."Then, the reward will be in kind," she answered enigmatically."I want
you----" She put one slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it,
meditatively, while the firelight stole covert glances at the silken
ankles thus exposed."I want you to purchase for me, from Geoffrey
Croyden, at par, his Virginia Development Company bonds," she said.I will give you a check, now----"

"Wait!"he said; "wait until he sells----"

"You think he won't sell?""I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as to the purchaser--in
plain words, that it isn't either you or I. We can't give Geoffrey
money!The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows only too
well.""I had thought of that," she said, "but, isn't it met by this very
plan?Your broker purchases the bonds for your account, but he,
naturally, declines to reveal the identity of his customer.You can,
truthfully, tell Geoffrey that _you_ are not buying them--for you're
not.And _I_--if he will only give me the chance--will assure him that
I am _not_ buying them from him--and you might confirm it, if he
asked."It's juggling with the facts--though true on the face," said
Macloud, "but it's pretty thin ice we're skating on."He may take the two hundred
thousand and ask no question.""You don't for a moment believe that!""It _is_ doubtful," she admitted."And you wouldn't think the same of him, if he did.""So, we are back to the thin ice.I'll do what I can; but, you forgot,
I am not at liberty to give his address to my brokers.I shall have to
take their written offer to buy, and forward it to him, which, in
itself will oblige me, at the same time, to tell him that _I_ am not
the purchaser.""I leave it entirely to you--manage it any way you see fit.All I ask,
is that you get him to sell.It's horrible to think of Geoffrey being
reduced to the bare necessities of life--for that's what it means, when
he goes 'where his income is sufficient for his needs.'""It's unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly worse for a woman--to
go from luxury to frugality, from everything to relatively nothing is
positively pathetic.However, Croyden is not suffering--he has an
attractive house filled with old things, good victuals, a more than
competent cook, and plenty of society.He has cut out all the
non-essentials, and does the essentials economically.""You speak of your own knowledge,
not from his inferences?""Our own in the aggregate
or differentiated?"he laughed; "but quite the equal of our own
differentiated.If Croyden were a marrying man--with sufficient income
for two--I should give him about six months, at the outside.""And how much would you give one with sufficient for two--_yourself_,
for instance?""Just long enough to choose the girl--and convince her of the propriety
of the choice.""And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?""As soon as I can get through here,--probably in a day or two.""Then, we may look for the new Mrs.Macloud in time for the holidays, I
presume.--Sort of a Christmas gift?""About then--if I can pick among so many, and she ratifies the pick.""No!--there are so many I didn't have time to more than look them over.When I go back, I'll round them up, cut out the most likely, and try to
tie and brand her.""One would think, from your talk, that
Geoffrey was in a cowboy camp, with waitresses for society."He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette."And nothing can induce you to tell me the location of the camp?""Let us try the bond matter, first.If
he sells, I think he will return; if not, I'll then consider telling.""You're a good fellow, Colin, dear!"she whispered, leaning over and
giving his hand an affectionate little pat."You're so nice and
comfortable to have around--you never misunderstand, nor draw
inferences that you shouldn't.""Which means, I'm not to draw inferences now?""Nor at any other time," she remarked."Will be forthcoming," with an alluring smile."I've a mind to take part payment now," said he, intercepting the hand
before she could withdraw it.whisking it loose, and darting around a table.With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts and fled--around chairs,
and tables, across rugs, over sofas and couches--always manoeuvring to
gain the doorway, yet always finding him barring the way;--until, at
last, she was forced to refuge behind a huge davenport, standing with
one end against the wall.he demanded, coming slowly toward her in the
cul de sac."I'll be merciful," he said."It is five steps, until I reach
you--One!--Will you yield?""Four----"

Quick as thought, she dropped one hand on the back of the davenport;
there was a flash of slippers, lingerie and silk, and she was across
and racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving him only the echo
of a mocking laugh.she counted, tauntingly, from the hall."Why don't you
continue, sir?""I'll be good for to-night, Elaine--you
need have no further fear."She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a bantering look came into
her eyes."I'm not much afraid of you, now--nor any time," she answered."But you
have more courage than I would have thought, Colin--decidedly more!"XII

ONE LEARNED IN THE LAW


It was evening, when Croyden returned to Hampton--an evening which
contained no suggestion of the Autumn he had left behind him on the
Eastern Shore.It was raw, and damp, and chill, with the presage of
winter in its cold; the leaves were almost gone from the trees, the
blackening hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery.As he passed up
the dreary, deserted street, the wind was whistling through the
branches over head, and moaning around the houses like spirits of the
damned.He turned in at Clarendon--shivering a little at the prospect.He was
beginning to appreciate what a winter spent under such conditions
meant, where one's enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed by the
bounds of comparatively few houses and few people--people, he
suspected, who could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly
of life and amusement, even if they tried.Their ways were sufficient
for them; they were eminently satisfied with what they had; they could
not comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and would have no patience
with it.He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton, when contrasted with the
brightness of Northumberland.The theatres, the clubs, the constant
dinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with all that it
comprehended, compared with an occasional dinner, a rare party,
interminable evenings spent, by his own fireside, alone!To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden, and Miss Lashiel, and
Miss Tilghman, would be available, when they were home.But the winter
was when they went visiting, he remembered, from late November until
early April, and, at that period, the town saw them but little.There
was the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse than nothing--an
opportunity to get mellow and to gamble, innocent enough to those who
were habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had fallen, by
adversity, from better things....

However, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank God!And the dear girls
were not going for a week or so, he hoped.And, when the worst came, he
could retire to the peacefulness of his library and try to eke out a
four months' existence, with the books, and magazines and papers.Moses held open the door, with a bow and a flourish, and the lights
leaped out to meet him.It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a
bright house, a full larder, faithful servants--and supper ready on the
table, and tuned to even a Clubman's taste."Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington's at home?"he asked, the coffee
on and his cigar lit.her am home, seh, I seed she herse'f dis mornin' cum down
de parf from de front poach wid de dawg, seh."Croyden nodded and went across the hall to the telephone.Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.--Yes, she intended to be
home all evening.She would be delighted to see him and to hear a full
account of himself.He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in finishing his cigar and
changing his clothes--and he wondered whether it was the girl, or the
companionship, or the opportunity to be free of himself?A little of
all three, he concluded.... But, especially, the _girl_, as she came
from the drawing-room to meet him."So you have really returned," she said, as he bowed over her slender
fingers."We were beginning to fear you had deserted us.""You are quite too modest," he replied."You don't appreciate your own
attractions."The "you" was plainly singular, but she refused to see it."Our own attractions require us to be modest," she returned; "with
a--man of the world.""Whatever I may have been, I am, now, a man of
Hampton.""You can never be a man of Hampton.""Why not, if I live among you?""If you live here--take on our ways, our beliefs, our mode of thinking,
you may, in a score of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,
where the true like must start, _never_!"You've been bred differently, used to
different things, to doing them in a different way.We do things
slowly, leisurely, with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern
rush, and bustle, and hurry.You are a man of the world--I repeat
it--up to the minute in everything--never lagging behind, unless you
wish.You never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.We never
do anything to-day that can be put off till to-morrow.""And which do you prefer, the to-day or the to-morrow?""It depends on my humor, and my location, at the time--though, I must
admit, the to-day makes for thrift, and business, and success in
acquiring wealth.""And success also in getting rid of it.It is a return toward the
primitive condition--the survival of the fittest.There must be losers
as well as acquirers."she exclaimed, "that one must lose in order
that another may gain.""But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria," he smiled, "it will continue
so to be.Why, even in Baltimore, they----"

"Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country town!""With half a million population, it is as
provincial as Hampton, and thanks God for it--the most smug,
self-satisfied, self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its
cobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou
air about everything.""Because it happens to be on the main line between Washington and the
North.""At least, the people are nice, barring a few mushrooms who are making
a great to-do.""Yes, the people _are_ delightful!--And, when it comes to mushrooms,
Northumberland has Baltimore beaten to a frazzle."Northumberland society must be exceedingly large!""It is--but it's not overcrowded.About as many die every day, as are
born every night; and, at any rate, they don't interfere with those who
really belong--except to increase prices, and the cost of living, and
clog the avenue with automobiles."but whither it leads no one knows--to the devil,
likely--or a lemon garden.""'Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they shall be peaches in
Heaven!'""What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will be," he replied."I'm afraid you don't appreciate the great honor the lady did you, in
condescending to view the _treasures_ of Clarendon, and to talk about
them afterward.To hear her, she is the most intimate friend you have
in Hampton."he said, "I'm glad you told me.Somehow, I'm always drawing
lemons.""Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A lemon or not a lemon?""If you could but see yourself at this moment, you would not ask," he
said, looking at her with amused scrutiny.The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine figure in the simple
pink organdie, the slender ankles, the well-shod feet--a lemon!"But as I can't see myself, and have no mirror handy, your testimony is
desired," she insisted."Then you can't have any objection----"

"If you bring Miss Erskine in?""----if I take you there for a game of Bridge--shall we go this very
evening?""I don't wish--and we are growing very silly.Come, tell
about your Annapolis trip."It's a queer old town, Annapolis--they call it the 'Finished City!'It's got plenty of landmarks, and relics, but nothing more.If it were
not for the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would be only a lot of
ruins, lost in the sand.No one on
the streets, no one in the shops, no one any place.--Deserted--until
there's a fire."But, with the
autumn and the Academy in session, the town seemed very much alive.We
sampled 'Cheney's Best,' Wegard's Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream
Chapel.""You've been to Annapolis, sure!""There's only one thing
more--did you see Paul Jones?"You can't find him without the aid of a
detective or a guide.""No one!--and there is the shame.We accepted the vast labors and the
money of our Ambassador to France in locating the remains of America's
first Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy and a warship to bring them back;
we received them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over them.And then, when the spectators had departed--assuming they were to be
deposited in the crypt of the Chapel--we calmly chucked them away on a
couple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft Hall, as we would an
old broom or a tin can.That's _our_ way of honoring the only Naval
Commander we had in the Revolution.It would have been better, much
better, had we left him to rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in
France--lost, save in memory, with the halo of the past and privacy of
death around him.""And why didn't we finish the work?""Why bring him here,
with the attendant expense, and then stop, just short of completion?Why didn't we inter him in the Chapel (though, God save me from burial
there), or any place, rather than on trestles under a stairway in a
midshipmen's dormitory?""Because the appropriation was exhausted, or because the Act wasn't
worded to include burial, or because the Superintendent didn't want the
bother, or because it was a nuisance to have the remains around--or
some other absurd reason.At all events, he is there in the cellar, and
he is likely to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up by the
Bay.The junket to France, the parade, the speeches, the spectacular
part are over, so, who cares for the entombment, and the respect due
the distinguished dead?""I don't mean to be disrespectful," he observed, "but it's hard luck to
have one's bones disturbed, after more than a hundred years of
tranquillity, to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be orated
over, and sermonized over, and, then, to be flung aside like old junk
and forgot.However, we have troubles of our own--I know I have--more
real than Paul Jones!He may be glad he's dead, so he won't have any to
worry over.In fact, it's a good thing to be dead--one is saved from a
heap of worry.""A daily struggle to procure fuel sufficient
to keep up the fire."Why not make an end of life, at once?""Sometimes, I'm tempted," he admitted."It's the leap in the dark, and
no returning, that restrains, I reckon--and the fact that we must face
it alone.You have
begged the question, or what amounts to it.But, to return to
Annapolis; what else did you see?""Then you know what I saw," he replied.This isn't the day of the rapier and the mask."She half closed her eyes and looked at him through the long lashes."What were you doing down on Greenberry Point?"I was in Annapolis--I saw your name on the
register--I inquired--and I had the tale of the camp.No one, however,
seemed to think it queer!"Camping out is entirely natural," Croyden answered."With the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs?""A party which until five days ago he had not joined--at least, so the
Superintendent told me, when I dined at his house.He happened to
mention your name, found I knew you--and we gossiped.Perhaps we
shouldn't, but we did."he didn't seem even to wonder at your being there----"

"But _you_ did?""It's the small town in me, I suppose--to be curious about other people
and their business; and it was most suspicious."First, you hire a boat and cross the Bay direct from
Hampton to Annapolis.Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose, a
permit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp on Greenberry Point.Third, you actually do camp, there, for nearly, or quite three weeks.Why go clear to the Western Shore, and choose a
comparatively inaccessible and exposed location on United States
property, if the idea were only a camp?Why not camp over on Kent
Island, or on this coast?Anywhere, within a few miles of Hampton,
there are scores of places better adapted than Greenberry Point."With a series of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion
you wish--you're not bound by the probabilities.""You're simply obscuring the point," she insisted."In this instance,
my premises are facts which are not controverted.Why?----" She held up her hand.I'm simply
'chaffing of you,' don't you know!""With just a lingering curiosity, however," he added."A casual curiosity, rather," she amended."Which, some time, I shall gratify.You've trailed me down--we _were_
on Greenberry Point for a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet--and
it's likely a failure."Croyden, I don't wish to know.It was a mistake to refer
to it.I should simply have forgot what I heard in Annapolis--I'll
forget now, if you will permit."You can't forget, if you would--and I
would not have you, if you could.Moreover, I inherited it along with
Clarendon, and, as you were my guide to the place, it's no more than
right that you should know.I think I shall confide in you--no use to
protest, it's got to come!""You are determined?--Very well, then, come over to the couch in the
corner, where we can sit close and you can whisper."She put out her hand and led him--and he
suffered himself to be led.when they were seated, "you may begin.Once upon a time----" and
laughed, softly."I'll take this, if you've no immediate use for it,"
she said, and released her hand from his."I shall want it back, presently, however.""Do you, by any chance, get all you want?"Else I would have kept what I already had."She put her hands behind her, and faced around."Well,--once upon a time----" Then he stopped."I'll go over to the
house and get the letter--it will tell you much better than I can.You
will wait here, _right here_, until I return?"She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile."Won't it be enough, if I am here _when_ you return?"When he came out on the piazza the rain had ceased, the clouds were
gone, the temperature had fallen, and the stars were shining brightly
in a winter sky.He strode quickly down the walk to the street and crossed it diagonally
to his own gates.As he passed under the light, which hung near the
entrance, a man walked from the shadow of the Clarendon grounds and
accosted him.Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance."With your permission, I will accompany you to your house--to which I
assume you are bound--for a few moments' private conversation."He was about thirty years of age, tall
and slender, was well dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight
top-coat, and a derby hat.His face was ordinary, however, and Croyden
had no recollection of ever having seen it--certainly not in Hampton."I'm not in the habit of discussing business with strangers, at night,
nor of taking them to my house," he answered, brusquely."If you have
anything to say to me, say it now, and be brief."Some one may hear us," the man objected."Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you would have objection.""You'll say it quickly, and here, or not at all," snapped Croyden."It's scarcely a subject to be discussed on the street," he observed,
"but, if I must, I must.Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter?Well, the business concerns a certain letter--need I
be more explicit?""If you wish to make your business intelligible.""As you wish," he said, "though it only consumes time, and I was under
the impression that you were in a hurry.However: To repeat--the
business concerns a letter, which has to do with a certain treasure
buried long ago, on Greenberry Point, by the said Robert Parmenter.Do
I make myself plain, now, sir?""Your language is entirely intelligible--though I cannot answer for the
facts recited."The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:

"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,
with two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that
would deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then
departed, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of
weather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to
communicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up."Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was
not ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure."Croyden only smiled, and waited, too."Very good!--we will proceed," said the stranger."The jewels were
found on Government land.It makes no difference whether recovered on
the Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am
informed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,
it being the owner in fee of the land.""I have devoted my spare moments to the study of
the law----"

"And how to avoid it," Croyden interjected."And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it," he replied,
suggestively."Let us take up that phase, if it please you."asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination
to laugh."Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find
to the Government.""We are arriving, now, at the pith of the
matter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and
multiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in
valuation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million
dollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share."Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?""If you prefer blackmail to
share, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as
illegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better
but either obtains the same end.Call it what you
will--but _pay_.""If you are not familiar
with the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten
you.""I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly," the stranger
replied, refusing to be hurried or flustered."The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on
Government land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If
declared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as
the Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed
on, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,
you have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further
deductions.""No!--it's quite unnecessary," Croyden remarked."Your fellow thieves
went into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,
almost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the
conversation.""I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,
you have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be
essential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's
testimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as
you are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.""There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but
which is, unfortunately, not a fact," said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly."We don't ask you to acknowledge the
finding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget
everything.""My good man, I'm speaking the truth!""Maybe it's
difficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I
only wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share
it, even with a blackmailer!""I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you."And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to
Clarendon.XII

I COULD TELL SOME THINGS


When Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the
escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only
a little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain
in attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held
him.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy
with the sleep from which he had been aroused."Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?""Fur de Lawd, seh!Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se
gun-shy, seh.""Yass, seh, I has don hit.""And you could do it again, if necessary?""I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,
seh, mons'us unsuttin!""Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?""Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you
know enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.""Hi!--I sut'n'y does!seh, I sut'n'y does!"said the <DW64>, with a
broad grin."There is a revolver, yonder, on the table," said Croyden, indicating
one of those they used on Greenberry Point."It's a self-cocker--you
simply pull the trigger and the action does the rest."Yass, seh, I onderstands," said Moses."Bring it here," Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried
it to his master."I'll show you the action," said Croyden."Here, is the ejector,"
throwing the chamber out, "it holds six shots, you see: but you never
put a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the
trigger, it's likely to be discharged."Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,
who took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty
years, and more."What do yo warn me to do, seh?""I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to
get in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to
Captain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely
you will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even
if you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once."Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.""You're to shoot anyone who tries to
_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any
one else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang
away.""Sut'n'y, seh!I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang
away right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?"Croyden smiled--"but you be ready for them, Moses, be
ready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies."as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,
"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'
likes hit, dat's whar I don'."Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick
return to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the
hall."I had a mind not to wait here," she said; "you were an inordinately
long time, Mr."I was, and I admit
it--but it can be explained.""Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!"said
he, and gave her the letter."Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing
in a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,
she turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden."Most extraordinary in its
ordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?""Now, I'll tell you about it.""First, tell me where you obtained this letter?""I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at
Clarendon," he answered."This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find
it!"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of
the letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode
of the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the
thieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together
with the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the
well-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not
interrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she
break the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring
thoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back
log glowed fitfully."What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?"In the
words of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!""But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the
treasure," she objected."Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the
least.""He is not acting alone," she persisted."He has confederates--they may
attack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure."this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!""We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.""Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways!""Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this
connection.""Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and
tortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?""However, I
put Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting
up the neighborhood.""Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!""Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as
vaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being
tortured.""You know best, I suppose," she said--"but you've had your warning--and
pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding
the treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?""Possibly half a million," he filled in."If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I
shall be only too glad to consider it.""You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?""And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?"She puckered her brows in thought.He regarded her with an amused
smile."I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again," she
announced--"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a
second, or a third, or even many seekings.""If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend
a lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the
extreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made
the best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of
exploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we
failed.It will make nothing for success to try again.""Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred
feet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been
eaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared
with the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,
except by accident.""Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she
handed it back, and shook her head."It's too much for my poor brain," she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,
and, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall
return the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it."You can return it to its hiding place," she reflected, "but you can't
cease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the
landmarks were there?"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left
until the 'extremity of need.'""Probably," she said, "the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor
to observe the exact terms of the bequest."It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!""You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!"And with all that money, the Duvals
might have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other
conditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might
have never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!"In the realm of pure conjecture," he answered."It is idle to theorize
on the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the
what-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I
have consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something
else.What have you been doing in those three weeks?"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,
with an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,
and I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression
you had made!""We both were learning, it seems," he replied."I don't quite understand," she said."You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but
this impression is much more than the ordinary kind!"_"Merci, Monsieur_," she scoffed."No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on
whom to make an impression.""You mean, Mr.--Macloud?""For he's coming back----"

"To Hampton?""To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.""I shall believe you, when I see him!""He is, I think, coming solely on your account.""But you're not quite sure?--oh!"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.""So you're confiding in me--how clever!""I could tell some things----"

"Which are fables.""----but I won't--they might turn your head----"

"Which way--to the right or left?""----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but
twice----"

"Once!""Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave
you a name, the instant he saw you----"

"How kind of him!""He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'""Was that the first time you had noticed it?""No, you most assuredly do not!"she said, "I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!""Because, it would be false to your friend."Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.""At least, I so view it," with a teasingly fascinating smile."Don't you think that you protest over-much?""If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't
you?'""And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'""Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr."I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say
that you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than
enough for two, I can assure you.""And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?""What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?""I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens," he insisted."If it will advantage any----"

"I didn't say so," she interrupted.

"----I can tell you----"

"Many fables, I don't doubt!"----that we have been rather intimate, for a few years, and I have
never before known him to exhibit particular interest in any woman.""'Why don't you speak for yourself, John,'" she quoted, merrily."Because, to be frank, I haven't enough for two," he answered, gayly.But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected the faintest note of
regret.And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered about her--whether she
was dark or fair, tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor--and whether they loved each other--or whether it
was he, alone, who loved--or whether he had not permitted himself to be
carried so far--or whether--then, she dropped asleep.Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp look-out for anyone
under the trees around the house.He found Moses in the library,
evidently just aroused from slumber by the master's door key."No one's bin heah, seh, 'cep de boy wid dis'spatch," he hastened to
say.Croyden tore open the envelope:--It was a wire from Macloud, that he
would be down to-morrow.yass, seh!--I'se pow'ful glad yo's back, seh.Nothin' I kin
git yo befo I goes?""You're a good soldier, Moses, you didn't
sleep on guard."I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden, wide awake all de time,
seh.Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light, and went slowly
upstairs--giving not a thought to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he
had met outside.His mind was busy with Elaine Cavendish--their last
night on the moonlit piazza--the brief farewell--the lingering pressure
of her fingers--the light in her eyes--the subdued pleasure, when they
met unexpectedly in Annapolis--her little ways to detain him, keep him
close to her--her instant defense of him at Mattison's scurrilous
insinuation--the officers' hop--the rhythmic throb of the melody--the
scented, fluttering body held close in his arms--the lowered head--the
veiled eyes--the trembling lashes--his senses steeped in the fragrance
of her beauty--the temptation well-nigh irresistible--his resolution
almost gone--trembling--trembling----

                  *       *       *       *       *

The vision passed--music ceased--the dance was ended.Sentiment
vanished--reason reigned once more.to think of her, to dream of the past, even.But
it is pleasant, sometimes, to be a fool--where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one's self to pay the piper.XIV

THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE


Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for his host a great batch of
mail, which had accumulated at the Club."I thought of it at the last moment--when I was starting for the
station, in fact," he remarked."The clerk said he had no instructions
for forwarding, so I just poked it in my bag and brought it along.Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.I
can understand why you didn't leave an address, but not why I shouldn't
forward it.""I didn't care, when I left--and I don't care much, now--but I'm
obliged, just the same!""It's something to do; the most
exciting incident of the day, down here, is the arrival of the mail.The people wait for it, with bated breath.I am getting in the way,
too, though I don't get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland--so this is just circulars and
such trash."He took the package, which Macloud handed him, and tossed it on the
desk.Everybody is
back--everybody is hard up or says he is--everybody is full of lies,
as usual, and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.It's the telling,
not the believing that's the thing.the little cad Mattison is
engaged--Charlotte Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.""I don't envy her the job," Croyden remarked."She'll be privileged to draw
on his bank account, and that's the all important thing with her.He
will fracture the seventh commandment, and she won't turn a hair.She
is a chilly proposition, all right.""Well, I wish her joy of her bargain," said Croyden."May she have
everything she wants, and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey--and but very occasionally, then."He took up the letters and ran carelessly through them.he commented, as he consigned them, one by one,
to the waste-basket.Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his cigar smoke, and made no
comment.Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope--darkened on the
interior so as to prevent the contents from being read until opened.It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in Northumberland."'We own and offer, subject to
prior sale, the following high grade investment bonds.'He drew out the letter and looked at it,
perfunctorily, before sending it to rest with its fellows.--It wasn't
in the usual form.--He opened it, wider.--It was signed by the senior
partner.Croyden:

  "We have a customer who is interested in the Virginia Development
  Company.He has purchased the Bonds and the stock of Royster &
  Axtell, from the bank which held them as collateral.He is
  willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without any accrued
  interest, however.If you will consent to sell, the Company can
  proceed without reorganization but, if you decline, he will
  foreclose under the terms of the mortgage.We have suggested the
  propriety and the economy to him--since he owns or controls all
  the stock--of not purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told
  him it is worse than bad business to do so.But he refuses to be
  advised, insisting that he must be the sole owner, and that he is
  willing to submit to the additional expense rather than go
  through the tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale.We are
  prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds attached, or to
  pay cash on presentation and transfer.We shall be obliged for a
  prompt reply."Yours very truly,

                                              "R. J."What the devil!----"

He read it a second time.No, he wasn't asleep--it was all there,
typewritten and duly signed.Two hundred thousand dollars!--honor sight
draft, or pay cash on presentation and transfer!Then he passed it across to Macloud."Read this aloud, will you,--I want to see if I'm quite sane!"Macloud was at his favorite occupation--blowing smoke rings through one
another, and watching them spiral upward toward the ceiling.he said, as Croyden's words roused him from his
meditation.He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on that letter, trying to
explain the reason for the purchase, and the foolishly high price they
were offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden."It is typewritten, you haven't a chance to get wrong!"he exclaimed.... "So, I wasn't crazy: and either
Blaxham is lying or his customer needs a guardian--which is it?""I don't see that it need concern you, in the least, which it is," said
Macloud."Be grateful for the offer--and accept by wireless or any
other way that's quicker.""But the bonds aren't worth five cents on the dollar!""So much the more reason to hustle the deal through.You may have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.""There's something queer about that
letter."Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled."Blaxham's customer
may have the willies--indeed, he as much as intimates that such is the
case--but, thank God!we're not obliged to have a commission-in-lunacy
appointed on everybody who makes a silly stock or bond purchase.If we
were, we either would have no markets, or the courts would have time
for nothing else.take what the gods have given you
and be glad.You can return to
Northumberland, resume the old life, and be happy ever after;--or you
can live here, and there, and everywhere.You're unattached--not even a
light-o'-love to squander your money, and pester you for gowns and
hats, and get in a hell of a temper--and be false to you, besides.""No, I haven't one of them, thank God!""I've got
troubles enough of my own."It clears some of them away--if I take it."man, you're not thinking, seriously, of refusing?""It will put me on 'easy street,'" Croyden observed."And it comes with remarkable timeliness--so timely, indeed, as to be
suspicious.""It's a bona fide offer--there's no trouble on that score.""This," said Croyden: "I'm broke--finally.The Parmenter treasure is
moonshine, so far as I'm concerned.I'm down on my uppers, so to
speak--my only assets are some worthless bonds.along comes an
offer for them at par--two hundred thousand dollars for nothing!I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer--the only friend I
have in the world--and I did not think that even he was kind and
self-sacrificing enough to do it.--I'm grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can't take your money."exclaimed Macloud--"you do me too much credit, Croyden.I'm
ashamed to admit it, but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble.It's a way we have in Northumberland.We may
feel for misfortune, but it rarely gets as far as our pockets.Don't
imagine for a moment that I'm the purchaser.I'm not, though I wish,
now, that I was.""Will you give me your word on that?""I most assuredly will," Macloud answered.He looked at the
letter again.... "And, yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious....
I wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser of the stocks and
bonds, from the Trust Company who held them as collateral?""They won't know," said Macloud."Blaxham & Company bought them at the
public sale.""I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.""They never tell anything, as you are aware," Macloud replied."I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham & Company disclosed their
customer.""Yes, you could--and, likely, lose the sale; they won't disclose.However, that's your business," Macloud observed; "though, it's a pity
to tilt at windmills, for a foolish notion."Croyden creased and uncreased the letter--thinking.Macloud resumed the smoke rings--and waited.It had proved easier than
he had anticipated.Croyden had not once thought of Elaine
Cavendish--and his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....

At length, Croyden put the letter back in its envelope and looked up."I'll sell the bonds," he said--"forward them at once with draft
attached, if you will witness my signature to the transfer.But it's a
queer proceeding, a queer proceeding: paying good money for bad!""That's his business--not yours," said Macloud, easily.Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds from one of the
drawers."You can judge, from the place I keep them, how much I thought them
worth!"When they were duly transferred and witnessed, Croyden attached a draft
drawn on an ordinary sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.He placed them in an
envelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it
over to Macloud."I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts," he remarked, "so,
if you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope
for you."Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked
inquiringly at Croyden."Which, being interpreted," he said, "might mean that you don't intend
to return to Northumberland.""The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I
have not decided.""It's a question of resolution, not of inclination," Croyden answered."I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient
resolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to
live here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.""I've been thinking over the proposition you
recently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl," he said, "and you're all wrong.It's a question of the
respective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.I admit,
the man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support
_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that
she has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the
pair, I repeat.""Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?""I wish I could be so sure," Croyden reflected."Sure of the girl, as
well as sure of myself.""What are you doubtful about--yourself?"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously."I fancy I could manage myself," he said."Try her!--she's worth the try.""Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're
hipped on it!""All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when
you were home?""I did--I dined with her.""You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the
other eighth."Anything left of the
victim, afterward?""I refuse to become facetious," Macloud responded.Then he threw his
cigar into the grate and arose."It matters not what was said, nor who
said it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance
while you have it.""You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----" He walked across to
the window.He would let that sink in.--"How's the Symphony in Blue?""As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.""As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.""I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.""When did you arrange for me to go over?""She confided in you, I suppose?""Not directly; she let me infer it.""In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!""It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter
jewels."I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!""But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll
be present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.""Meet me to-night in dream-land!""Well, they're not
likely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.""Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was
returning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,
well-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do
you make of it?""It seems to me the fellow made it very plain," Macloud returned,
"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the
treasure.""Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,
you didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to
his theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are
within reach.He hoped, by that
means, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make
evidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,
by depositing them in any bank.""Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?""Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You
must remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to
conceal it, pending a Government investigation.""You make him a very canny gentleman.""No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he
is.""And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for
naught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!""It would be a bit annoying," observed Macloud, "to be visited by
burglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune
concealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.""Annoying?--not a bit!""I should rather enjoy the
sport of putting them to flight.""Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated."you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the
Eastern Shore.""The robber-barons were still on the
job in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about
to hold you up for ransom.""I wish I had your fine imagination," scoffed Croyden."I could make a
fortune writing fiction.""Oh, you're not so bad yourself!""It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!""Here, Moses," said Croyden, "take this letter down to the post
office--I want it to catch the first mail.""I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?""And of course you haven't told any one?""I suppose you even told
her the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.""I did!--and showed her the letter besides."No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four
hours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.""We don't have to remain," said Croyden, with affected seriousness--"there
are trains out, you know, as well as in.""I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.""But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!"You don't think I came down here to see only
you, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool
quest on Greenberry Point?"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden."Think she will retail it to the
dear public?""Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,
now!"said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of
the street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,
close fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was
swinging briskly back from town.Macloud watched her a moment in silence."The old man is done for, at last!""Look at the poise of the
head, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's
the way to tell a woman."You better go over," said his friend."It's about the tea hour, she'll
brew you a cup.""And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,
but I'll drink it!""She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!"laughed Croyden; "or make you a
high ball, or you can have it straight--just as you want.""I'll be over, presently," Croyden replied."_I_ don't want any tea,
you know.""Come along, as soon as you
wish--but don't come _too soon_."XV

AN OLD RUSE


Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,
somehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching
smile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much."And, if I may, to you," he replied.After them, you belong to _me_," she laughed."I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of
acquaintance," with a naive look."But not the order of--regard.""You did it very well for a--novice.""You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!""I can't accept, and be honest," he replied.Perchance,
you will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!""Perchance, I will--the high ball!"She looked at him, with a sly smile."You know that I have just returned," she said."I saw you in the
window at Clarendon.""And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.""And found you waiting for me--just as I expected."Peccavi!_" he said humbly."_Te absolvo!_" she replied, solemnly."Now, let us make a fresh
start--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we
return.""I can postpone the high ball for ever," he averred."Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?""Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----"

"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for
the deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year."Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair."Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk
sense.I think I can do it, if I try."As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street."I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy," he observed to
Macloud."I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is
that too soon?"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment."The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.""It's the favorite walk, here," she explained--"the most picturesque
and the smoothest.""To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,"
Macloud remarked."You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,
a place to spend a while, a place to visit.""Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?""I shouldn't think so," she replied."However, I can see how it would
induce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when
they're miserable.""Such people ought to live in a morgue," agreed Macloud."However
we're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.""There are some rather queer old headstones, out there," she said."Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be
the leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from
whom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to
understand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one
Robert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor
man, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making
supplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,
nor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?""Do you know who Parmenter was?""No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried
with them.""You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke
Duval.""His letter to Marmaduke Duval!""I didn't read any----"

"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry
Point," he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her."I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the
cutting on the tombstone----?""Is a victim begging mercy from him," said Macloud."I like that
Marmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,
bringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside
the place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is
friendship!""It was a sad day in Hampton
when the Colonel died.""He left a good deputy," Macloud replied."Croyden is well-born and
well-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these
days), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.""We are a bit clannish,
still.""Delighted to hear you confess it!"Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,
to Virginia."I knew there was some reason for my liking you!""Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?""Not if there be a means to increase it.""Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants
more!""Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male
sex?""In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!"Croyden told you of his experience, last
evening?""What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at
Clarendon.""But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate
means, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.""In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.""How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?""They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.""They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat," he added."They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you
intend to remain at Clarendon some time?""It depends--on how you treat me.""I engage to be nice for--two weeks!""Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.""And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to
extend the period."She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring."Do you wish me to--consider that?""If you will," he said, bending down."This pace is getting rather
brisk--did you notice it, Mr."You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.""Now don't misunderstand me----"

"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.""A Southern girl usually loves--horses," with a tantalizing smile."It is well for you this is a public street," he said."But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,"
he added."I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.""No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted."The fact that we are on a public street would
not restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you
knew it.""This is rather faster than the former going!""Any way, here is
the Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just
within the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you
Parmenter's grave?"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it
entirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and
blurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter."He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738," said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.""See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly," said Miss
Carrington, indicating with the point of her shoe."I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave," observed
Macloud, "but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much
blood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote
the letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of
that treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,
committed violence, were threatened with violence, did things
surreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and
violence----"

"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways," she quoted."It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered
in crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would
willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.""And is there no hope of finding it?""Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or
in the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.""My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,
doubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged
every inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more
than sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great
storm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash
it on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be
found.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by
Parmenter's grave!"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward
town.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching."I've been communing with Parmenter," said Macloud."I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?""He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.""That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and
seventy years."He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here."one more circumstance to prove the
letter speaks the truth.We find his
will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a
notice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his
body--or the place of its interment!what is really
worth while, we can't find.""Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings
temporarily," said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way
to the door."My dear Davila, so glad to see you!"Croyden,
we thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you
feel at home."I'm delighted to be back," said Croyden."The Carringtons seemed
genuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite
content to return," and he shook her hand, as though he meant it."Of course you may believe it," with an inane giggle."I'm going to
bring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some
day, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home," Croyden replied,
soberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and
presented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was
presented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she
had bubbled a bit more, departed."What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and" (observing smiles on
Croyden and Miss Carrington's faces) "what is she?""I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!""She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!""A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father," Miss
Carrington observed."But I hide it pretty well--while she's here," he protested."If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time."When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As
they approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to
have plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and
the gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library
or living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves
on edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder
at, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and
Josephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,
when Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had
forgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway."Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?""Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!""I didn't know it," said Croyden."Why yo sont 'im, seh.""Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly
arfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,
hows'ever.""Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what
repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I
s'pose.""Do you mean they were
in this house for two hours?"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows
Mistah Snyder well; he's bin heah off'n to wuk befo' yo cum, seh.But I
seed dem gwine th'oo de drawers, an' poundin on the floohs, seh.Dey
went down to de cellar, too, seh, an wuz dyar quite a while."seh, don't you t'inks I knows 'im?I knows 'im from de time
he wuz so high.""Go down and tell Snyder I want to see him, either
to-night or in the morning."The <DW64> bowed, and departed.Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the drawers were in
confusion.He glanced at the book-cases: the books were disarranged.He
turned and looked, questioningly, at Macloud--and a smile slowly
overspread his face."Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!""I wondered how long you would be coming to it!""It's the old ruse, in a slightly modified form.Instead of a
telephone or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the servant knew; a
little more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory
in results.""They are clever rogues," said Croyden--"and the disguise must have
been pretty accurate to deceive Moses.""Disguise is their business," Macloud replied, laconically."If they're
not proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.""And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.""We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,
so we'll see what they took."Every drawer was turned upside down, every
closet awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore
evidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been
missed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the
garret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up
and replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because
there was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking
for jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value."Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,"
said Croyden."I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them
I haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them."Abduction, maybe," Macloud suggested."Some night a black cloth will
be thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an
automobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading
memory.""Moral--don't venture out after sunset!""And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good
pair of legs," added Macloud."I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.""Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.""You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!"said Macloud, "it would be well to take some
precaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,
here--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible."Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.XVI

THE MARABOU MUFF


The next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest
themselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's
society, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid
equanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the
weather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the
blues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each
other.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company
bonds, and was once more on "comfortable street," as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,
he settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss
Carrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was
confident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that
was, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more
than firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that
he wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if
she decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and
quickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left
his address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was
dated Northumberland, and read:

  "My dear Colin--

  "It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to
  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to
  Northumberland?If he is not
  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come
  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his
  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted
  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am
  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness."Sincerely,

                                           "Elaine Cavendish."At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:

"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,
won't you go along?""I'm not going back to Northumberland," he said."I'll promise to come back
with you in two days at the most.""You can easily find your
way back.For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to
go away from it, _again_."And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:

"Well, I may not have to go."A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he
broached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working
around to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his
opportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without
hesitation."Croyden had two reasons for leaving
Northumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.""A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever
spend, indeed.""What was the
trouble--wouldn't she have him?""Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a
mere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.""If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?""He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not
for a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.To
marry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory
to that mutual respect which should exist between them.""We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!""What is it you want me to do?"she asked hastily--"or can I do
anything?""You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a
few days.""Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?""That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?""After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.""She will think it a trifle peculiar.""On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You
see, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she
wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left
Northumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but
me.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come
down and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your
invitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.""Come, we'll work out the letter
together.""Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?""Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy," she answered.--"Moreover, it
would be premature."The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her
breakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's
circulars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,
wherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a
particularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very
succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory."Ashburton,

                             "Hampton, Md."My dear Elaine:--

  "Mr.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the
  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise
  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this
  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey
  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is
  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be
  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply
  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We
  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit
  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your
  arrival--and come before the good weather departs."With lots of love,

                                          "Davila Carrington."Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled."Colin is rather a diplomat--he
managed it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably
worded.I'd forgotten about
Davila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow
found it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,
in answer:

  "Miss Davila Carrington,

       "Hampton, Md."I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud."Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands," she said."I'll cooperate, but you are the general.""Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then," Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station."You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years," said she,
laughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage."And you're the same I had forgotten," Davila replied."And it's just as delightful to be able to remember," was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss
Carrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently
Macloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her
charge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had
seen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she
hid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their
hats--and drove straight on."Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?""I noticed a bag in the trap,
however, so I reckon she's a guest.""Your opportunity, for the
solitariness of two, will be limited."It depends on what she is--I'm not
sacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.""Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to
plead for an excuse."I'm not worried about the guest," Macloud
remarked."There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which
promised very well," Croyden remarked."I think this would be a good
day to drop in for tea.""And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her
off on me, and preempt Miss Carrington."She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as
you would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was
something about her that seems familiar.""You're an adept in many things," laughed Macloud, "but, I reckon,
you're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've
seen the combination once or twice before on a woman.""Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?""I haven't the slightest objection----"

"Really!""----to your going along with me--I'm expected!"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and
see us, won't you?'""I trust so," said Macloud, placidly.--"But, as you're never coming
back to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.""I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before."Daniel went to the hallway."I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.""Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.""No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's
painted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.""Yes, I suppose we do," said Macloud."Though we get mighty sick of
seeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded
by the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share
of fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.""We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,
recently!""True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because
half a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,
top heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the
entire town is mad.""It's no worse than any other big town--and
the fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.They just
came all in a bunch.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the
fireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.""And isn't likely to very soon," Macloud responded, "with the whole
Municipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the
penitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and
graft!permeating every department of the civic life--and
published by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the
world to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly
suffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,
that so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is
quiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.""It's the same everywhere," said Croyden."No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the
councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the
street-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some
cigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less
irritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one
hundredths of its inhabitants."When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was
disappearing in a cloud of dust."The fellow driving, unless I am mightily
fooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of
Clarendon," he said."That's interesting--any one with him?""He isn't travelling around with
a petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.""It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?""He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.""I've got a very accurate memory for faces," said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be
declared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try
for them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door."Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!""Distinctly
proper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for
you, presently."*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her
face, when they were past the two men."It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!"The
fact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go
on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her."You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,"
Elaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room."And you made it very easy for me to come.""I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me
were I in a similar position.""I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----"

"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden
had told you of my difficulty----"

"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.""Not exactly that," said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very
attentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget
there are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take
him seriously.""I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he
doesn't!""He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to
gauge.""Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a
more indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even
an affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,
Davila!"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,
then.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in
company?""I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to
have a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged."Macloud is to come in a moment before
luncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr."Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?""He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.""If you've got him into the tea habit, you can
do what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.""I never tried him with tea," said Davila."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure.""It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *




Transcriber's note:

Minor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors;
otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the
author's words and intent.The majority of the working men were also very
indignant when they heard about the Secretary's letter: they said the
rates were quite high enough as it was, and they sneered at him for
presuming to write to the papers at all:

'Who the bloody 'ell was 'e?''E
was only a workin' man the same as themselves--a common carpenter!What
the 'ell did 'e know about it?'E was just trying to make
'isself out to be Somebody, that was all.The idea of one of the likes
of them writing to the papers!'One day, having nothing better to do, Owen was looking at some books
that were exposed for sale on a table outside a second-hand furniture
shop.One book in particular took his attention: he read several pages
with great interest, and regretted that he had not the necessary
sixpence to buy it.The title of the book was: Consumption: Its Causes
and Its Cure.The author was a well-known physician who devoted his
whole attention to the study of that disease.Amongst other things,
the book gave rules for the feeding of delicate children, and there
were also several different dietaries recommended for adult persons
suffering from the disease.One of these dietaries amused him very
much, because as far as the majority of those who suffer from
consumption are concerned, the good doctor might just as well have
prescribed a trip to the moon:

'Immediately on waking in the morning, half a pint of milk--this should
be hot, if possible--with a small slice of bread and butter.'At breakfast: half a pint of milk, with coffee, chocolate, or oatmeal:
eggs and bacon, bread and butter, or dry toast.'At eleven o'clock: half a pint of milk with an egg beaten up in it or
some beef tea and bread and butter.'At one o'clock: half a pint of warm milk with a biscuit or sandwich.'At two o'clock: fish and roast mutton, or a mutton chop, with as much
fat as possible: poultry, game, etc., may be taken with vegetables, and
milk pudding.'At five o'clock: hot milk with coffee or chocolate, bread and butter,
watercress, etc.'At eight o'clock: a pint of milk, with oatmeal or chocolate, and
gluten bread, or two lightly boiled eggs with bread and butter.'Before retiring to rest: a glass of warm milk.'During the night: a glass of milk with a biscuit or bread and butter
should be placed by the bedside and be eaten if the patient awakes.'Whilst Owen was reading this book, Crass, Harlow, Philpot and Easton
were talking together on the other side of the street, and presently
Crass caught sight of him.They had been discussing the Secretary's
letter re the halfpenny rate, and as Owen was one of the members of the
Trades Council, Crass suggested that they should go across and tackle
him about it.asked Owen after listening for
about a quarter of an hour to Crass's objection.'That means that you would have to pay sevenpence per year if we had a
halfpenny rate.Wouldn't it be worth sevenpence a year to you to know
that there were no starving children in the town?''Why should I 'ave to 'elp to keep the children of a man who's too lazy
to work, or spends all 'is money on drink?'''Ow are
yer goin' to make out about the likes o' them?''If his children are starving we should feed them first, and punish him
afterwards.''The rates is quite high enough as it is,' grumbled Harlow, who had
four children himself.'That's quite true, but you must remember that the rates the working
classes at present pay are spent mostly for the benefit of other
people.Good roads are maintained for people who ride in motor cars
and carriages; the Park and the Town Band for those who have leisure to
enjoy them; the Police force to protect the property of those who have
something to lose, and so on.But if we pay this rate we shall get
something for our money.''We gets the benefit of the good roads when we 'as to push a 'andcart
with a load o' paint and ladders,' said Easton.'Of course,' said Crass, 'and besides, the workin' class gets the
benefit of all the other things too, because it all makes work.''Well, for my part,' said Philpot, 'I wouldn't mind payin' my share
towards a 'appeny rate, although I ain't got no kids o' me own.'The hostility of most of the working men to the proposed rate was
almost as bitter as that of the 'better' classes--the noble-minded
philanthropists who were always gushing out their sympathy for the
'dear little ones', the loathsome hypocrites who pretended that there
was no need to levy a rate because they were willing to give sufficient
money in the form of charity to meet the case: but the children
continued to go hungry all the same.'Loathsome hypocrites' may seem a hard saying, but it was a matter of
common knowledge that the majority of the children attending the local
elementary schools were insufficiently fed.It was admitted that the
money that could be raised by a halfpenny rate would be more than
sufficient to provide them all with one good meal every day.The
charity-mongers who professed such extravagant sympathy with the 'dear
little children' resisted the levying of the rate 'because it would
press so heavily on the poorer ratepayers', and said that they were
willing to give more in voluntary charity than the rate would amount
to: but, the 'dear little children'--as they were so fond of calling
them--continued to go to school hungry all the same.To judge them by their profession and their performances, it appeared
that these good kind persons were willing to do any mortal thing for
the 'dear little children' except allow them to be fed.If these people had really meant to do what they pretended, they would
not have cared whether they paid the money to a rate-collector or to
the secretary of a charity society and they would have preferred to
accomplish their object in the most efficient and economical way.But although they would not allow the children to be fed, they went to
church and to chapel, glittering with jewellery, their fat carcases
clothed in rich raiment, and sat with smug smiles upon their faces
listening to the fat parsons reading out of a Book that none of them
seemed able to understand, for this was what they read:

'And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of
them, and said: Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My
name, receiveth Me.But whoso shall offend one of these little ones,
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto
you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father.'And this: 'Then shall He say unto them: Depart from me, ye cursed, into
the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was
an hungered and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave Me no
drink: I was a stranger and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me
not.'Then shall they answer: "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered or athirst
or a stranger or naked, or sick, and did not minister unto Thee?"and
He shall answer them, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not
to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me."'These were the sayings that the infidel parsons mouthed in the infidel
temples to the richly dressed infidel congregations, who heard but did
not understand, for their hearts were become gross and their ears dull
of hearing.And meantime, all around them, in the alley and the slum,
and more terrible still--because more secret--in the better sort of
streets where lived the respectable class of skilled artisans, the
little children became thinner and paler day by day for lack of proper
food, and went to bed early because there was no fire.Sir Graball D'Encloseland, the Member of Parliament for the borough,
was one of the bitterest opponents of the halfpenny rate, but as he
thought it was probable that there would soon be another General
Election and he wanted the children's fathers to vote for him again, he
was willing to do something for them in another way.He had a
ten-year-old daughter whose birthday was in that month, so the
kind-hearted Baronet made arrangements to give a Tea to all the school
children in the town in honour of the occasion.The tea was served in
the schoolrooms and each child was presented with a gilt-edged card on
which was a printed portrait of the little hostess, with 'From your
loving little friend, Honoria D'Encloseland', in gold letters.During
the evening the little girl, accompanied by Sir Graball and Lady
D'Encloseland, motored round to all the schools where the tea was being
consumed: the Baronet made a few remarks, and Honoria made a pretty
little speech, specially learnt for the occasion, at each place, and
they were loudly cheered and greatly admired in response.The
enthusiasm was not confined to the boys and girls, for while the
speechmaking was going on inside, a little crowd of grown-up children
were gathered round outside the entrance, worshipping the motor car:
and when the little party came out the crowd worshipped them also,
going into imbecile ecstasies of admiration of their benevolence and
their beautiful clothes.For several weeks everybody in the town was in raptures over this
tea--or, rather, everybody except a miserable little minority of
Socialists, who said it was bribery, an electioneering dodge, that did
no real good, and who continued to clamour for a halfpenny rate.Another specious fraud was the 'Distress Committee'.This body--or
corpse, for there was not much vitality in it--was supposed to exist
for the purpose of providing employment for 'deserving cases'.One
might be excused for thinking that any man--no matter what his past may
have been--who is willing to work for his living is a 'deserving case':
but this was evidently not the opinion of the persons who devised the
regulations for the working of this committee.Every applicant for
work was immediately given a long job, and presented with a double
sheet of foolscap paper to do it with.Now, if the object of the
committee had been to furnish the applicant with material for the
manufacture of an appropriate headdress for himself, no one could
reasonably have found fault with them: but the foolscap was not to be
utilized in that way; it was called a 'Record Paper', three pages of it
were covered with insulting, inquisitive, irrelevant questions
concerning the private affairs and past life of the 'case' who wished
to be permitted to work for his living, and all these had to be
answered to the satisfaction of Messrs D'Encloseland, Bosher, Sweater,
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and the other members of the committee, before
the case stood any chance of getting employment.However, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the questions on the
application form, during the five months that this precious committee
was in session, no fewer than 1,237 broken-spirited and humble 'lion's
whelps' filled up the forms and answered the questions as meekly as if
they had been sheep.The funds of the committee consisted of L500,
obtained from the Imperial Exchequer, and about L250 in charitable
donations.This money was used to pay wages for certain work--some of
which would have had to be done even if the committee had never
existed--and if each of the 1,237 applicants had had an equal share of
the work, the wages they would have received would have amounted to
about twelve shillings each.This was what the 'practical' persons,
the 'business-men', called 'dealing with the problem of unemployment'.Imagine having to keep your family for five months with twelve
shillings!And, if you like, imagine that the Government grant had been four times
as much as it was, and that the charity had amounted to four times as
much as it did, and then fancy having to keep your family for five
months with two pounds eight shillings!It is true that some of the members of the committee would have been
very glad if they had been able to put the means of earning a living
within the reach of every man who was willing to work; but they simply
did not know what to do, or how to do it.They were not ignorant of
the reality of the evil they were supposed to be 'dealing
with'--appalling evidences of it faced them on every side, and as,
after all, these committee men were human beings and not devils, they
would have been glad to mitigate it if they could have done so without
hurting themselves: but the truth was that they did not know what to do!These are the 'practical' men; the monopolists of intelligence, the
wise individuals who control the affairs of the world: it is in
accordance with the ideas of such men as these that the conditions of
human life are regulated.This is the position:

It is admitted that never before in the history of mankind was it
possible to produce the necessaries of life in such abundance as at
present.The management of the affairs of the world--the business of arranging
the conditions under which we live--is at present in the hands of
Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men.The result of their management is, that the majority of the people find
it a hard struggle to live.Large numbers exist in perpetual poverty:
a great many more periodically starve: many actually die of want:
hundreds destroy themselves rather than continue to live and suffer.When the Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men are asked why
they do not remedy this state of things, they reply that they do not
know what to do!or, that it is impossible to remedy it!And yet it is admitted that it is now possible to produce the
necessaries of life, in greater abundance than ever before!With lavish kindness, the Supreme Being had provided all things
necessary for the existence and happiness of his creatures.To suggest
that it is not so is a blasphemous lie: it is to suggest that the
Supreme Being is not good or even just.On every side there is an
overflowing superfluity of the materials requisite for the production
of all the necessaries of life: from these materials everything we need
may be produced in abundance--by Work.Here was an army of people
lacking the things that may be made by work, standing idle.Willing to
work; clamouring to be allowed to work, and the Practical,
Level-headed, Sensible Business-men did not know what to do!Of course, the real reason for the difficulty is that the raw materials
that were created for the use and benefit of all have been stolen by a
small number, who refuse to allow them to be used for the purposes for
which they were intended.This numerically insignificant minority
refused to allow the majority to work and produce the things they need;
and what work they do graciously permit to be done is not done with the
object of producing the necessaries of life for those who work, but for
the purpose of creating profit for their masters.And then, strangest fact of all, the people who find it a hard struggle
to live, or who exist in dreadful poverty and sometimes starve, instead
of trying to understand the causes of their misery and to find out a
remedy themselves, spend all their time applauding the Practical,
Sensible, Level-headed Business-men, who bungle and mismanage their
affairs, and pay them huge salaries for doing so.Sir Graball
D'Encloseland, for instance, was a 'Secretary of State' and was paid
L5,000 a year.When he first got the job the wages were only a
beggarly L2,000, but as he found it impossible to exist on less than
L100 a week he decided to raise his salary to that amount; and the
foolish people who find it a hard struggle to live paid it willingly,
and when they saw the beautiful motor car and the lovely clothes and
jewellery he purchased for his wife with the money, and heard the Great
Speech he made--telling them how the shortage of everything was caused
by Over-production and Foreign Competition, they clapped their hands
and went frantic with admiration.Their only regret was that there
were no horses attached to the motor car, because if there had been,
they could have taken them out and harnessed themselves to it instead.Nothing delighted the childish minds of these poor people so much as
listening to or reading extracts from the speeches of such men as
these; so in order to amuse them, every now and then, in the midst of
all the wretchedness, some of the great statesmen made 'great speeches'
full of cunning phrases intended to hoodwink the fools who had elected
them.The very same week that Sir Graball's salary was increased to
L5,000 a year, all the papers were full of a very fine one that he
made.They appeared with large headlines like this:

             GREAT SPEECH BY SIR GRABALL D'ENCLOSELAND

                          Brilliant Epigram!None should have more than they need, whilst any have less than
    they need!The hypocrisy of such a saying in the mouth of a man who was drawing a
salary of five thousand pounds a year did not appear to occur to
anyone.On the contrary, the hired scribes of the capitalist Press
wrote columns of fulsome admiration of the miserable claptrap, and the
working men who had elected this man went into raptures over the
'Brilliant Epigram' as if it were good to eat.They cut it out of the
papers and carried it about with them: they showed it to each other:
they read it and repeated it to each other: they wondered at it and
were delighted with it, grinning and gibbering at each other in the
exuberance of their imbecile enthusiasm.The Distress Committee was not the only body pretending to 'deal' with
the poverty 'problem': its efforts were supplemented by all the other
agencies already mentioned--the Labour Yard, the Rummage Sales, the
Organized Benevolence Society, and so on, to say nothing of a most
benevolent scheme originated by the management of Sweater's Emporium,
who announced in a letter that was published in the local Press that
they were prepared to employ fifty men for one week to carry sandwich
boards at one shilling--and a loaf of bread--per day.They got the men; some unskilled labourers, a few old, worn out
artisans whom misery had deprived of the last vestiges of pride or
shame; a number of habitual drunkards and loafers, and a non-descript
lot of poor ragged old men--old soldiers and others of whom it would be
impossible to say what they had once been.The procession of sandwich men was headed by the Semi-drunk and the
Besotted Wretch, and each board was covered with a printed poster:
'Great Sale of Ladies' Blouses now Proceeding at Adam Sweater's
Emporium.'Besides this artful scheme of Sweater's for getting a good
advertisement on the cheap, numerous other plans for providing
employment or alleviating the prevailing misery were put forward in the
columns of the local papers and at the various meetings that were held.Any foolish, idiotic, useless suggestion was certain to receive
respectful attention; any crafty plan devised in his own interest or
for his own profit by one or other of the crew of sweaters and
landlords who controlled the town was sure to be approved of by the
other inhabitants of Mugsborough, the majority of whom were persons of
feeble intellect who not only allowed themselves to be robbed and
exploited by a few cunning scoundrels, but venerated and applauded them
for doing it.Chapter 38

The Brigands' Cave


One evening in the drawing-room at 'The Cave' there was a meeting of a
number of the 'Shining Lights' to arrange the details of a Rummage
Sale, that was to be held in aid of the unemployed.It was an informal
affair, and while they were waiting for the other luminaries, the early
arrivals, Messrs Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mr Oyley Sweater, the
Borough Surveyor, Mr Wireman, the electrical engineer who had been
engaged as an 'expert' to examine and report on the Electric Light
Works, and two or three other gentlemen--all members of the Band--took
advantage of the opportunity to discuss a number of things they were
mutually interested in, which were to be dealt with at the meeting of
the Town Council the next day.First, there was the affair of the
untenanted Kiosk on the Grand Parade.This building belonged to the
Corporation, and 'The Cosy Corner Refreshment Coy.'of which Mr Grinder
was the managing director, was thinking of hiring it to open as a
high-class refreshment lounge, provided the Corporation would make
certain alterations and let the place at a reasonable rent.Another
item which was to be discussed at the Council meeting was Mr Sweater's
generous offer to the Corporation respecting the new drain connecting
'The Cave' with the Town Main.The report of Mr Wireman, the electrical expert, was also to be dealt
with, and afterwards a resolution in favour of the purchase of the
Mugsborough Electric light and Installation Co.Ltd by the town, was to
be proposed.In addition to these matters, several other items, including a proposal
by Mr Didlum for an important reform in the matter of conducting the
meetings of the Council, formed subjects for animated conversation
between the brigands and their host.During this discussion other luminaries arrived, including several
ladies and the Rev.Mr Bosher, of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre.The drawing-room of 'The Cave' was now elaborately furnished.A large
mirror in a richly gilt frame reached from the carved marble
mantelpiece to the cornice.A magnificent clock in an alabaster case
stood in the centre of the mantelpiece and was flanked by two
exquisitely painted and gilded vases of Dresden ware.The windows were
draped with costly hangings, the floor was covered with a luxurious
carpet and expensive rugs.Sumptuously upholstered couches and easy
chairs added to the comfort of the apartment, which was warmed by the
immense fire of coal and oak logs that blazed and crackled in the grate.The conversation now became general and at times highly philosophical
in character, although Mr Bosher did not take much part, being too
busily engaged gobbling up the biscuits and tea, and only occasionally
spluttering out a reply when a remark or question was directly
addressed to him.This was Mr Grinder's first visit at the house, and he expressed his
admiration of the manner in which the ceiling and the walls were
decorated, remarking that he had always liked this 'ere Japanese style.Mr Bosher, with his mouth full of biscuit, mumbled that it was sweetly
pretty--charming--beautifully done--must have cost a lot of money.'Hardly wot you'd call Japanese, though, is it?'observed Didlum,
looking round with the air of a connoisseur.'I should be inclined to
say it was rather more of the--er--Chinese or Egyptian.''Moorish,' explained Mr Sweater with a smile.'I got the idear at the
Paris Exhibition.It's simler to the decorations in the "Halambara",
the palace of the Sultan of Morocco.That clock there is in the same
style.'The case of the clock referred to--which stood on a table in a corner
of the room--was of fretwork, in the form of an Indian Mosque, with a
pointed dome and pinnacles.This was the case that Mary Linden had
sold to Didlum; the latter had had it stained a dark colour and
polished and further improved it by substituting a clock of more
suitable design than the one it originally held.Mr Sweater had
noticed it in Didlum's window and, seeing that the design was similar
in character to the painted decorations on the ceiling and walls of his
drawing-room, had purchased it.'I went to the Paris Exhibition meself,' said Grinder, when everyone
had admired the exquisite workmanship of the clock-case.'I remember
'avin' a look at the moon through that big telescope.I was never so
surprised in me life: you can see it quite plain, and it's round!'You didn't used to think it was square, did yer?''No, of course not, but I always used to think it was flat--like a
plate, but it's round like a football.''Certainly: the moon is a very simler body to the earth,' explained
Didlum, describing an aerial circle with a wave of his hand.They
moves through the air together, but the earth is always nearest to the
sun and consequently once a fortnight the shadder of the earth falls on
the moon and darkens it so that it's invisible to the naked eye.The
new moon is caused by the moon movin' a little bit out of the earth's
shadder, and it keeps on comin' more and more until we gets the full
moon; and then it goes back again into the shadder; and so it keeps on.'For about a minute everyone looked very solemn, and the profound
silence was disturbed only the the crunching of the biscuits between
the jaws of Mr Bosher, and by certain gurglings in the interior of that
gentleman.'Science is a wonderful thing,' said Mr Sweater at length, wagging his
head gravely, 'wonderful!''Yes: but a lot of it is mere theory, you know,' observed Rushton.'Take this idear that the world is round, for instance; I fail to see
it!And then they say as Hawstralia is on the other side of the globe,
underneath our feet.In my opinion it's ridiculous, because if it was
true, wot's to prevent the people droppin' orf?''Yes: well, of course it's very strange,' admitted Sweater.'I've
often thought of that myself.If it was true, we ought to be able to
walk on the ceiling of this room, for instance; but of course we know
that's impossible, and I really don't see that the other is any more
reasonable.''I've often noticed flies walkin' on the ceilin',' remarked Didlum, who
felt called upon to defend the globular theory.'Yes; but they're different,' replied Rushton.'Flies is provided by
nature with a gluey substance which oozes out of their feet for the
purpose of enabling them to walk upside down.''There's one thing that seems to me to finish that idear once for all,'
said Grinder, 'and that is--water always finds its own level.You can't
get away from that; and if the world was round, as they want us to
believe, all the water would run off except just a little at the top.To my mind, that settles the whole argymint.''Another thing that gets over me,' continued Rushton, 'is this:
according to science, the earth turns round on its axle at the rate of
twenty miles a minit.Well, what about when a lark goes up in the sky
and stays there about a quarter of an hour?Why, if it was true that
the earth was turnin' round at that rate all the time, when the bird
came down it would find itself 'undreds of miles away from the place
where it went up from!But that doesn't 'appen at all; the bird always
comes down in the same spot.''Yes, and the same thing applies to balloons and flyin' machines,' said
Grinder.'If it was true that the world is spinnin' round on its axle
so quick as that, if a man started out from Calais to fly to Dover, by
the time he got to England he'd find 'imself in North America, or
p'r'aps farther off still.''And if it was true that the world goes round the sun at the rate they
makes out, when a balloon went up, the earth would run away from it!They'd never be able to get back again!'This was so obvious that nearly everyone said there was probably
something in it, and Didlum could think of no reply.Mr Bosher upon
being appealed to for his opinion, explained that science was alright
in its way, but unreliable: the things scientists said yesterday they
contradicted today, and what they said today they would probably
repudiate tomorrow.It was necessary to be very cautious before
accepting any of their assertions.'Talking about science,' said Grinder, as the holy man relapsed into
silence and started on another biscuit and a fresh cup of tea.'Talking
about science reminds me of a conversation I 'ad with Dr Weakling the
other day.You know, he believes we're all descended from monkeys.'Everyone laughed; the thing was so absurd: the idea of placing
intellectual beings on a level with animals!'But just wait till you hear how nicely I flattened 'im out,' continued
Grinder.'After we'd been arguin' a long time about wot 'e called
everlution or some sich name, and a lot more tommy-rot that I couldn't
make no 'ead or tail of--and to tell you the truth I don't believe 'e
understood 'arf of it 'imself--I ses to 'im, "Well," I ses, "if it's
true that we're hall descended from monkeys," I ses, "I think your
famly must 'ave left orf where mine begun."'In the midst of the laughter that greeted the conclusion of Grinder's
story it was seen that Mr Bosher had become black in the face.He was
waving his arms and writhing about like one in a fit, his goggle eyes
bursting from their sockets, whilst his huge stomach quivering
spasmodically, alternately contracted and expanded as if it were about
to explode.In the exuberance of his mirth, the unfortunate disciple had swallowed
two biscuits at once.Everybody rushed to his assistance, Grinder and
Didlum seized an arm and a shoulder each and forced his head down.Rushton punched him in the back and the ladies shrieked with alarm.They gave him a big drink of tea to help to get the biscuits down, and
when he at last succeeded in swallowing them he sat in the armchair
with his eyes red-rimmed and full of tears, which ran down over his
white, flabby face.The arrival of the other members of the committee put an end to the
interesting discussion, and they shortly afterwards proceeded with the
business for which the meeting had been called--the arrangements for
the forthcoming Rummage Sale.Chapter 39

The Brigands at Work


The next day, at the meeting of the Town Council, Mr Wireman's report
concerning the Electric Light Works was read.The expert's opinion was
so favourable--and it was endorsed by the Borough Engineer, Mr Oyley
Sweater--that a resolution was unanimously carried in favour of
acquiring the Works for the town, and a secret committee was appointed
to arrange the preliminaries.Alderman Sweater then suggested that a
suitable honorarium be voted to Mr Wireman for his services.This was
greeted with a murmur of approval from most of the members, and Mr
Didlum rose with the intention of proposing a resolution to that effect
when he was interrupted by Alderman Grinder, who said he couldn't see
no sense in giving the man a thing like that.'Why not give him a sum
of money?'Several members said 'Hear, hear,' to this, but some of the others
laughed.'I can't see nothing to laugh at,' cried Grinder angrily.'For my part
I wouldn't give you tuppence for all the honorariums in the country.I
move that we pay 'im a sum of money.''I'll second that,' said another member of the Band--one of those who
had cried 'Hear, Hear.'Alderman Sweater said that there seemed to be a little misunderstanding
and explained that an honorarium WAS a sum of money.'Oh, well, in that case I'll withdraw my resolution,' said Grinder.'I
thought you wanted to give 'im a 'luminated address or something like
that.'Didlum now moved that a letter of thanks and a fee of fifty guineas be
voted to Mr Wireman, and this was also unanimously agreed to.Dr
Weakling said that it seemed rather a lot, but he did not go so far as
to vote against it.The next business was the proposal that the Corporation should take
over the drain connecting Mr Sweater's house with the town main.Mr
Sweater--being a public-spirited man--proposed to hand this connecting
drain--which ran through a private road--over to the Corporation to be
theirs and their successors for ever, on condition that they would pay
him the cost of construction--L55--and agreed to keep it in proper
repair.After a brief discussion it was decided to take over the drain
on the terms offered, and then Councillor Didlum proposed a vote of
thanks to Alderman Sweater for his generosity in the matter: this was
promptly seconded by Councillor Rushton and would have been carried
nem.con., but for the disgraceful conduct of Dr Weakling, who had the
bad taste to suggest that the amount was about double what the drain
could possibly have cost to construct, that it was of no use to the
Corporation at all, and that they would merely acquire the liability to
keep it in repair.However, no one took the trouble to reply to Weakling, and the Band
proceeded to the consideration of the next business, which was Mr
Grinder's offer--on behalf of the 'Cosy Corner Refreshment Company'--to
take the Kiosk on the Grand Parade.Mr Grinder submitted a plan of
certain alterations that he would require the Corporation to make at
the Kiosk, and, provided the Council agreed to do this work he was
willing to take a lease of the place for five years at L20 per year.Councillor Didlum proposed that the offer of the 'Cosy Corner
Refreshment Co.Ltd' be accepted and the required alterations proceeded
with at once.The Kiosk had brought in no rent for nearly two years,
but, apart from that consideration, if they accepted this offer they
would be able to set some of the unemployed to work.Dr Weakling pointed out that as the proposed alterations would cost
about L175--according to the estimate of the Borough Engineer--and, the
rent being only L20 a year, it would mean that the Council would be L75
out of pocket at the end of the five years; to say nothing of the
expense of keeping the place in repair during all that time.He moved as an amendment that the alterations be made,
and that they then invite tenders, and let the place to the highest
bidder.Councillor Rushton said he was disgusted with the attitude taken up by
that man Weakling.Perhaps it was hardly right to call
him a man.In the matter of these alterations they had
had the use of Councillor Grinder's brains: it was he who first thought
of making these improvements in the Kiosk, and therefore he--or rather
the company he represented--had a moral right to the tenancy.Dr Weakling said that he thought it was understood that when a man was
elected to that Council it was because he was supposed to be willing to
use his brains for the benefit of his constituents.The Mayor asked if there was any seconder to Weakling's amendment, and
as there was not the original proposition was put and carried.Councillor Rushton suggested that a large shelter with seating
accommodation for about two hundred persons should be erected on the
Grand Parade near the Kiosk.The shelter would serve as a protection
against rain, or the rays of the sun in summer.It would add
materially to the comfort of visitors and would be a notable addition
to the attractions of the town.Councillor Didlum said it was a very good idear, and proposed that the
Surveyor be instructed to get out the plans.It seemed to him that the
object was to benefit, not the town, but Mr Grinder.If
this shelter were erected, it would increase the value of the Kiosk as
a refreshment bar by a hundred per cent.If Mr Grinder wanted a
shelter for his customers he should pay for it himself.He
(Dr Weakling) was sorry to have to say it, but he could not help
thinking that this was a Put-up job.(Loud cries of 'Withdraw'
'Apologize' 'Cast 'im out' and terrific uproar.)Weakling did not apologize or withdraw, but he said no more.Didlum's
proposition was carried, and the 'Band' went on to the next item on the
agenda, which was a proposal by Councillor Didlum to increase the
salary of Mr Oyley Sweater, the Borough Engineer, from fifteen pounds
to seventeen pounds per week.Councillor Didlum said that when they had a good man they ought to
appreciate him.Compared with other officials, the
Borough Engineer was not fairly paid.The magistrates'
clerk received seventeen pounds a week.The Town Clerk seventeen
pounds per week.He did not wish it to be understood that he thought
those gentlemen were overpaid--far from it.It was not
that they got too much but that the Engineer got too little.How could
they expect a man like that to exist on a paltry fifteen pounds a week?Why, it was nothing more or less than sweating!He had
much pleasure in moving that the Borough Engineer's salary be increased
to seventeen pounds a week, and that his annual holiday be extended
from a fortnight to one calendar month with hard la--he begged
pardon--with full pay.Councillor Rushton said that he did not propose to make a long
speech--it was not necessary.He would content himself with formally
seconding Councillor Didlum's excellent proposition.Councillor Weakling, whose rising was greeted with derisive laughter,
said he must oppose the resolution.He wished it to be understood that
he was not actuated by any feeling of personal animosity towards the
Borough Engineer, but at the same time he considered it his duty to say
that in his (Dr Weakling's) opinion, that official would be dear at
half the price they were now paying him.He did not
appear to understand his business, nearly all the work that was done
cost in the end about double what the Borough Engineer estimated it
could be done for.He considered him to be a grossly
incompetent person (uproar) and was of opinion that if they were to
advertise they could get dozens of better men who would be glad to do
the work for five pounds a week.He moved that Mr Oyley Sweater be
asked to resign and that they advertise for a man at five pounds a
week.Councillor Grinder rose to a point of order.He appealed to the
Chairman to squash the amendment.Councillor Didlum remarked that he supposed Councillor Grinder meant
'quash': in that case, he would support the suggestion.Councillor Grinder said it was about time they put a stopper on that
feller Weakling.He (Grinder) did not care whether they called it
squashing or quashing; it was all the same so long as they nipped him
in the bud.The man was a disgrace to the Council; always
interfering and hindering the business.The Mayor--Alderman Sweater--said that he did not think it consistent
with the dignity of that Council to waste any more time over this
scurrilous amendment.He was proud to say that it had
never even been seconded, and therefore he would put Mr Didlum's
resolution--a proposition which he had no hesitation in saying
reflected the highest credit upon that gentleman and upon all those who
supported it.All those who were in favour signified their approval in the customary
manner, and as Weakling was the only one opposed, the resolution was
carried and the meeting proceeded to the next business.Councillor Rushton said that several influential ratepayers and
employers of labour had complained to him about the high wages of the
Corporation workmen, some of whom were paid sevenpence-halfpenny an
hour.Sevenpence an hour was the maximum wage paid to skilled workmen
by private employers in that town, and he failed to see why the
Corporation should pay more.It had a very bad effect
on the minds of the men in the employment of private firms, tending to
make them dissatisfied with their wages.The same state of affairs
prevailed with regard to the unskilled labourers in the Council's
employment.Private employers could get that class of labour for
fourpence-halfpenny or fivepence an hour, and yet the corporation paid
fivepence-halfpenny and even sixpence for the same class of work.Considering
that the men in the employment of the Corporation had almost constant
work, if there was to be a difference at all, they should get not more,
but less, than those who worked for private firms.He moved
that the wages of the Corporation workmen be reduced in all cases to
the same level as those paid by private firms.He said it amounted to a positive
scandal.Why, in the summer-time some of these men drew as much as
35/- in a single week!and it was quite common for unskilled
labourers--fellers who did nothing but the very hardest and most
laborious work, sich as carrying sacks of cement, or digging up the
roads to get at the drains, and sich-like easy jobs--to walk off with
25/- a week!He had often noticed some of these men
swaggering about the town on Sundays, dressed like millionaires and
cigared up!They seemed quite a different class of men from those who
worked for private firms, and to look at the way some of their children
was dressed you'd think their fathers was Cabinet Minstrels!No wonder
the ratepayers complained ot the high rates.Another grievance was
that all the Corporation workmen were allowed two days' holiday every
year, in addition to the Bank Holidays, and were paid for them!(Cries
of'shame', 'Scandalous', 'Disgraceful', etc.)No private contractor
paid his men for Bank Holidays, and why should the Corporation do so?He had much pleasure in seconding Councillor Rushton's resolution.He thought that 35/- a week was
little enough for a man to keep a wife and family with (Rot), even if
all the men got it regularly, which they did not.Members should
consider what was the average amount per week throughout the whole
year, not merely the busy time, and if they did that they would find
that even the skilled men did not average more than 25/- a week, and in
many cases not so much.If this subject had not been introduced by
Councillor Rushton, he (Dr Weakling) had intended to propose that the
wages of the Corporation workmen should be increased to the standard
recognized by the Trades Unions.It had been proved
that the notoriously short lives of the working people--whose average
span of life was about twenty years less than that of the well-to-do
classes--their increasingly inferior physique, and the high rate of
mortality amongst their children was caused by the wretched
remuneration they received for hard and tiring work, the excessive
number of hours they have to work, when employed, the bad quality of
their food, the badly constructed and insanitary homes their poverty
compels them to occupy, and the anxiety, worry, and depression of mind
they have to suffer when out of employment.(Cries of 'Rot', 'Bosh',
and loud laughter.)Councillor Didlum said, 'Rot'.It was a very good
word to describe the disease that was sapping the foundations of
society and destroying the health and happiness and the very lives of
so many of their fellow countrymen and women.(Renewed merriment and
shouts of 'Go and buy a red tie.')He appealed to the members to
reject the resolution.He was very glad to say that he believed it was
true that the workmen in the employ of the Corporation were a little
better off than those in the employ of private contractors, and if it
were so, it was as it should be.They had need to be better off than
the poverty-stricken, half-starved poor wretches who worked for private
firms.Councillor Didlum said that it was very evident that Dr Weakling had
obtained his seat on that Council by false pretences.If he had told
the ratepayers that he was a Socialist, they would never have elected
him.Practically every Christian minister in the
country would agree with him (Didlum) when he said that the poverty of
the working classes was caused not by the 'wretched remuneration they
receive as wages', but by Drink.And he was very
sure that the testimony of the clergy of all denominations was more to
be relied upon than the opinion of a man like Dr Weakling.Dr Weakling said that if some of the clergymen referred to or some of
the members of the council had to exist and toil amid the same sordid
surroundings, overcrowding and ignorance as some of the working
classes, they would probably seek to secure some share of pleasure and
forgetfulness in drink themselves!(Great uproar and shouts of
'Order', 'Withdraw', 'Apologize'.)Councillor Grinder said that even if it was true that the haverage
lives of the working classes was twenty years shorter than those of the
better classes, he could not see what it had got to do with Dr
Weakling.So long as the working class was contented to
die twenty years before their time, he failed to see what it had got to
do with other people.They was not runnin' short of workers, was they?So long as the
workin' class was satisfied to die orf--let 'em die orf!The workin' class adn't arst Dr Weakling to
stick up for them, had they?If they wasn't satisfied, they would
stick up for theirselves!The working men didn't want the likes of Dr
Weakling to stick up for them, and they would let 'im know it when the
next election came round.If he (Grinder) was a wordly man, he would
not mind betting that the workin' men of Dr Weakling's ward would give
him 'the dirty kick out' next November.Councillor Weakling, who knew that this was probably true, made no
further protest.Rushton's proposition was carried, and then the Clerk
announced that the next item was the resolution Mr Didlum had given
notice of at the last meeting, and the Mayor accordingly called upon
that gentleman.Councillor Didlum, who was received with loud cheers, said that
unfortunately a certain member of that Council seemed to think he had a
right to oppose nearly everything that was brought forward.(The majority of the members of the Band glared malignantly at
Weakling.)He hoped that for once the individual he referred to would have the
decency to restrain himself, because the resolution he (Didlum) was
about to have the honour of proposing was one that he believed no
right-minded man--no matter what his politics or religious
opinions--could possibly object to; and he trusted that for the credit
of the Council it would be entered on the records as an unopposed
motion.The resolution was as follows:

'That from this date all the meetings of this Council shall be opened
with prayer and closed with the singing of the Doxology.'Councillor Rushton seconded the resolution, which was also supported by
Mr Grinder, who said that at a time like the present, when there was
sich a lot of infiddles about who said that we all came from monkeys,
the Council would be showing a good example to the working classes by
adopting the resolution.Councillor Weakling said nothing, so the new rule was carried nem.con., and as there was no more business to be done it was put into
operation for the first time there and then.Mr Sweater conducting the
singing with a roll of paper--the plan of the drain of 'The Cave'--and
each member singing a different tune.Weakling withdrew during the singing, and afterwards, before the Band
dispersed, it was agreed that a certain number of them were to meet the
Chief at the Cave, on the following evening to arrange the details of
the proposed raid on the finances of the town in connection with the
sale of the Electric Light Works.The alterations which the Corporation had undertaken to make in the
Kiosk on the Grand Parade provided employment for several carpenters
and plasterers for about three weeks, and afterwards for several
painters.This fact was sufficient to secure the working men's
unqualified approval of the action of the Council in letting the place
to Grinder, and Councillor Weakling's opposition--the reasons of which
they did not take the trouble to inquire into or understand--they as
heartily condemned.All they knew or cared was that he had tried to
prevent the work being done, and that he had referred in insulting
terms to the working men of the town.What right had he to call them
half-starved, poverty-stricken, poor wretches?If it came to being
poverty-stricken, according to all accounts, he wasn't any too well orf
hisself.Some of those blokes who went swaggering about in frock-coats
and pot-'ats was just as 'ard up as anyone else if the truth was known.As for the Corporation workmen, it was quite right that their wages
should be reduced.Why should they get more money than anyone else?'It's us what's got to find the money,' they said.'We're the
ratepayers, and why should we have to pay them more wages than we get
ourselves?And why should they be paid for holidays any more than us?'During the next few weeks the dearth of employment continued, for, of
course, the work at the Kiosk and the few others jobs that were being
done did not make much difference to the general situation.Groups of
workmen stood at the corners or walked aimlessly about the streets.Most of them no longer troubled to go to the different firms to ask for
work, they were usually told that they would be sent for if wanted.During this time Owen did his best to convert the other men to his
views.He had accumulated a little library of Socialist books and
pamphlets which he lent to those he hoped to influence.Some of them
took these books and promised, with the air of men who were conferring
a great favour, that they would read them.As a rule, when they
returned them it was with vague expressions of approval, but they
usually evinced a disinclination to discuss the contents in detail
because, in nine instances out of ten, they had not attempted to read
them.As for those who did make a half-hearted effort to do so, in the
majority of cases their minds were so rusty and stultified by long
years of disuse, that, although the pamphlets were generally written in
such simple language that a child might have understood, the argument
was generally too obscure to be grasped by men whose minds were addled
by the stories told them by their Liberal and Tory masters.Some, when
Owen offered to lend them some books or pamphlets refused to accept
them, and others who did him the great favour of accepting them,
afterwards boasted that they had used them as toilet paper.Owen frequently entered into long arguments with the other men, saying
that it was the duty of the State to provide productive work for all
those who were willing to do it.Some few of them listened like men
who only vaguely understood, but were willing to be convinced.It's right enough what you say,' they would remark.Others ridiculed this doctrine of State employment: It was all very
fine, but where was the money to come from?And then those who had
been disposed to agree with Owen could relapse into their old apathy.There were others who did not listen so quietly, but shouted with many
curses that it was the likes of such fellows as Owen who were
responsible for all the depression in trade.All this talk about
Socialism and State employment was frightening Capital out of the
country.Those who had money were afraid to invest it in industries,
or to have any work done for fear they would be robbed.When Owen
quoted statistics to prove that as far as commerce and the quantity
produced of commodities of all kinds was concerned, the last year had
been a record one, they became more infuriated than ever, and talked
threateningly of what they would like to do to those bloody Socialists
who were upsetting everything.One day Crass, who was one of these upholders of the existing system,
scored off Owen finely.A little group of them were standing talking
in the Wage Slave Market near the Fountain.In the course of the
argument, Owen made the remark that under existing conditions life was
not worth living, and Crass said that if he really thought so, there
was no compulsion about it; if he wasn't satisfied--if he didn't want
to live--he could go and die.Why the hell didn't he go and make a
hole in the water, or cut his bloody throat?On this particular occasion the subject of the argument was--at
first--the recent increase of the Borough Engineer's salary to
seventeen pounds per week.Owen had said it was robbery, but the
majority of the others expressed their approval of the increase.They
asked Owen if he expected a man like that to work for nothing!It was
not as if he were one of the likes of themselves.They said that, as
for it being robbery, Owen would be very glad to have the chance of
getting it himself.Most of them seemed to think the fact that anyone
would be glad to have seventeen pounds a week, proved that it was right
for them to pay that amount to the Borough Engineer!Usually whenever Owen reflected upon the gross injustices, and
inhumanity of the existing social disorder, he became convinced that it
could not possibly last; it was bound to fall to pieces because of its
own rottenness.It was not just, it was not common sense, and
therefore it could not endure.But always after one of these
arguments--or, rather, disputes--with his fellow workmen, he almost
relapsed into hopelessness and despondency, for then he realized how
vast and how strong are the fortifications that surround the present
system; the great barriers and ramparts of invincible ignorance, apathy
and self-contempt, which will have to be broken down before the system
of society of which they are the defences, can be swept away.At other times as he thought of this marvellous system, it presented
itself to him in such an aspect of almost comical absurdity that he was
forced to laugh and to wonder whether it really existed at all, or if
it were only an illusion of his own disordered mind.One of the things that the human race needed in order to exist was
shelter; so with much painful labour they had constructed a large
number of houses.Thousands of these houses were now standing
unoccupied, while millions of the people who had helped to build the
houses were either homeless or herding together in overcrowded hovels.These human beings had such a strange system of arranging their affairs
that if anyone were to go and burn down a lot of the houses he would be
conferring a great boon upon those who had built them, because such an
act would 'Make a lot more work!'Another very comical thing was that thousands of people wore broken
boots and ragged clothes, while millions of pairs of boots and
abundance of clothing, which they had helped to make, were locked up in
warehouses, and the System had the keys.Thousands of people lacked the necessaries of life.The necessaries of
life are all produced by work.The people who lacked begged to be
allowed to work and create those things of which they stood in need.If anyone asked the System why it prevented these people from producing
the things of which they were in want, the System replied:

'Because they have already produced too much.The warehouses are filled and overflowing, and there is nothing more
for them to do.'There was in existence a huge accumulation of everything necessary.A
great number of the people whose labour had produced that vast store
were now living in want, but the System said that they could not be
permitted to partake of the things they had created.Then, after a
time, when these people, being reduced to the last extreme of misery,
cried out that they and their children were dying of hunger, the System
grudgingly unlocked the doors of the great warehouses, and taking out a
small part of the things that were stored within, distributed it
amongst the famished workers, at the same time reminding them that it
was Charity, because all the things in the warehouses, although they
had been made by the workers, were now the property of the people who
do nothing.And then the starving, bootless, ragged, stupid wretches fell down and
worshipped the System, and offered up their children as living
sacrifices upon its altars, saying:

'This beautiful System is the only one possible, and the best that
human wisdom can devise.Cursed be
those who seek to destroy the System!'As the absurdity of the thing forced itself upon him, Owen, in spite of
the unhappiness he felt at the sight of all the misery by which he was
surrounded, laughed aloud and said to himself that if he was sane, then
all these people must be mad.In the face of such colossal imbecility it was absurd to hope for any
immediate improvement.The little already accomplished was the work of
a few self-sacrificing enthusiasts, battling against the opposition of
those they sought to benefit, and the results of their labours were, in
many instances, as pearls cast before the swine who stood watching for
opportunities to fall upon and rend their benefactors.It was possible that the monopolists,
encouraged by the extraordinary stupidity and apathy of the people
would proceed to lay upon them even greater burdens, until at last,
goaded by suffering, and not having sufficient intelligence to
understand any other remedy, these miserable wretches would turn upon
their oppressors and drown both them and their System in a sea of blood.Besides the work at the Kiosk, towards the end of March things
gradually began to improve in other directions.Several firms began to
take on a few hands.Several large empty houses that were relet had to
be renovated for their new tenants, and there was a fair amount of
inside work arising out of the annual spring-cleaning in other houses.There was not enough work to keep everyone employed, and most of those
who were taken on as a rule only managed to make a few hours a week,
but still it was better than absolute idleness, and there also began to
be talk of several large outside jobs that were to be done as soon as
the weather was settled.This bad weather, by the way, was a sort of boon to the defenders of
the present system, who were hard-up for sensible arguments to explain
the cause of poverty.One of the principal causes was, of course, the
weather, which was keeping everything back.There was not the
slightest doubt that if only the weather would allow there would always
be plenty of work, and poverty would be abolished.had a fair share of what work there was, and Crass,
Sawkins, Slyme and Owen were kept employed pretty regularly, although
they did not start until half past eight and left off at four.At
different houses in various parts of the town they had ceilings to wash
off and distemper, to strip the old paper from the walls, and to
repaint and paper the rooms, and sometimes there were the venetian
blinds to repair and repaint.Occasionally a few extra hands were
taken on for a few days, and discharged again as soon as the job they
were taken on to do was finished.The defenders of the existing system may possibly believe that the
knowledge that they would be discharged directly the job was done was a
very good incentive to industry, that they would naturally under these
circumstances do their best to get the work done as quickly as
possible.But then it must be remembered that most of the defenders of
the existing system are so constituted, that they can believe anything
provided it is not true and sufficiently silly.All the same, it was a fact that the workmen did do their very best to
get over this work in the shortest possible time, because although they
knew that to do so was contrary to their own interests, they also knew
that it would be very much more contrary to their interests not to do
so.Their only chance of being kept on if other work came in was to
tear into it for all they were worth.Consequently, most of the work
was rushed and botched and slobbered over in about half the time that
it would have taken to do it properly.Rooms for which the customers
paid to have three coats of paint were scamped with one or two.What
Misery did not know about scamping and faking the work, the men
suggested to and showed him in the hope of currying favour with him in
order that they might get the preference over others and be sent for
when the next job came in.This is the principal incentive provided by
the present system, the incentive to cheat.These fellows cheated the
customers of their money.They cheated themselves and their fellow
workmen of work, and their children of bread, but it was all for a good
cause--to make profit for their master.Harlow and Slyme did one job--a room that Rushton & Co.It was finished with two and the men cleared
away their paints.The next day, when Slyme went there to paper the
room, the lady of the house said that the painting was not yet
finished--it was to have another coat.Slyme assured her that it had
already had three, but, as the lady insisted, Slyme went to the shop
and sought out Misery.Harlow had been stood off, as there was not
another job in just then, but fortunately he happened to be standing in
the street outside the shop, so they called him and then the three of
them went round to the job and swore that the room had had three coats.She had watched the progress of
the work.Besides, it was impossible; they had only been there three
days.The first day they had not put any paint on at all; they had
done the ceiling and stripped the walls; the painting was not started
till the second day.Misery
explained the mystery: he said that for first coating they had an extra
special very fast-drying paint--paint that dried so quickly that they
were able to give the work two coats in one day.For instance, one man
did the window, the other the door: when these were finished both men
did the skirting; by the time the skirting was finished the door and
window were dry enough to second coat; and then, on the following
day--the finishing coat!Of course, this extra special quick-drying paint was very expensive,
but the firm did not mind that.They knew that most of their customers
wished to have their work finished as quickly as possible, and their
study was to give satisfaction to the customers.This explanation
satisfied the lady--a poverty-stricken widow making a precarious living
by taking in lodgers--who was the more easily deceived because she
regarded Misery as a very holy man, having seen him preaching in the
street on many occasions.There was another job at another boarding-house that Owen and Easton
did--two rooms which had to be painted three coats of white paint and
one of enamel, making four coats altogether.That was what the firm
had contracted to do.As the old paint in these rooms was of a rather
dark shade it was absolutely necessary to give the work three coats
before enamelling it.Misery wanted them to let it go with two, but
Owen pointed out that if they did so it would be such a ghastly mess
that it would never pass.After thinking the matter over for a few
minutes, Misery told them to go on with the third coat of paint.Then
he went downstairs and asked to see the lady of the house.He
explained to her that, in consequence of the old paint being so dark,
he found that it would be necessary, in order to make a good job of it,
to give the work four coats before enamelling it.Of course, they had
agreed for only three, but as they always made a point of doing their
work in a first-class manner rather than not make a good job, they
would give it the extra coat for nothing, but he was sure she would not
wish them to do that.The lady said that she did not want them to work
for nothing, and she wanted it done properly.If it were necessary to
give it an extra coat, they must do so and she would pay for it.The lady was satisfied, and Misery
was in the seventh heaven.Then he went upstairs again and warned Owen
and Easton to be sure to say, if they were asked, that the work had had
four coats.It would not be reasonable to blame Misery or Rushton for not wishing
to do good, honest work--there was no incentive.When they secured a
contract, if they had thought first of making the very best possible
job of it, they would not have made so much profit.The incentive was
not to do the work as well as possible, but to do as little as
possible.The incentive was not to make good work, but to make good
profit.They could not justly be blamed
for not doing good work--there was no incentive.To do good work
requires time and pains.Most of them would have liked to take time
and pains, because all those who are capable of doing good work find
pleasure and happiness in doing it, and have pride in it when done: but
there was no incentive, unless the certainty of getting the sack could
be called an incentive, for it was a moral certainty that any man who
was caught taking time and pains with his work would be promptly
presented with the order of the boot.But there was plenty of
incentive to hurry and scamp and slobber and botch.There was another job at a lodging-house--two rooms to be painted and
papered.The landlord paid for the work, but the tenant had the
privilege of choosing the paper.She could have any pattern she liked
so long as the cost did not exceed one shilling per roll, Rushton's
estimate being for paper of that price.Misery sent her several
patterns of sixpenny papers, marked at a shilling, to choose from, but
she did not fancy any of them, and said that she would come to the shop
to make her selection.So Hunter tore round to the shop in a great
hurry to get there before her.In his haste to dismount, he fell off
his bicycle into the muddy road, and nearly smashed the plate-glass
window with the handle-bar of the machine as he placed it against the
shop front before going in.Without waiting to clean the mud off his clothes, he ordered Budd, the
pimply-faced shopman, to get out rolls of all the sixpenny papers they
had, and then they both set to work and altered the price marked upon
them from sixpence to a shilling.Then they got out a number of
shilling papers and altered the price marked upon them, changing it
from a shilling to one and six.When the unfortunate woman arrived, Misery was waiting for her with a
benign smile upon his long visage.He showed her all the sixpenny
ones, but she did not like any of them, so after a while Nimrod
suggested that perhaps she would like a paper of a little better
quality, and she could pay the trifling difference out of her own
pocket.Then he showed her the shilling papers that he had marked up
to one and sixpence, and eventually the lady selected one of these and
paid the extra sixpence per roll herself, as Nimrod suggested.There
were fifteen rolls of paper altogether--seven for one room and eight
for the other--so that in addition to the ordinary profit on the sale
of the paper--about two hundred and seventy-five per cent.--the firm
made seven and sixpence on this transaction.They might have done
better out of the job itself if Slyme had not been hanging the paper
piece-work, for, the two rooms being of the same pattern, he could
easily have managed to do them with fourteen rolls; in fact, that was
all he did use, but he cut up and partly destroyed the one that was
over so that he could charge for hanging it.Owen was working there at the same time, for the painting of the rooms
was not done before Slyme papered them; the finishing coat was put on
after the paper was hung.He noticed Slyme destroying the paper and,
guessing the reason, asked him how he could reconcile such conduct as
that with his profession of religion.Slyme replied that the fact that he was a Christian did not imply that
he never did anything wrong: if he committed a sin, he was a Christian
all the same, and it would be forgiven him for the sake of the Blood.As for this affair of the paper, it was a matter between himself and
God, and Owen had no right to set himself up as a Judge.In addition to all this work, there were a number of funerals.Crass
and Slyme did very well out of it all, working all day white-washing or
painting, and sometimes part of the night painting venetian blinds or
polishing coffins and taking them home, to say nothing of the lifting
in of the corpses and afterwards acting as bearers.As time went on, the number of small jobs increased, and as the days
grew longer the men were allowed to put in a greater number of hours.Most of the firms had some work, but there was never enough to keep all
the men in the town employed at the same time.It worked like this:
Every firm had a certain number of men who were regarded as the regular
hands.When there was any work to do, they got the preference over
strangers or outsiders.When things were busy, outsiders were taken on
temporarily.When the work fell off, these casual hands were the first
to be'stood still'.If it continued to fall off, the old hands were
also stood still in order of seniority, the older hands being preferred
to strangers--so long, of course, as they were not old in the sense of
being aged or inefficient.This kind of thing usually continued all through the spring and summer.In good years the men of all trades, carpenters, bricklayers,
plasterers, painters and so on, were able to keep almost regularly at
work, except in wet weather.The difference between a good and bad spring and summer is that in good
years it is sometimes possible to make a little overtime, and the
periods of unemployment are shorter and less frequent than in bad
years.It is rare even in good years for one of the casual hands to be
employed by one firm for more than one, two or three months without a
break.It is usual for them to put in a month with one firm, then a
fortnight with another, then perhaps six weeks somewhere else, and
often between there are two or three days or even weeks of enforced
idleness.This sort of thing goes on all through spring, summer and
autumn.The Beano Meeting


By the beginning of April, Rushton & Co.were again working nine hours
a day, from seven in the morning till five-thirty at night, and after
Easter they started working full time from 6 A.M.till 5.30 P.M.,
eleven and a half hours--or, rather, ten hours, for they had to lose
half an hour at breakfast and an hour at dinner.Just before Easter several of the men asked Hunter if they might be
allowed to work on Good Friday and Easter Monday, as, they said, they
had had enough holidays during the winter; they had no money to spare
for holiday-making, and they did not wish to lose two days' pay when
there was work to be done.Hunter told them that there was not
sufficient work in to justify him in doing as they requested: things
were getting very slack again, and Mr Rushton had decided to cease work
from Thursday night till Tuesday morning.They were thus prevented
from working on Good Friday, but it is true that not more than one
working man in fifty went to any religious service on that day or on
any other day during the Easter festival.On the contrary, this
festival was the occasion of much cursing and blaspheming on the part
of those whose penniless, poverty-stricken condition it helped to
aggravate by enforcing unprofitable idleness which they lacked the
means to enjoy.During these holidays some of the men did little jobs on their own
account and others put in the whole time--including Good Friday and
Easter Sunday--gardening, digging and planting their plots of allotment
ground.When Owen arrived home one evening during the week before Easter,
Frankie gave him an envelope which he had brought home from school.It
contained a printed leaflet:

                   CHURCH OF THE WHITED SEPULCHRE,
                             MUGSBOROUGH

                             Easter 19--

Dear Sir (or Madam),

In accordance with the usual custom we invite you to join with us in
presenting the Vicar, the Rev.Habbakuk Bosher, with an Easter
Offering, as a token of affection and regard.Yours faithfully,
                          A. Cheeseman }
                          W. Taylor    }  Churchwardens

Mr Bosher's income from various sources connected with the church was
over six hundred pounds a year, or about twelve pounds per week, but as
that sum was evidently insufficient, his admirers had adopted this
device for supplementing it.Frankie said all the boys had one of
these letters and were going to ask their fathers for some money to
give towards the Easter offering.Most of them expected to get
twopence.As the boy had evidently set his heart on doing the same as the other
children, Owen gave him the twopence, and they afterwards learned that
the Easter Offering for that year was one hundred and twenty-seven
pounds, which was made up of the amounts collected from the
parishioners by the children, the district visitors and the verger, the
collection at a special Service, and donations from the feeble-minded
old females elsewhere referred to.By the end of April nearly all the old hands were back at work, and
several casual hands had also been taken on, the Semi-drunk being one
of the number.In addition to these, Misery had taken on a number of
what he called 'lightweights', men who were not really skilled workmen,
but had picked up sufficient knowledge of the simpler parts of the
trade to be able to get over it passably.These were paid fivepence or
fivepence-halfpenny, and were employed in preference to those who had
served their time, because the latter wanted more money and therefore
were only employed when absolutely necessary.Besides the lightweights
there were a few young fellows called improvers, who were also employed
because they were cheap.Crass now acted as colourman, having been appointed possibly because he
knew absolutely nothing about the laws of colour.As most of the work
consisted of small jobs, all the paint and distemper was mixed up at
the shop and sent out ready for use to the various jobs.Sawkins or some of the other lightweights generally carried the heavier
lots of colour or scaffolding, but the smaller lots of colour or such
things as a pair of steps or a painter's plank were usually sent by the
boy, whose slender legs had become quite bowed since he had been
engaged helping the other philanthropists to make money for Mr Rushton.Crass's work as colourman was simplified, to a certain extent, by the
great number of specially prepared paints and distempers in all
colours, supplied by the manufacturers ready for use.Most of these
new-fangled concoctions were regarded with an eye of suspicion and
dislike by the hands, and Philpot voiced the general opinion about them
one day during a dinner-hour discussion when he said they might appear
to be all right for a time, but they would probably not last, because
they was mostly made of kimicles.One of these new-fashioned paints was called 'Petrifying Liquid', and
was used for first-coating decaying stone or plaster work.It was also
supposed to be used for thinning up a certain kind of patent distemper,
but when Misery found out that it was possible to thin the latter with
water, the use of 'Petrifying Liquid' for that purpose was
discontinued.This 'Petrifying Liquid' was a source of much merriment
to the hands.The name was applied to the tea that they made in
buckets on some of the jobs, and also to the four-ale that was supplied
by certain pubs.One of the new inventions was regarded with a certain amount of
indignation by the hands: it was a white enamel, and they objected to
it for two reasons--one was because, as Philpot remarked, it dried so
quickly that you had to work like greased lightning; you had to be all
over the door directly you started it.The other reason was that, because it dried so quickly, it was
necessary to keep closed the doors and windows of the room where it was
being used, and the smell was so awful that it brought on fits of
dizziness and sometimes vomiting.Needless to say, the fact that it
compelled those who used it to work quickly recommended the stuff to
Misery.As for the smell, he did not care about that; he did not have to inhale
the fumes himself.It was just about this time that Crass, after due consultation with
several of the others, including Philpot, Harlow, Bundy, Slyme, Easton
and the Semi-drunk, decided to call a meeting of the hands for the
purpose of considering the advisability of holding the usual Beano
later on in the summer.The meeting was held in the carpenter's shop
down at the yard one evening at six o'clock, which allowed time for
those interested to attend after leaving work.The hands sat on the benches or carpenter's stools, or reclined upon
heaps of shavings.On a pair of tressels in the centre of the workshop
stood a large oak coffin which Crass had just finished polishing.When all those who were expected to turn up had arrived, Payne, the
foreman carpenter--the man who made the coffins--was voted to the chair
on the proposition of Crass, seconded by Philpot, and then a solemn
silence ensued, which was broken at last by the chairman, who, in a
lengthy speech, explained the object of the meeting.Possibly with a
laudable desire that there should be no mistake about it, he took the
trouble to explain several times, going over the same ground and
repeating the same words over and over again, whilst the audience
waited in a deathlike and miserable silence for him to leave off.Payne, however, did not appear to have any intention of leaving off,
for he continued, like a man in a trance, to repeat what he had said
before, seeming to be under the impression that he had to make a
separate explanation to each individual member of the audience.At
last the crowd could stand it no longer, and began to shout 'Hear,
hear' and to bang bits of wood and hammers on the floor and the
benches; and then, after a final repetition of the statement, that the
object of the meeting was to consider the advisability of holding an
outing, or beanfeast, the chairman collapsed on to a carpenter's stool
and wiped the sweat from his forehead.Crass then reminded the meeting that the last year's Beano had been an
unqualified success, and for his part he would be very sorry if they
did not have one this year.Last year they had four brakes, and they
went to Tubberton Village.It was true that there was nothing much to see at Tubberton, but there
was one thing they could rely on getting there that they could not be
sure of getting for the same money anywhere else, and that was--a good
feed.Just for the sake of getting on with the business,
he would propose that they decide to go to Tubberton, and that a
committee be appointed to make arrangements--about the dinner--with the
landlord of the Queen Elizabeth's Head at that place.Philpot seconded the motion, and Payne was about to call for a show of
hands when Harlow rose to a point of order.It appeared to him that
they were getting on a bit too fast.The proper way to do this
business was first to take the feeling of the meeting as to whether
they wished to have a Beano at all, and then, if the meeting was in
favour of it, they could decide where they were to go, and whether they
would have a whole day or only half a day.The Semi-drunk said that he didn't care a dreadful expression where
they went: he was willing to abide by the decision of the majority.It was a matter of indifference to him whether they had a
day, or half a day, or two days; he was agreeable to anything.Easton suggested that a special saloon carriage might be engaged, and
they could go and visit Madame Tussaud's Waxworks.He had never been
to that place and had often wished to see it.But Philpot objected
that if they went there, Madame Tussaud's might be unwilling to let
them out again.Bundy endorsed the remarks that had fallen from Crass with reference to
Tubberton.He did not care where they went, they would never get such
a good spread for the money as they did last year at the Queen
Elizabeth.The chairman said that he remembered the last Beano very well.They
had half a day--left off work on Saturday at twelve instead of one--so
there was only one hour's wages lost--they went home, had a wash and
changed their clothes, and got up to the Cricketers, where the brakes
was waiting, at one.Then they had the two hours' drive to Tubberton,
stopping on the way for drinks at the Blue Lion, the Warrior's Head,
the Bird in Hand, the Dewdrop Inn and the World Turned Upside Down.They arrived at the Queen Elizabeth at three-thirty, and
the dinner was ready; and it was one of the finest blow-outs he had
ever had.There was soup, vegetables, roast beef, roast
mutton, lamb and mint sauce, plum duff, Yorkshire, and a lot more.The
landlord of the Elizabeth kept as good a drop of beer as anyone could
wish to drink, and as for the teetotallers, they could have tea, coffee
or ginger beer.Having thus made another start, Payne found it very difficult to leave
off, and was proceeding to relate further details of the last Beano
when Harlow again rose up from his heap of shavings and said he wished
to call the chairman to order.What the hell was the
use of all this discussion before they had even decided to have a Beano
at all!Was the meeting in favour of a Beano or not?Everyone was very
uncomfortable, looking stolidly on the ground or staring straight in
front of them.At last Easton broke the silence by suggesting that it would not be a
bad plan if someone was to make a motion that a Beano be held.This
was greeted with a general murmur of 'Hear, hear,' followed by another
awkward pause, and then the chairman asked Easton if he would move a
resolution to that effect.After some hesitation, Easton agreed, and
formally moved: 'That this meeting is in favour of a Beano.'The Semi-drunk said that, in order to get on with the business, he
would second the resolution.But meantime, several arguments had
broken out between the advocates of different places, and several men
began to relate anecdotes of previous Beanos.Nearly everyone was
speaking at once and it was some time before the chairman was able to
put the resolution.Finding it impossible to make his voice heard
above the uproar, he began to hammer on the bench with a wooden mallet,
and to shout requests for order, but this only served to increase the
din.Some of them looked at him curiously and wondered what was the
matter with him, but the majority were so interested in their own
arguments that they did not notice him at all.Whilst the chairman was trying to get the attention of the meeting in
order to put the question, Bundy had become involved in an argument
with several of the new hands who claimed to know of an even better
place than the Queen Elizabeth, a pub called 'The New Found Out', at
Mirkfield, a few miles further on than Tubberton, and another
individual joined in the dispute, alleging that a house called 'The
Three Loggerheads' at Slushton-cum-Dryditch was the finest place for a
Beano within a hundred miles of Mugsborough.He went there last year
with Pushem and Driver's crowd, and they had roast beef, goose, jam
tarts, mince pies, sardines, blancmange, calves' feet jelly and one
pint for each man was included in the cost of the dinner.In the
middle of the discussion, they noticed that most of the others were
holding up their hands, so to show there was no ill feeling they held
up theirs also and then the chairman declared it was carried
unanimously.Bundy said he would like to ask the chairman to read out the resolution
which had just been passed, as he had not caught the words.The chairman replied that there was no written resolution.The motion
was just to express the feeling of this meeting as to whether there was
to be an outing or not.Bundy said he was only asking a civil question, a point of information:
all he wanted to know was, what was the terms of the resolution?Was
they in favour of the Beano or not?The chairman responded that the meeting was unanimously in favour.Harlow said that the next thing to be done was to decide upon the date.That would give them
plenty of time to pay in.Sawkins asked whether it was proposed to have a day or only half a day.He himself was in favour of the whole day.It would only mean losing a
morning's work.It was hardly worth going at all if they only had half
the day.The Semi-drunk remarked that he had just thought of a very good place
to go if they decided to have a change.Three years ago he was working
for Dauber and Botchit and they went to 'The First In and the Last Out'
at Bashford.It was a very small place, but there was a field where
you could have a game of cricket or football, and the dinner was A1 at
Lloyds.There was also a skittle alley attached to the pub and no
charge was made for the use of it.There was a bit of a river there,
and one of the chaps got so drunk that he went orf his onion and jumped
into the water, and when they got him out the village policeman locked
him up, and the next day he was took before the beak and fined two
pounds or a month's hard labour for trying to commit suicide.Easton pointed out that there was another way to look at it: supposing
they decided to have the Beano, he supposed it would come to about six
shillings a head.If they had it at the end of August and started
paying in now, say a tanner a week, they would have plenty of time to
make up the amount, but supposing the work fell off and some of them
got the push?Crass said that in that case a man could either have his money back or
he could leave it, and continue his payments even if he were working
for some other firm; the fact that he was off from Rushton's would not
prevent him from going to the Beano.Harlow proposed that they decide to go to the Queen Elizabeth the same
as last year, and that they have half a day.Philpot said that, in order to get on with the business, he would
second the resolution.Bundy suggested--as an amendment--that it should be a whole day,
starting from the Cricketers at nine in the morning, and Sawkins said
that, in order to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment.One of the new hands said he wished to move another amendment.He
proposed to strike out the Queen Elizabeth and substitute the Three
Loggerheads.The Chairman--after a pause--inquired if there were any seconder to
this, and the Semi-drunk said that, although he did not care much where
they went, still, to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment, although for his own part he would prefer to go to the
'First In and Last Out' at Bashford.The new hand offered to withdraw his suggestion re the Three
Loggerheads in favour of the Semi-drunks proposition, but the latter
said it didn't matter; it could go as it was.As it was getting rather late, several men went home, and cries of 'Put
the question' began to be heard on all sides; the chairman accordingly
was proceeding to put Harlow's proposition when the new hand
interrupted him by pointing out that it was his duty as chairman to put
the amendments first.This produced another long discussion, in the
course of which a very tall, thin man who had a harsh, metallic voice
gave a long rambling lecture about the rules of order and the conduct
of public meetings.He spoke very slowly and deliberately, using very
long words and dealing with the subject in an exhaustive manner.A
resolution was a resolution, and an amendment was an amendment; then
there was what was called an amendment to an amendment; the procedure
of the House of Commons differed very materially from that of the House
of Lords--and so on.This man kept on talking for about ten minutes, and might have
continued for ten hours if he had not been rudely interrupted by
Harlow, who said that it seemed to him that they were likely to stay
there all night if they went on like they were going.He wanted his
tea, and he would also like to get a few hours' sleep before having to
resume work in the morning.He was getting about sick of all this
talk.In order to get on with the business, he would
withdraw his resolution if the others would withdraw their amendments.If they would agree to do this, he would then propose another
resolution which--if carried--would meet all the requirements of the
case.The man with the metallic voice observed that it was not necessary to
ask the consent of those who had moved amendments: if the original
proposition was withdrawed, all the amendments fell to the ground.'Last year,' observed Crass, 'when we was goin' out of the room after
we'd finished our dinner at the Queen Elizabeth, the landlord pointed
to the table and said, "There's enough left over for you all to 'ave
another lot."'Harlow said that he would move that it be held on the last Saturday in
August; that it be for half a day, starting at one o'clock so that they
could work up till twelve, which would mean that they would only have
to lose one hour's pay: that they go to the same place as last
year--the Queen Elizabeth.That the same committee that
acted last year--Crass and Bundy--be appointed to make all the
arrangements and collect the subscriptions.The tall man observed that this was what was called a compound
resolution, and was proceeding to explain further when the chairman
exclaimed that it did not matter a dam' what it was called--would
anyone second it?The Semi-drunk said that he would--in order to get
on with the business.Bundy moved, and Sawkins seconded, as an amendment, that it should be a
whole day.The new hand moved to substitute the Loggerheads for the Queen
Elizabeth.Easton proposed to substitute Madame Tussaud's Waxworks for the Queen
Elizabeth.He said he moved this just to test the feeling of the
meeting.Harlow pointed out that it would cost at least a pound a head to defray
the expenses of such a trip.The railway fares, tram fares in London,
meals--for it would be necessary to have a whole day--and other
incidental expenses; to say nothing of the loss of wages.It would not
be possible for any of them to save the necessary amount during the
next four months.Philpot repeated his warning as to the danger of visiting Madame
Tussaud's.He was certain that if she once got them in there she would
never let them out again.He had no desire to pass the rest of his
life as an image in a museum.One of the new hands--a man with a red tie--said that they would look
well, after having been soaked for a month or two in petrifying liquid,
chained up in the Chamber of Horrors with labels round their
necks--'Specimens of Liberal and Conservative upholders of the
Capitalist System, 20 century'.Crass protested against the introduction of politics into that meeting.The remarks of the last speakers were most uncalled-for.Easton said that he would withdraw his amendment.Acting under the directions of the man with the metallic voice, the
chairman now proceeded to put the amendment to the vote.Bundy's
proposal that it should be a whole day was defeated, only himself,
Sawkins and the Semi-drunk being in favour.The motion to substitute
the Loggerheads for the Queen Elizabeth was also defeated, and the
compound resolution proposed by Harlow was then carried nem.Philpot now proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman for the
very able manner in which he had conducted the meeting.When this had
been unanimously agreed to, the Semi-drunk moved a similar tribute of
gratitude to Crass for his services to the cause and the meeting
dispersed.Chapter 42

June


During the early part of May the weather was exceptionally bad, with
bitterly cold winds.Rain fell nearly every day, covering the roads
with a slush that penetrated the rotten leather of the cheap or
second-hand boots worn by the workmen.This weather had the effect of
stopping nearly all outside work, and also caused a lot of illness, for
those who were so fortunate as to have inside jobs frequently got wet
through on their way to work in the morning and had to work all day in
damp clothing, and with their boots saturated with water.It was also
a source of trouble to those of the men who had allotments, because if
it had been fine they would have been able to do something to their
gardens while they were out of work.Newman had not succeeded in getting a job at the trade since he came
out of prison, but he tried to make a little money by hawking bananas.Philpot--when he was at work--used often to buy a tanner's or a bob's
worth from him and give them to Mrs Linden's children.On Saturdays
Old Joe used to waylay these children and buy them bags of cakes at the
bakers.One week when he knew that Mrs Linden had not had much work to
do, he devised a very cunning scheme to help her.He had been working
with Slyme, who was papering a large boarded ceiling in a shop.It had
to be covered with unbleached calico before it could be papered and
when the work was done there were a number of narrow pieces of calico
left over.These he collected and tore into strips about six inches
wide which he took round to Mrs Linden, and asked her to sew them
together, end to end, so as to make one long strip: then this long
strip had to be cut into four pieces of equal length and the edges sewn
together in such a manner that it would form a long tube.Philpot told
her that it was required for some work that Rushton's were doing, and
said he had undertaken to get the sewing done.The firm would have to
pay for it, so she could charge a good price.'You see,' he said with a wink, 'this is one of those jobs where we
gets a chance to get some of our own back.'Mary thought it was rather a strange sort of job, but she did as
Philpot directed and when he came for the stuff and asked how much it
was she said threepence: it had only taken about half an hour.Philpot
ridiculed this: it was not nearly enough.THEY were not supposed to
know how long it took: it ought to be a bob at the very least.So,
after some hesitation she made out a bill for that amount on a
half-sheet of note-paper.He brought her the money the next Saturday
afternoon and went off chuckling to himself over the success of the
scheme.It did not occur to him until the next day that he might just
as well have got her to make him an apron or two: and when he did think
of this he said that after all it didn't matter, because if he had done
that it would have been necessary to buy new calico, and anyhow, it
could be done some other time.Newman did not make his fortune out of the bananas--seldom more than
two shillings a day--and consequently he was very glad when Philpot
called at his house one evening and told him there was a chance of a
job at Rushton's.Newman accordingly went to the yard the next
morning, taking his apron and blouse and his bag of tools with him,
ready to start work.He got there at about quarter to six and was
waiting outside when Hunter arrived.The latter was secretly very glad
to see him, for there was a rush of work in and they were short of men.He did not let this appear, of course, but hesitated for a few minutes
when Newman repeated the usual formula: 'Any chance of a job, sir?''We wasn't at all satisfied with you last time you was on, you know,'
said Misery.'Still, I don't mind giving you another chance.But if
you want to hold your job you'll have to move yourself a bit quicker
than you did before.'Towards the end of the month things began to improve all round.As time went on the improvement
was maintained and nearly everyone was employed.Rushton's were so busy
that they took on several other old hands who had been sacked the
previous year for being too slow.Thanks to the influence of Crass, Easton was now regarded as one of the
regular hands.He had recently resumed the practice of spending some
of his evenings at the Cricketers.It is probable that even if it had
not been for his friendship with Crass, he would still have continued
to frequent the public house, for things were not very comfortable at
home.Somehow or other, Ruth and he seemed to be always quarrelling,
and he was satisfied that it was not always his fault.Sometimes,
after the day's work was over he would go home resolved to be good
friends with her: he would plan on his way homewards to suggest to her
that they should have their tea and then go out for a walk with the
child.Once or twice she agreed, but on each occasion, they quarrelled
before they got home again.So after a time he gave up trying to be
friends with her and went out by himself every evening as soon as he
had had his tea.Mary Linden, who was still lodging with them, could not help perceiving
their unhappiness: she frequently noticed that Ruth's eyes were red and
swollen as if with crying, and she gently sought to gain her
confidence, but without success.On one occasion when Mary was trying
to advise her, Ruth burst out into a terrible fit of weeping, but she
would not say what was the cause--except that her head was aching--she
was not well, that was all.Sometimes Easton passed the evening at the Cricketers but frequently he
went over to the allotments, where Harlow had a plot of ground.Harlow
used to get up about four o'clock in the morning and put in an hour or
so at his garden before going to work; and every evening as soon as he
had finished tea he used to go there again and work till it was dark.Sometimes he did not go home to tea at all, but went straight from work
to the garden, and his children used to bring his tea to him there in a
glass bottle, with something to eat in a little basket.He had four
children, none of whom were yet old enough to go to work, and as may be
imagined, he found it a pretty hard struggle to live.He was not a
teetotaller, but as he often remarked, 'what the publicans got from him
wouldn't make them very fat', for he often went for weeks together
without tasting the stuff, except a glass or two with the Sunday
dinner, which he did not regard as an unnecessary expense, because it
was almost as cheap as tea or coffee.Fortunately his wife was a good needlewoman, and as sober and
industrious as himself; by dint of slaving incessantly from morning
till night she managed to keep her home fairly comfortable and the
children clean and decently dressed; they always looked respectable,
although they did not always have enough proper food to eat.They
looked so respectable that none of the 'visiting ladies' ever regarded
them as deserving cases.Harlow paid fifteen shillings a year for his plot of ground, and
although it meant a lot of hard work it was also a source of pleasure
and some profit.He generally made a few shillings out of the flowers,
besides having enough potatoes and other vegetables to last them nearly
all the year.Sometimes Easton went over to the allotments and lent Harlow a hand
with this gardening work, but whether he went there or to the
Cricketers, he usually returned home about half past nine, and then
went straight to bed, often without speaking a single word to Ruth, who
for her part seldom spoke to him except to answer something he said, or
to ask some necessary question.At first, Easton used to think that it
was all because of the way he had behaved to her in the public house,
but when he apologized--as he did several times--and begged her to
forgive him and forget about it, she always said it was all right;
there was nothing to forgive.Then, after a time, he began to think it
was on account of their poverty and the loss of their home, for nearly
all their furniture had been sold during the last winter.But whenever
he talked of trying to buy some more things to make the place
comfortable again, she did not appear to take any interest: the house
was neat enough as it was: they could manage very well, she said,
indifferently.One evening, about the middle of June, when he had been over to the
allotments, Easton brought her home a bunch of flowers that Harlow had
given him--some red and white roses and some <DW29>s.When he came in,
Ruth was packing his food basket for the next day.The baby was asleep
in its cot on the floor near the window.Although it was nearly nine
o'clock the lamp had not yet been lighted and the mournful twilight
that entered the room through the open window increased the desolation
of its appearance.The fire had burnt itself out and the grate was
filled with ashes.On the hearth was an old rug made of jute that had
once been printed in bright colours which had faded away till the whole
surface had become almost uniformly drab, showing scarcely any trace of
the original pattern.The rest of the floor was bare except for two or
three small pieces of old carpet that Ruth had bought for a few pence
at different times at some inferior second-hand shop.The chairs and
the table were almost the only things that were left of the original
furniture of the room, and except for three or four plates of different
patterns and sizes and a few cups and saucers, the shelves of the
dresser were bare.The stillness of the atmosphere was disturbed only by the occasional
sound of the wheels of a passing vehicle and the strangely distinct
voices of some children who were playing in the street.'I've brought you these,' said Easton, offering her the flowers.You know I've been
helping him a little with his garden.'At first he thought she did not want to take them.She was standing at
the table with her back to the window, so that he was unable to see the
expression of her face, and she hesitated for a moment before she
faltered out some words of thanks and took the flowers, which she put
down on the table almost as soon as she touched them.Offended at what he considered her contemptuous indifference, Easton
made no further attempt at conversation but went into the scullery to
wash his hands, and then went up to bed.Downstairs, for a long time after he was gone, Ruth sat alone by the
fireless grate, in the silence and the gathering shadows, holding the
bunch of flowers in her hand, living over again the events of the last
year, and consumed with an agony of remorse.The presence of Mary Linden and the two children in the house probably
saved Ruth from being more unhappy than she was.Little Elsie had made
an arrangement with her to be allowed to take the baby out for walks,
and in return Ruth did Elsie's housework.As for Mary, she had not
much time to do anything but sew, almost the only relaxation she knew
being when she took the work home, and on Sunday, which she usually
devoted to a general clean-up of the room, and to mending the
children's clothes.Sometimes on Sunday evening she used to go with
Ruth and the children to see Mrs Owen, who, although she was not ill
enough to stay in bed, seldom went out of the house.She had never
really recovered from the attack of illness which was brought on by her
work at the boarding house.The doctor had been to see her once or
twice and had prescribed--rest.She was to lie down as much as
possible, not to do any heavy work--not to carry or lift any heavy
articles, scrub floors, make beds, or anything of that sort: and she
was to take plenty of nourishing food, beef tea, chicken, a little wine
and so on.He did not suggest a trip round the world in a steam yacht
or a visit to Switzerland--perhaps he thought they might not be able to
afford it.Sometimes she was so ill that she had to observe one at
least of the doctor's instructions--to lie down: and then she would
worry and fret because she was not able to do the housework and because
Owen had to prepare his own tea when he came home at night.On one of
these occasions it would have been necessary for Owen to stay at home
from work if it had not been for Mrs Easton, who came for several days
in succession to look after her and attend to the house.Fortunately, Owen's health was better since the weather had become
warmer.For a long time after the attack of haemorrhage he had while
writing the show-card he used to dread going to sleep at night for fear
it should recur.He had heard of people dying in their sleep from that
cause.Nora knew nothing of what
occurred that night: to have told her would have done no good, but on
the contrary would have caused her a lot of useless anxiety.Sometimes
he doubted whether it was right not to tell her, but as time went by
and his health continued to improve he was glad he had said nothing
about it.Frankie had lately resumed his athletic exercises with the flat iron:
his strength was returning since Owen had been working regularly,
because he had been having his porridge and milk again and also some
Parrish's Food which a chemist at Windley was selling large bottles of
for a shilling.He used to have what he called a 'party' two or three
times a week with Elsie, Charley and Easton's baby as the guests.Sometimes, if Mrs Owen were not well, Elsie used to stay in with her
after tea and do some housework while the boys went out to play, but
more frequently the four children used to go together to the park to
play or sail boats on the lake.Once one of the boats was becalmed
about a couple of yards from shore and while trying to reach it with a
stick Frankie fell into the water, and when Charley tried to drag him
out he fell in also.Elsie put the baby down on the bank and seized
hold of Charley and while she was trying to get him out, the baby began
rolling down, and would probably have tumbled in as well if a man who
happened to be passing by had not rushed up in time to prevent it.Fortunately the water at that place was only about two feet deep, so
the boys were not much the worse for their ducking.They returned home
wet through, smothered with mud, and feeling very important, like boys
who had distinguished themselves.After this, whenever she could manage to spare the time, Ruth Easton
used to go with the children to the park.There was a kind of
summer-house near the shore of the lake, only a few feet away from the
water's edge, surrounded and shaded by trees, whose branches arched
over the path and drooped down to the surface of the water.While the
children played Ruth used to sit in this arbour and sew, but often her
work was neglected and forgotten as she gazed pensively at the water,
which just there looked very still, and dark, and deep, for it was
sheltered from the wind and over-shadowed by the trees that lined the
banks at the end of the lake.Sometimes, if it happened to be raining, instead of going out the
children used to have some games in the house.On one such occasion
Frankie produced the flat iron and went through the exercise, and
Charley had a go as well.But although he was slightly older and
taller than Frankie he could not lift the iron so often or hold it out
so long as the other, a failure that Frankie attributed to the fact
that Charley had too much tea and bread and butter instead of porridge
and milk and Parrish's Food.Charley was so upset about his lack of
strength that he arranged with Frankie to come home with him the next
day after school to see his mother about it.Mrs Linden had a flat
iron, so they gave a demonstration of their respective powers before
her.Mrs Easton being also present, by request, because Frankie said
that the diet in question was suitable for babies as well as big
children.He had been brought up on it ever since he could remember,
and it was almost as cheap as bread and butter and tea.The result of the exhibition was that Mrs Linden promised to make
porridge for Charley and Elsie whenever she could spare the time, and
Mrs Easton said she would try it for the baby also.Chapter 43

The Good Old Summer-time


All through the summer the crowd of ragged-trousered philanthropists
continued to toil and sweat at their noble and unselfish task of making
money for Mr Rushton.Painting the outsides of houses and shops, washing off and distempering
ceilings, stripping old paper off walls, painting and papering rooms
and staircases, building new rooms or other additions to old houses or
business premises, digging up old drains, repairing leaky roofs and
broken windows.Their zeal and enthusiasm in the good cause was unbounded.They were
supposed to start work at six o'clock, but most of them were usually to
be found waiting outside the job at about a quarter to that hour,
sitting on the kerbstones or the doorstep.Their operations extended all over the town: at all hours of the day
they were to be seen either going or returning from 'jobs', carrying
ladders, planks, pots of paint, pails of whitewash, earthenware,
chimney pots, drainpipes, lengths of guttering, closet pans, grates,
bundles of wallpaper, buckets of paste, sacks of cement, and loads of
bricks and mortar.Quite a common spectacle--for gods and men--was a
procession consisting of a handcart loaded up with such materials being
pushed or dragged through the public streets by about half a dozen of
these Imperialists in broken boots and with battered, stained,
discoloured bowler hats, or caps splashed with paint and whitewash;
their stand-up collars dirty, limp and crumpled, and their rotten
second-hand misfit clothing saturated with sweat and plastered with
mortar.Even the assistants in the grocers' and drapers' shops laughed and
ridiculed and pointed the finger of scorn at them as they passed.The superior classes--those who do nothing--regarded them as a sort of
lower animals.A letter appeared in the Obscurer one week from one of
these well-dressed loafers, complaining of the annoyance caused to the
better-class visitors by workmen walking on the pavement as they passed
along the Grand Parade in the evening on their way home from work, and
suggesting that they should walk in the roadway.When they heard of
the letter a lot of the workmen adopted the suggestion and walked in
the road so as to avoid contaminating the idlers.This letter was followed by others of a somewhat similar kind, and one
or two written in a patronizing strain in defence of the working
classes by persons who evidently knew nothing about them.There was
also a letter from an individual who signed himself 'Morpheus'
complaining that he was often awakened out of his beauty sleep in the
middle of the night by the clattering noise of the workmen's boots as
they passed his house on their way to work in the morning.'Morpheus'
wrote that not only did they make a dreadful noise with their horrible
iron-clad boots, but they were in the habit of coughing and spitting a
great deal, which was very unpleasant to hear, and they conversed in
loud tones.Sometimes their conversation was not at all edifying, for
it consisted largely of bad language, which 'Morpheus' assumed to be
attributable to the fact that they were out of temper because they had
to rise so early.As a rule they worked till half-past five in the evening, and by the
time they reached home it was six o'clock.When they had taken their
evening meal and had a wash it was nearly eight: about nine most of
them went to bed so as to be able to get up about half past four the
next morning to make a cup of tea before leaving home at half past five
to go to work again.Frequently it happened that they had to leave
home earlier than this, because their 'job' was more than half an
hour's walk away.It did not matter how far away the 'job' was from
the shop, the men had to walk to and fro in their own time, for Trades
Union rules were a dead letter in Mugsborough.There were no tram
fares or train fares or walking time allowed for the likes of them.Ninety-nine out of every hundred of them did not believe in such things
as those: they had much more sense than to join Trades Unions: on the
contrary, they believed in placing themselves entirely at the mercy of
their good, kind Liberal and Tory masters.Very frequently it happened, when only a few men were working together,
that it was not convenient to make tea for breakfast or dinner, and
then some of them brought tea with them ready made in bottles and drank
it cold; but most of them went to the nearest pub and ate their food
there with a glass of beer.Even those who would rather have had tea
or coffee had beer, because if they went to a temperance restaurant or
coffee tavern it generally happened that they were not treated very
civilly unless they bought something to eat as well as to drink, and
the tea at such places was really dearer than beer, and the latter was
certainly quite as good to drink as the stewed tea or the liquid mud
that was sold as coffee at cheap 'Workmen's' Eating Houses.There were some who were--as they thought--exceptionally lucky: the
firms they worked for were busy enough to let them work two hours'
overtime every night--till half past seven--without stopping for tea.Most of these arrived home about eight, completely flattened out.Then
they had some tea and a wash and before they knew where they were it
was about half past nine.Then they went to sleep again till half past
four or five the next morning.They were usually so tired when they got home at night that they never
had any inclination for study or any kind of self-improvement, even if
they had had the time.They had plenty of time to study during the
winter: and their favourite subject then was, how to preserve
themselves from starving to death.This overtime, however, was the exception, for although in former years
it had been the almost invariable rule to work till half past seven in
summer, most of the firms now made a practice of ceasing work at
five-thirty.The revolution which had taken place in this matter was a
favourite topic of conversation amongst the men, who spoke regretfully
of the glorious past, when things were busy, and they used to work
fifteen, sixteen and even eighteen hours a day.But nowadays there
were nearly as many chaps out of work in the summer as in the winter.They used to discuss the causes of the change.One was, of course, the
fact that there was not so much building going on as formerly, and
another was the speeding up and slave-driving, and the manner in which
the work was now done, or rather scamped.As old Philpot said, he
could remember the time, when he was a nipper, when such a 'job' as
that at 'The Cave' would have lasted at least six months, and they
would have had more hands on it too!But it would have been done
properly, not messed up like that was: all the woodwork would have been
rubbed down with pumice stone and water: all the knots cut out and the
holes properly filled up, and the work properly rubbed down with
glass-paper between every coat.But nowadays the only place you'd see
a bit of pumice stone was in a glass case in a museum, with a label on
it.'Pumice Stone: formerly used by house-painters.'Most of them spoke of those bygone times with poignant regret, but
there were a few--generally fellows who had been contaminated by
contact with Socialists or whose characters had been warped and
degraded by the perusal of Socialist literature--who said that they did
not desire to work overtime at all--ten hours a day were quite enough
for them--in fact they would rather do only eight.What they wanted,
they said, was not more work, but more grub, more clothes, more
leisure, more pleasure and better homes.They wanted to be able to go
for country walks or bicycle rides, to go out fishing or to go to the
seaside and bathe and lie on the beach and so forth.But these were
only a very few; there were not many so selfish as this.The majority
desired nothing but to be allowed to work, and as for their children,
why, 'what was good enough for themselves oughter be good enough for
the kids'.They often said that such things as leisure, culture, pleasure and the
benefits of civilization were never intended for 'the likes of us'.They did not--all--actually say this, but that was what their conduct
amounted to; for they not only refused to help to bring about a better
state of things for their children, but they ridiculed and opposed and
cursed and abused those who were trying to do it for them.The foulest
words that came out of their mouths were directed against the men of
their own class in the House of Commons--the Labour Members--and
especially the Socialists, whom they spoke of as fellows who were too
bloody lazy to work for a living, and who wanted the working classes to
keep them.Some of them said that they did not believe in helping their children
to become anything better than their parents had been because in such
cases the children, when they grew up, 'looked down' upon and were
ashamed of their fathers and mothers!They seemed to think that if
they loved and did their duty to their children, the probability was
that the children would prove ungrateful: as if even if that were true,
it would be any excuse for their indifference.Another cause of the shortage of work was the intrusion into the trade
of so many outsiders: fellows like Sawkins and the other lightweights.Whatever other causes there were, there could be no doubt that the
hurrying and scamping was a very real one.Every 'job' had to be done
at once!as if it were a matter of life or death!It must be finished
by a certain time.If the 'job' was at an empty house, Misery's yarn
was that it was let!the people were coming in at the end of the week!therefore everything must be finished by Wednesday night.All the
ceilings had to be washed off, the walls stripped and repapered, and
two coats of paint inside and outside the house.New drains were to be
put in, and all broken windows and locks and broken plaster repaired.A number of men--usually about half as many as there should have
been--would be sent to do the work, and one man was put in charge of
the 'job'.These sub-foremen or 'coddies' knew that if they'made
their jobs pay' they would be put in charge of others and be kept on in
preference to other men as long as the firm had any work; so they
helped Misery to scheme and scamp the work and watched and drove the
men under their charge; and these latter poor wretches, knowing that
their only chance of retaining their employment was to 'tear into it',
tore into it like so many maniacs.Instead of cleaning any parts of
the woodwork that were greasy or very dirty, they brushed them over
with a coat of spirit varnish before painting to make sure that the
paint would dry: places where the plaster of the walls was damaged were
repaired with what was humorously called 'garden cement'--which was the
technical term for dirt out of the garden--and the surface was skimmed
over with proper material.Ceilings that were not very dirty were not
washed off, but dusted, and lightly gone over with a thin coat of
whitewash.The old paper was often left upon the walls of rooms that
were supposed to be stripped before being repapered, and to conceal
this the joints of the old paper were rubbed down so that they should
not be perceptible through the new paper.As far as possible, Misery
and the sub-foreman avoided doing the work the customers paid for, and
even what little they did was hurried over anyhow.A reign of terror--the terror of the sack--prevailed on all the 'jobs',
which were carried on to the accompaniment of a series of alarums and
excursions: no man felt safe for a moment: at the most unexpected times
Misery would arrive and rush like a whirlwind all over the 'job'.If
he happened to find a man having a spell the culprit was immediately
discharged, but he did not get the opportunity of doing this very often
for everybody was too terrified to leave off working even for a few
minutes' rest.From the moment of Hunter's arrival until his departure, a state of
panic, hurry, scurry and turmoil reigned.His strident voice rang
through the house as he bellowed out to them to 'Rouse themselves!We've got another job to
start when you've done this!'Occasionally, just to keep the others up to concert pitch, he used to
sack one of the men for being too slow.They all trembled before him
and ran about whenever he spoke to or called them, because they knew
that there were always a lot of other men out of work who would be
willing and eager to fill their places if they got the sack.Although it was now summer, and the Distress Committee and all the
other committees had suspended operations, there was still always a
large number of men hanging about the vicinity of the Fountain on the
Parade--The Wage Slave Market.When men finished up for the firm they
were working for they usually made for that place.Any master in want
of a wage slave for a few hours, days or weeks could always buy one
there.The men knew this and they also knew that if they got the sack
from one firm it was no easy matter to get another job, and that was
why they were terrified.When Misery was gone--to repeat the same performance at some other
job--the sub-foreman would have a crawl round to see how the chaps were
getting on: to find out if they had used up all their paint yet, or to
bring them some putty so that they should not have to leave their work
to go to get anything themselves: and then very often Rushton himself
would come and stalk quietly about the house or stand silently behind
the men, watching them as they worked.He seldom spoke to anyone, but
just stood there like a graven image, or walked about like a dumb
animal--a pig, as the men used to say.This individual had a very
exalted idea of his own importance and dignity.One man got the sack
for presuming to stop him in the street to ask some questions about
some work that was being done.Misery went round to all the jobs the next day and told all the
'coddies' to tell all the hands that they were never to speak to Mr
Rushton if they met him in the street, and the following Saturday the
man who had so offended was given his back day, ostensibly because
there was nothing for him to do, but really for the reason stated above.There was one job, the outside of a large house that stood on elevated
ground overlooking the town.The men who were working there were even
more than usually uncomfortable, for it was said that Rushton used to
sit in his office and watch them through a telescope.Sometimes, when it was really necessary to get a job done by a certain
time, they had to work late, perhaps till eight or nine o'clock.No
time was allowed for tea, but some of them brought sufficient food with
them in the morning to enable them to have a little about six o'clock
in the evening.Others arranged for their children to bring them some
tea from home.As a rule, they partook of this without stopping work:
they had it on the floor beside them and ate and drank and worked at
the same time--a paint-brushful of white lead in one hand, and a piece
of bread and margarine in the other.On some jobs, if the 'coddy'
happened to be a decent sort, they posted a sentry to look out for
Hunter or Rushton while the others knocked off for a few minutes to
snatch a mouthful of grub; but it was not safe always to do this, for
there was often some crawling sneak with an ambition to become a
'coddy' who would not scruple to curry favour with Misery by reporting
the crime.As an additional precaution against the possibility of any of the men
idling or wasting their time, each one was given a time-sheet on which
he was required to account for every minute of the day.The form of
these sheets vary slightly with different firms: that of Rushton & Co.,
was as shown.TIME SHEET

One Monday morning Misery gave each of the sub-foremen an envelope
containing one of the firm's memorandum forms.Crass opened his and
found the following:

Crass

When you are on a job with men under you, check and initial their
time-sheets every night.If they are called away and sent to some other job, or stood off, check
and initial their time-sheets as they leave your job.Any man coming on your job during the day, you must take note of the
exact time of his arrival, and see that his sheet is charged right.Any man who is slow or lazy, or any man that you notice talking more
than is necessary during working hours, you must report him to Mr
Hunter.We expect you and the other foremen to help us to carry out
these rules, AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN US ABOUT ANY MAN IS TREATED IN
CONFIDENCE.Note: This applies to all men of all trades who come on the jobs of
which you are the foreman.Every week the time-sheets were scrutinized, and every now and then a
man would be 'had up on the carpet' in the office before Rushton and
Misery, and interrogated as to why he had taken fifteen hours to do ten
hours work?In the event of the accused being unable to give a
satisfactory explanation of his conduct he was usually sacked on the
spot.Misery was frequently called 'up on the carpet' himself.If he made a mistake in figuring out a 'job', and gave in too high a
tender for it, so that the firm did not get the work, Rushton grumbled.If the price was so low that there was not enough profit, Rushton was
very unpleasant about it, and whenever it happened that there was not
only no profit but an actual loss, Rushton created such a terrible
disturbance that Misery was nearly frightened to death and used to get
on his bicycle and rush off to the nearest 'job' and howl and bellow at
the 'chaps' to get it done.All the time the capabilities of the men--especially with regard to
speed--were carefully watched and noted: and whenever there was a
slackness of work and it was necessary to discharge some hands those
that were slow or took too much pains were weeded out: this of course
was known to the men and it had the desired effect upon them.In justice to Rushton and Hunter, it must be remembered that there was
a certain amount of excuse for all this driving and cheating, because
they had to compete with all the other firms, who conducted their
business in precisely the same way.It was not their fault, but the
fault of the system.A dozen firms tendered for every 'job', and of course the lowest tender
usually obtained the work.Knowing this, they all cut the price down
to the lowest possible figure and the workmen had to suffer.The trouble was that there were too many'masters'.It would have been
far better for the workmen if nine out of every ten of the employers
had never started business.Then the others would have been able to
get a better price for their work, and the men might have had better
wages and conditions.The hands, however, made no such allowances or
excuses as these for Misery and Rushton.They never thought or spoke
of them except with hatred and curses.But whenever either of them
came to the 'job' the 'coddies' cringed and grovelled before them,
greeting them with disgustingly servile salutations, plentifully
interspersed with the word 'Sir', greetings which were frequently
either ignored altogether or answered with an inarticulate grunt.They
said 'Sir' at nearly every second word: it made one feel sick to hear
them because it was not courtesy: they were never courteous to each
other, it was simply abject servility and self-contempt.One of the results of all the frenzied hurrying was that every now and
then there was an accident: somebody got hurt: and it was strange that
accidents were not more frequent, considering the risks that were
taken.When they happened to be working on ladders in busy streets
they were not often allowed to have anyone to stand at the foot, and
the consequence was that all sorts and conditions of people came into
violent collision with the bottoms of the ladders.Small boys playing
in the reckless manner characteristic of their years rushed up against
them.Errand boys, absorbed in the perusal of penny instalments of the
adventures of Claude Duval, and carrying large baskets of
green-groceries, wandered into them.People with large feet became
entangled in them.Fat persons of both sexes who thought it unlucky to
walk underneath, tried to negotiate the narrow strip of pavement
between the foot of the ladder and the kerb, and in their passage
knocked up against the ladder and sometimes fell into the road.Nursemaids wheeling perambulators--lolling over the handle, which they
usually held with their left hands, the right holding a copy of Orange
Blossoms or some halfpenny paper, and so interested in the story of the
Marquis of Lymejuice--a young man of noble presence and fabulous
wealth, with a drooping golden moustache and very long legs, who,
notwithstanding the diabolical machinations of Lady Sibyl Malvoise, who
loves him as well as a woman with a name like that is capable of loving
anyone, is determined to wed none other than the scullery-maid at the
Village Inn--inevitably bashed the perambulators into the ladders.Even when the girls were not reading they nearly always ran into the
ladders, which seemed to possess a magnetic attraction for
perambulators and go-carts of all kinds, whether propelled by nurses or
mothers.Sometimes they would advance very cautiously towards the
ladder: then, when they got very near, hesitate a little whether to go
under or run the risk of falling into the street by essaying the narrow
passage: then they would get very close up to the foot of the ladder,
and dodge and dance about, and give the cart little pushes from side to
side, until at last the magnetic influence exerted itself and the
perambulator crashed into the ladder, perhaps at the very moment that
the man at the top was stretching out to do some part of the work
almost beyond his reach.Once Harlow had just started painting some rainpipes from the top of a
40-ft ladder when one of several small boys who were playing in the
street ran violently against the foot.Harlow was so startled that he
dropped his brushes and clutched wildly at the ladder, which turned
completely round and slid about six feet along the parapet into the
angle of the wall, with Harlow hanging beneath by his hands.The paint
pot was hanging by a hook from one of the rungs, and the jerk scattered
the brown paint it contained all over Harlow and all over the brickwork
of the front of the house.He managed to descend safely by clasping
his legs round the sides of the ladder and sliding down.When Misery
came there was a row about what he called carelessness.And the next
day Harlow had to wear his Sunday trousers to work.On another occasion they were painting the outside of a house called
'Gothic Lodge'.At one corner it had a tower surmounted by a spire or
steeple, and this steeple terminated with an ornamental wrought-iron
pinnacle which had to be painted.The ladder they had was not quite
long enough, and besides that, as it had to stand in a sort of a
courtyard at the base of the tower, it was impossible to slant it
sufficiently: instead of lying along the roof of the steeple, it was
sticking up in the air.When Easton went up to paint the pinnacle he had to stand on almost the
very top rung of the ladder, to be exact, the third from the top, and
lean over to steady himself by holding on to the pinnacle with his left
hand while he used the brush with his right.As it was only about
twenty minutes' work there were two men to hold the foot of the ladder.It was cheaper to do it this way than to rig up a proper scaffold,
which would have entailed perhaps two hours' work for two or three men.John travelled to the bedroom.Of course it was very dangerous, but that did not matter at all,
because even if the man fell it would make no difference to the
firm--all the men were insured and somehow or other, although they
frequently had narrow escapes, they did not often come to grief.On this occasion, just as Easton was finishing he felt the pinnacle
that he was holding on to give way, and he got such a fright that his
heart nearly stopped beating.He let go his hold and steadied himself
on the ladder as well as he was able, and when he had descended three
or four steps--into comparative safety--he remained clinging
convulsively to the ladder and feeling so limp that he was unable to go
down any further for several minutes.When he arrived at the bottom
and the others noticed how white and trembling he was, he told them
about the pinnacle being loose, and the 'coddy' coming along just then,
they told him about it, and suggested that it should be repaired, as
otherwise it might fall down and hurt someone: but the 'coddy' was
afraid that if they reported it they might be blamed for breaking it,
and the owner might expect the firm to put it right for nothing, so
they decided to say nothing about it.The pinnacle is still on the
apex of the steeple waiting for a sufficiently strong wind to blow it
down on somebody's head.When the other men heard of Easton's 'narrow shave', most of them said
that it would have served him bloody well right if he had fallen and
broken his neck: he should have refused to go up at all without a
proper scaffold.If Misery or the
coddy had ordered any of THEM to go up and paint the pinnacle off that
ladder, they would have chucked their tools down and demanded their
ha'pence!That was what they said, but somehow or other it never happened that
any of them ever 'chucked their tools down' at all, although such
dangerous jobs were of very frequent occurrence.The scamping business was not confined to houses or properties of an
inferior class: it was the general rule.Large good-class houses,
villas and mansions, the residences of wealthy people, were done in
exactly the same way.Generally in such places costly and beautiful
materials were spoilt in the using.There was a large mansion where the interior woodwork--the doors,
windows and staircase--had to be finished in white enamel.It was
rather an old house and the woodwork needed rubbing down and filling up
before being repainted, but of course there was not time for that, so
they painted it without properly preparing it and when it was enamelled
the rough, uneven surface of the wood looked horrible: but the owner
appeared quite satisfied because it was nice and shiny.The
dining-room of the same house was papered with a beautiful and
expensive plush paper.The ground of this wall-hanging was made to
imitate crimson watered silk, and it was covered with a raised pattern
in plush of the same colour.The price marked on the back of this
paper in the pattern book was eighteen shillings a roll.Slyme was
paid sixpence a roll for hanging it: the room took ten rolls, so it
cost nine pounds for the paper and five shillings to hang it!To fix
such a paper as this properly the walls should first be done with a
plain lining paper of the same colour as the ground of the wallpaper
itself, because unless the paperhanger 'lapps' the joints--which should
not be done--they are apt to open a little as the paper dries and to
show the white wall underneath--Slyme suggested this lining to Misery,
who would not entertain the idea for a moment--they had gone to quite
enough expense as it was, stripping the old paper off!So Slyme went ahead, and as he had to make his wages, he could not
spend a great deal of time over it.Some of the joints were 'lapped'
and some were butted, and two or three weeks after the owner of the
house moved in, as the paper became more dry, the joints began to open
and to show the white plaster of the wall, and then Owen had to go
there with a small pot of crimson paint and a little brush, and touch
out the white line.While he was doing this he noticed and touched up a number of other
faults; places where Slyme--in his haste to get the work done--had
slobbered and smeared the face of the paper with fingermarks and paste.The same ghastly mess was made of several other 'jobs' besides this
one, and presently they adopted the plan of painting strips of colour
on the wall in the places where the joints would come, so that if they
opened the white wall would not show: but it was found that the paste
on the back of the paper dragged the paint off the wall, and when the
joints opened the white streaks showed all the same, so Misery
abandoned all attempts to prevent joints showing, and if a customer
complained, he sent someone to 'touch it up': but the lining paper was
never used, unless the customer or the architect knew enough about the
work to insist upon it.In other parts of the same house the ceilings, the friezes, and the
dados, were covered with 'embossed' or'relief' papers.These hangings
require very careful handling, for the raised parts are easily damaged;
but the men who fixed them were not allowed to take the pains and time
necessary to make good work: consequently in many places--especially at
the joints--the pattern was flattened out and obliterated.The ceiling of the drawing-room was done with a very thick high-relief
paper that was made in sheets about two feet square.These squares
were not very true in shape: they had evidently warped in drying after
manufacture: to make them match anything like properly would need
considerable time and care.But the men were not allowed to take the
necessary time.The result was that when it was finished it presented
a sort of 'higgledy-piggledy' appearance.But it didn't matter:
nothing seemed to matter except to get it done.One would think from
the way the hands were driven and chivvied and hurried over the work
that they were being paid five or six shillings an hour instead of as
many pence.'For God's sake
get it done!We're losing money over this
"job"!If you chaps don't wake up and move a bit quicker, I shall see
if I can't get somebody else who will.'These costly embossed decorations were usually finished in white; but
instead of carefully coating them with specially prepared paint of
patent distemper, which would need two or three coats, they slobbered
one thick coat of common whitewash on to it with ordinary whitewash
brushes.This was a most economical way to get over it, because it made it
unnecessary to stop up the joints beforehand--the whitewash filled up
all the cracks: and it also filled up the hollow parts, the crevices
and interstices of the ornament, destroying the sharp outlines of the
beautiful designs and reducing the whole to a lumpy, formless mass.But
that did not matter either, so long as they got it done.The architect didn't notice it, because he knew that the more Rushton &
Co.made out of the 'job', the more he himself would make.The man who had to pay for the work didn't notice it; he had the
fullest confidence in the architect.At the risk of wearying the long-suffering reader, mention must be made
of an affair that happened at this particular 'job'.The windows were all fitted with venetian blinds.The gentleman for
whom all the work was being done had only just purchased the house, but
he preferred roller blinds: he had had roller blinds in his former
residence--which he had just sold--and as these roller blinds were
about the right size, he decided to have them fitted to the windows of
his new house: so he instructed Mr Rushton to have all the venetian
blinds taken down and stored away up in the loft under the roof.Mr
Rushton promised to have this done; but they were not ALL put away
under the roof: he had four of them taken to his own place and fitted
up in the conservatory.They were a little too large, so they had to
be narrowed before they were fixed.The sequel was rather interesting, for it happened that when the
gentleman attempted to take the roller blinds from his old house, the
person to whom he had sold it refused to allow them to be removed;
claiming that when he bought the house, he bought the blinds also.There was a little dispute, but eventually it was settled that way and
the gentleman decided that he would have the venetian blinds in his new
house after all, and instructed the people who moved his furniture to
take the venetians down again from under the roof, and refix them, and
then, of course, it was discovered that four of the blinds were
missing.Mr Rushton was sent for, and he said that he couldn't
understand it at all!The only possible explanation that he could
think of was that some of his workmen must have stolen them!He would
make inquiries, and endeavour to discover the culprits, but in any
case, as this had happened while things were in his charge, if he did
not succeed in recovering them, he would replace them.As the blinds had been narrowed to fit the conservatory he had to have
four new ones made.The customer was of course quite satisfied, although very sorry for Mr
Rushton.Rushton told the gentleman
that he would be astonished if he knew all the facts: the difficulties
one has to contend with in dealing with working men: one has to watch
them continually!directly one's back is turned they leave off working!They come late in the morning, and go home before the proper time at
night, and then unless one actually happens to catch them--they charge
the full number of hours on their time sheets!Every now and then
something would be missing, and of course Nobody knew anything about
it.Sometimes one would go unexpectedly to a 'job' and find a lot of
them drunk.Of course one tried to cope with these evils by means of
rules and restrictions and organization, but it was very difficult--one
could not be everywhere or have eyes at the back of one's head.The
gentleman said that he had some idea of what it was like: he had had
something to do with the lower orders himself at one time and another,
and he knew they needed a lot of watching.Rushton felt rather sick over this affair, but he consoled himself by
reflecting that he had got clear away with several valuable rose trees
and other plants which he had stolen out of the garden, and that a
ladder which had been discovered in the hayloft over the stable and
taken--by his instructions--to the 'yard' when the 'job' was finished
had not been missed.Another circumstance which helped to compensate for the blinds was that
the brass fittings throughout the house, finger-plates, sash-lifts and
locks, bolts and door handles, which were supposed to be all new and
which the customer had paid a good price for--were really all the old
ones which Misery had had re-lacquered and refixed.There was nothing unusual about this affair of the blinds, for Rushton
and Misery robbed everybody.They made a practice of annexing every
thing they could lay their hands upon, provided it could be done
without danger to themselves.They never did anything of a heroic or
dare-devil character: they had not the courage to break into banks or
jewellers' shops in the middle of the night, or to go out picking
pockets: all their robberies were of the sneak-thief order.At one house that they 'did up' Misery made a big haul.He had to get
up into the loft under the roof to see what was the matter with the
water tank.When he got up there he found a very fine hall gas lamp
made of wrought brass and copper with stained and painted glass sides.Although covered with dust, it was otherwise in perfect condition, so
Misery had it taken to his own house and cleaned up and fixed in the
hall.In the same loft there were a lot of old brass picture rods and other
fittings, and three very good planks, each about ten feet in length;
these latter had been placed across the rafters so that one could walk
easily and safely over to the tank.But Misery thought they would be
very useful to the firm for whitewashing ceilings and other work, so he
had them taken to the yard along with the old brass, which was worth
about fourpence a pound.There was another house that had to be painted inside: the people who
used to live there had only just left: they had moved to some other
town, and the house had been re-let before they vacated it.The new
tenant had agreed with the agent that the house was to be renovated
throughout before he took possession.The day after the old tenants moved away, the agent gave Rushton the
key so that he could go to see what was to be done and give an estimate
for the work.While Rushton and Misery were looking over the house they discovered a
large barometer hanging on the wall behind the front door: it had been
overlooked by those who removed the furniture.Before returning the
key to the agent, Rushton sent one of his men to the house for the
barometer, which he kept in his office for a few weeks to see if there
would be any inquiries about it.If there had been, it would have been
easy to say that he had brought it there for safety--to take care of
till he could find the owner.The people to whom it belonged thought
the thing had been lost or stolen in transit, and afterwards one of the
workmen who had assisted to pack and remove the furniture was dismissed
from his employment on suspicion of having had something to do with its
disappearance.No one ever thought of Rushton in connection with the
matter, so after about a month he had it taken to his own dwelling and
hung up in the hall near the carved oak marble-topped console table
that he had sneaked last summer from 596 Grand Parade.And there it hangs unto this day: and close behind it, supported by
cords of crimson silk, is a beautiful bevelled-edged card about a foot
square, and upon this card is written, in letters of gold: 'Christ is
the head of this house; the unseen Guest at every meal, the silent
Listener to every conversation.'And on the other side of the barometer is another card of the same kind
and size which says: 'As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.'From another place they stole two large brass chandeliers.This house
had been empty for a very long time, and its owner--who did not reside
in the town--wished to sell it.The agent, to improve the chances of a
sale, decided to have the house overhauled and redecorated.'s tender being the lowest, they got the work.The chandeliers in
the drawing-room and the dining-room were of massive brass, but they
were all blackened and tarnished.Misery suggested to the agent that
they could be cleaned and relacquered, which would make them equal to
new: in fact, they would be better than new ones, for such things as
these were not made now, and for once Misery was telling the truth.The agent agreed and the work was done: it was an extra, of course, and
as the firm got twice as much for the job as they paid for having it
done, they were almost satisfied.When this and all the other work was finished they sent in their
account and were paid.Some months afterwards the house was sold, and Nimrod interviewed the
new proprietor with the object of securing the order for any work that
he might want done.The papers on the walls of
several of the rooms were not to the new owner's taste, and, of course,
the woodwork would have to be re-painted to harmonize with the new
paper.There was a lot of other work besides this: a new conservatory
to build, a more modern bath and heating apparatus to be put in, and
the electric light to be installed, the new people having an objection
to the use of gas.The specifications were prepared by an architect, and Rushton secured
the work.When the chandeliers were taken down, the men, instructed by
Misery, put them on a handcart, and covered them over with sacks and
dust-sheets and took them to the front shop, where they were placed for
sale with the other stock.When all the work at the house was finished, it occurred to Rushton and
Nimrod that when the architect came to examine and pass the work before
giving them the certificate that would enable them to present their
account, he might remember the chandeliers and inquire what had become
of them.So they were again placed on the handcart, covered with sacks
and dust-sheets, taken back to the house and put up in the loft under
the roof so that, if he asked for them, there they were.The architect came, looked ever the house, passed the work, and gave
his certificate; he never mentioned or thought of the chandeliers.The
owner of the house was present and asked for Rushton's bill, for which
he at once gave them a cheque and Rushton and Misery almost grovelled
and wallowed on the ground before him.Throughout the whole interview
the architect and the 'gentleman' had kept their hats on, but Rushton
and Nimrod had been respectfully uncovered all the time, and as they
followed the other two about the house their bearing had been
expressive of the most abject servility.When the architect and the owner were gone the two chandeliers were
taken down again from under the roof, and put upon a handcart, covered
over with sacks and dust-sheets and taken back to the shop and again
placed for sale with the other stock.These are only a few of the petty thefts committed by these people.To
give anything approaching a full account of all the rest would require
a separate volume.As a result of all the hurrying and scamping, every now and again the
men found that they had worked themselves out of a job.Several times during the summer the firm had scarcely anything to do,
and nearly everybody had to stand off for a few days or weeks.When Newman got his first start in the early part of the year he had
only been working for about a fortnight when--with several others--he
was'stood off'.Fortunately, however, the day after he left Rushtons,
he was lucky enough to get a start for another firm, Driver and
Botchit, where he worked for nearly a month, and then he was again
given a job at Rushton's, who happened to be busy again.He did not have to lose much time, for he 'finished up' for Driver and
Botchit on a Thursday night and on the Friday he interviewed Misery,
who told him they were about to commence a fresh 'job' on the following
Monday morning at six o'clock, and that he could start with them.So
this time Newman was only out of work the Friday and Saturday, which
was another stroke of luck, because it often happens that a man has to
lose a week or more after 'finishing up' for one firm before he gets
another 'job'.All through the summer Crass continued to be the general 'colour-man',
most of his time being spent at the shop mixing up colours for all the
different 'jobs'.He also acted as a sort of lieutenant to Hunter,
who, as the reader has already been informed, was not a practical
painter.When there was a price to be given for some painting work,
Misery sometimes took Crass with him to look over it and help him to
estimate the amount of time and material it would take.Crass was thus
in a position of more than ordinary importance, not only being superior
to the 'hands', but also ranking above the other sub-foremen who had
charge of the 'jobs'.It was Crass and these sub-foremen who were to blame for most of the
scamping and driving, because if it had not been for them neither
Rushton nor Hunter would have known how to scheme the work.Of course, Hunter and Rushton wanted to drive and scamp, but not being
practical men they would not have known how if it had not been for
Crass and the others, who put them up to all the tricks of the trade.Crass knew that when the men stayed till half past seven they were in
the habit of ceasing work for a few minutes to eat a mouthful of grub
about six o'clock, so he suggested to Misery that as it was not
possible to stop this, it would be a good plan to make the men stop
work altogether from half past five till six, and lose half an hour's
pay; and to make up the time, instead of leaving off at seven-thirty,
they could work till eight.Misery had known of and winked at the former practice, for he knew that
the men could not work all that time without something to eat, but
Crass's suggestion seemed a much better way, and it was adopted.When the other masters in Mugsborough heard of this great reform they
all followed suit, and it became the rule in that town, whenever it was
necessary to work overtime, for the men to stay till eight instead of
half past seven as formerly, and they got no more pay than before.Previous to this summer it had been the almost invariable rule to have
two men in each room that was being painted, but Crass pointed out to
Misery that under such circumstances they wasted time talking to each
other, and they also acted as a check on one another: each of them
regulated the amount of work he did by the amount the other did, and if
the 'job' took too long it was always difficult to decide which of the
two was to blame: but if they were made to work alone, each of them
would be on his mettle; he would not know how much the others were
doing, and the fear of being considered slow in comparison with others
would make them all tear into it all they could.Misery thought this a very good idea, so the solitary system was
introduced, and as far as practicable, one room, one man became the
rule.They even tried to make the men distemper large ceilings single-handed,
and succeeded in one or two cases, but after several ceilings had been
spoilt and had to be washed off and done over again, they gave that up:
but nearly all the other work was now arranged on the'solitary
system', and it worked splendidly: each man was constantly in a state
of panic as to whether the others were doing more work than himself.Another suggestion that Crass made to Misery was that the sub-foremen
should be instructed never to send a man into a room to prepare it for
painting.'If you sends a man into a room to get it ready,' said Crass, ''e makes
a meal of it!'E spends as much time messin' about rubbin' down and
stoppin' up as it would take to paint it.But,' he added, with a
cunning leer, 'give 'em a bit of putty and a little bit of glass-paper,
and the paint at the stand, and then 'e gits it in 'is mind as 'e's
going in there to paint it!And 'e doesn't mess about much over the
preparing of it'.These and many other suggestions--all sorts of devices for scamping and
getting over the work--were schemed out by Crass and the other
sub-foremen, who put them into practice and showed them to Misery and
Rushton in the hope of currying favour with them and being 'kept on'.And between the lot of them they made life a veritable hell for
themselves, and the hands, and everybody else around them.And the
mainspring of it all was--the greed and selfishness of one man, who
desired to accumulate money!For this was the only object of all the
driving and bullying and hatred and cursing and unhappiness--to make
money for Rushton, who evidently considered himself a deserving case.It is sad and discreditable, but nevertheless true, that some of the
more selfish of the philanthropists often became weary of well-doing,
and lost all enthusiasm in the good cause.At such times they used to
say that they were 'Bloody well fed up' with the whole business and
'Tired of tearing their bloody guts out for the benefit of other
people' and every now and then some of these fellows would 'chuck up'
work, and go on the booze, sometimes stopping away for two or three
days or a week at a time.And then, when it was all over, they came
back, very penitent, to ask for another'start', but they generally
found that their places had been filled.If they happened to be good'sloggers'--men who made a practice of
'tearing their guts out' when they did work--they were usually
forgiven, and after being admonished by Misery, permitted to resume
work, with the understanding that if ever it occurred again they would
get the 'infernal'--which means the final and irrevocable--sack.There was once a job at a shop that had been a high-class restaurant
kept by a renowned Italian chef.It had been known as

                    'MACARONI'S ROYAL ITALIAN CAFE'

Situated on the Grand Parade, it was a favourite resort of the 'Elite',
who frequented it for afternoon tea and coffee and for little suppers
after the theatre.It had plate-glass windows, resplendent with gilding, marble-topped
tables with snow white covers, vases of flowers, and all the other
appurtenances of glittering cut glass and silver.The obsequious
waiters were in evening dress, the walls were covered with lofty
plate-glass mirrors in carved and gilded frames, and at certain hours
of the day and night an orchestra consisting of two violins and a harp
discoursed selections of classic music.But of late years the business had not been paying, and finally the
proprietor went bankrupt and was sold out.The place was shut up for
several months before the shop was let to a firm of dealers in fancy
articles, and the other part was transformed into flats.When the men went there to 'do
it up' they found the interior of the house in a state of indescribable
filth: the ceilings discoloured with smoke and hung with cobwebs, the
wallpapers smeared and black with grease, the handrails and the newel
posts of the staircase were clammy with filth, and the edges of the
doors near the handles were blackened with greasy dirt and
finger-marks.The tops of the skirtings, the mouldings of the doors,
the sashes of the windows and the corners of the floors were thick with
the accumulated dust of years.In one of the upper rooms which had evidently been used as a nursery or
playroom for the children of the renowned chef, the wallpaper for about
two feet above the skirting was blackened with grease and ornamented
with childish drawings made with burnt sticks and blacklead pencils,
the door being covered with similar artistic efforts, to say nothing of
some rude attempts at carving, evidently executed with an axe or a
hammer.But all this filth was nothing compared with the unspeakable
condition of the kitchen and scullery, a detailed description of which
would cause the blood of the reader to curdle, and each particular hair
of his head to stand on end.Let it suffice to say that the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the
paintwork, the gas-stove, the kitchen range, the dresser and everything
else were uniformly absolutely and literally--black.And the black was
composed of soot and grease.In front of the window there was a fixture--a kind of bench or table,
deeply scored with marks of knives like a butcher's block.The sill of
the window was about six inches lower than the top of the table, so
that between the glass of the lower sash of the window, which had
evidently never been raised, and the back of the table, there was a
long narrow cavity or trough, about six inches deep, four inches wide
and as long as the width of the window, the sill forming the bottom of
the cavity.This trough was filled with all manner of abominations: fragments of
fat and decomposed meat, legs of rabbits and fowls, vegetable matter,
broken knives and forks, and hair: and the glass of the window was
caked with filth of the same description.This job was the cause of the sacking of the Semi-drunk and another man
named Bill Bates, who were sent into the kitchen to clean it down and
prepare it for painting and distempering.They commenced to do it, but it made them feel so ill that they went
out and had a pint each, and after that they made another start at it.But it was not long before they felt that it was imperatively necessary
to have another drink.So they went over to the pub, and this time
they had two pints each.Bill paid for the first two and then the
Semi-drunk refused to return to work unless Bill would consent to have
another pint with him before going back.When they had drunk the two
pints, they decided--in order to save themselves the trouble and risk
of coming away from the job--to take a couple of quarts back with them
in two bottles, which the landlord of the pub lent them, charging
twopence on each bottle, to be refunded when they were returned.When they got back to the job they found the 'coddy' in the kitchen,
looking for them and he began to talk and grumble, but the Semi-drunk
soon shut him up: he told him he could either have a drink out of one
of the bottles or a punch in the bloody nose--whichever he liked!Or
if he did not fancy either of these alternatives, he could go to hell!As the 'coddy' was a sensible man he took the beer and advised them to
pull themselves together and try to get some work done before Misery
came, which they promised to do.When the 'coddy' was gone they made another attempt at the work.Misery
came a little while afterwards and began shouting at them because he
said he could not see what they had done.It looked as if they had
been asleep all the morning: Here it was nearly ten o'clock, and as far
as he could see, they had done Nothing!When he was gone they drank the rest of the beer and then they began to
feel inclined to laugh.What did they care for Hunter or Rushton
either?They left off scraping and
scrubbing, and began throwing buckets of water over the dresser and the
walls, laughing uproariously all the time.'We'll show the b--s how to wash down paintwork!'shouted the
Semi-drunk, as he stood in the middle of the room and hurled a pailful
of water over the door of the cupboard.'Bring us another bucket of
water, Bill.'Bill was out in the scullery filling his pail under the tap, and
laughing so much that he could scarcely stand.As soon as it was full
he passed it to the Semi-drunk, who threw it bodily, pail and all, on
to the bench in front of the window, smashing one of the panes of
glass.The water poured off the table and all over the floor.Bill brought the next pailful in and threw it at the kitchen door,
splitting one of the panels from top to bottom, and then they threw
about half a dozen more pailfuls over the dresser.'We'll show the b--rs how to clean paintwork,' they shouted, as they
hurled the buckets at the walls and doors.By this time the floor was deluged with water, which mingled with the
filth and formed a sea of mud.They left the two taps running in the scullery and as the waste pipe of
the sink was choked up with dirt, the sink filled up and overflowed
like a miniature Niagara.The water ran out under the doors into the back-yard, and along the
passage out to the front door.But Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
remained in the kitchen, smashing the pails at the walls and doors and
the dresser, and cursing and laughing hysterically.They had just filled the two buckets and were bringing them into the
kitchen when they heard Hunter's voice in the passage, shouting out
inquiries as to where all that water came from.Then they heard him
advancing towards them and they stood waiting for him with the pails in
their hands, and directly he opened the door and put his head into the
room they let fly the two pails at him.Unfortunately, they were too
drunk and excited to aim straight.One pail struck the middle rail of
the door and the other the wall by the side of it.Misery hastily shut the door again and ran upstairs, and presently the
'coddy' came down and called out to them from the passage.They went out to see what he wanted, and he told them that Misery had
gone to the office to get their wages ready: they were to make out
their time sheets and go for their money at once.Misery had said that
if they were not there in ten minutes he would have the pair of them
locked up.The Semi-drunk said that nothing would suit them better than to have
all their pieces at once--they had spent all their money and wanted
another drink.Bill Bates concurred, so they borrowed a piece of
blacklead pencil from the 'coddy' and made out their time sheets, took
off their aprons, put them into their tool bags, and went to the office
for their money, which Misery passed out to them through the trap-door.The news of this exploit spread all over the town during that day and
evening, and although it was in July, the next morning at six o'clock
there were half a dozen men waiting at the yard to ask Misery if there
was 'any chance of a job'.Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk had had their spree and had got the sack
for it and most of the chaps said it served them right.Such conduct
as that was going too far.Most of them would have said the same thing no matter what the
circumstances might have been.They had very little sympathy for each
other at any time.Often, when, for instance, one man was sent away from one 'job' to
another, the others would go into his room and look at the work he had
been doing, and pick out all the faults they could find and show them
to each other, making all sorts of ill-natured remarks about the absent
one meanwhile.'Jist run yer nose over that door, Jim,' one would say
in a tone of disgust.Did yer ever see sich a
mess in yer life?And the other man would
shake his head sadly and say that although the one who had done it had
never been up to much as a workman, he could do it a bit better than
that if he liked, but the fact was that he never gave himself time to
do anything properly: he was always tearing his bloody guts out!Why,
he'd only been in this room about four hours from start to finish!He
ought to have a watering cart to follow him about, because he worked at
such a hell of a rate you couldn't see him for dust!And then the
first man would reply that other people could do as they liked, but for
his part, HE was not going to tear his guts out for nobody!The second man would applaud these sentiments and say that he wasn't
going to tear his out either: and then they would both go back to their
respective rooms and tear into the work for all they were worth, making
the same sort of 'job' as the one they had been criticizing, and
afterwards, when the other's back was turned, each of them in turn
would sneak into the other's room and criticize it and point out the
faults to anyone else who happened to be near at hand.Harlow was working at the place that had been Macaroni's Cafe when one
day a note was sent to him from Hunter at the shop.It was written on
a scrap of wallpaper, and worded in the usual manner of such notes--as
if the writer had studied how to avoid all suspicion of being unduly
civil:

    Harlow go to the yard at once take your tools with you.Crass will tell you where you have to go.They were just finishing their dinners when the boy brought this note;
and after reading it aloud for the benefit of the others, Harlow
remarked that it was worded in much the same way in which one would
speak to a dog.The others said nothing; but after he was gone the
other men--who all considered that it was ridiculous for the 'likes of
us' to expect or wish to be treated with common civility--laughed about
it, and said that Harlow was beginning to think he was Somebody: they
supposed it was through readin' all those books what Owen was always
lendin' 'im.And then one of them got a piece of paper and wrote a
note to be given to Harlow at the first opportunity.This note was
properly worded, written in a manner suitable for a gentleman like him,
neatly folded and addressed:


    Mr Harlow Esq.,
      c/o Macaroni's Royal Cafe
        till called for.Mister Harlow,
      Dear Sir: Wood you kinely oblige me bi cummin to the paint shop
    as soon as you can make it convenient as there is a sealin' to be
    wite-woshed hoppin this is not trubbling you to much

                                                  I remane
                                                  Yours respeckfully
                                                       Pontius Pilate.This note was read out for the amusement of the company and afterwards
stored away in the writer's pocket till such a time as an opportunity
should occur of giving it to Harlow.As the writer of the note was on his way back to his room to resume
work he was accosted by a man who had gone into Harlow's room to
criticize it, and had succeeded in finding several faults which he
pointed out to the other, and of course they were both very much
disgusted with Harlow.'I can't think why the coddy keeps him on the job,' said the first man.'Between you and me, if I had charge of a job, and Misery sent Harlow
there--I'd send 'im back to the shop.''Same as you,' agreed the other as he went back to tear into his own
room.'Same as you, old man: I shouldn't 'ave 'im neither.'It must not be supposed from this that either of these two men were on
exceptionally bad terms with Harlow; they were just as good friends
with him--to his face--as they were with each other--to each other's
faces--and it was just their way: that was all.If it had been one or both of these two who had gone away instead of
Harlow, just the same things would have been said about them by the
others who remained--it was merely their usual way of speaking about
each other behind each other's backs.It was always the same: if any one of them made a mistake or had an
accident or got into any trouble he seldom or never got any sympathy
from his fellow workmen.On the contrary, most of them at such times
seemed rather pleased than otherwise.There was a poor devil--a stranger in the town; he came from
London--who got the sack for breaking some glass.He had been sent to
'burn off' some old paint of the woodwork of a window.He was not very
skilful in the use of the burning-off lamp, because on the firm when he
had been working in London it was a job that the ordinary hands were
seldom or never called upon to do.There were one or two men who did
it all.For that matter, not many of Rushton's men were very skilful
at it either.It was a job everybody tried to get out of, because
nearly always the lamp went wrong and there was a row about the time
the work took.So they worked this job on to the stranger.This man had been out of work for a long time before he got a start at
Rushton's, and he was very anxious not to lose the job, because he had
a wife and family in London.When the 'coddy' told him to go and burn
off this window he did not like to say that he was not used to the
work: he hoped to be able to do it.But he was very nervous, and the
end was that although he managed to do the burning off all right, just
as he was finishing he accidentally allowed the flame of the lamp to
come into contact with a large pane of glass and broke it.They sent to the shop for a new pane of glass, and the man stayed late
that night and put it in in his own time, thus bearing half the cost of
repairing it.Things were not very busy just then, and on the following Saturday two
of the hands were'stood off'.The stranger was one of them, and
nearly everybody was very pleased.At mealtimes the story of the
broken window was repeatedly told amid jeering laughter.It really
seemed as if a certain amount of indignation was felt that a
stranger--especially such an inferior person as this chap who did not
know how to use a lamp--should have had the cheek to try to earn his
living at all!One thing was very certain--they said, gleefully--he
would never get another job at Rushton's: that was one good thing.And yet they all knew that this accident might have happened to any one
of them.Once a couple of men got the sack because a ceiling they distempered
had to be washed off and done again.It was not really the men's fault
at all: it was a ceiling that needed special treatment and they had not
been allowed to do it properly.But all the same, when they got the sack most of the others laughed and
sneered and were glad.Perhaps because they thought that the fact that
these two unfortunates had been disgraced, increased their own chances
of being 'kept on'.With a few
exceptions, they had an immense amount of respect for Rushton and
Hunter, and very little respect or sympathy for each other.Exactly the same lack of feeling for each other prevailed amongst the
members of all the different trades.Everybody seemed glad if anybody
got into trouble for any reason whatever.There was a garden gate that had been made at the carpenter's shop: it
was not very well put together, and for the usual reason; the man had
not been allowed the time to do it properly.After it was fixed, one
of his shopmates wrote upon it with lead pencil in big letters: 'This
is good work for a joiner.But to hear them talking in the pub of a Saturday afternoon just after
pay-time one would think them the best friends and mates and the most
independent spirits in the world, fellows whom it would be very
dangerous to trifle with, and who would stick up for each other through
thick and thin.All sorts of stories were related of the wonderful
things they had done and said; of jobs they had 'chucked up', and
masters they had 'told off': of pails of whitewash thrown over
offending employers, and of horrible assaults and batteries committed
upon the same.But strange to say, for some reason or other, it seldom
happened that a third party ever witnessed any of these prodigies.It
seemed as if a chivalrous desire to spare the feelings of their victims
had always prevented them from doing or saying anything to them in the
presence of witnesses.When he had drunk a few pints, Crass was a very good hand at these
stories.Here is one that he told in the bar of the Cricketers on the
Saturday afternoon of the same week that Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
got the sack.The Cricketers was only a few minutes walk from the shop
and at pay-time a number of the men used to go in there to take a drink
before going home.'Last Thursday night about five o'clock, 'Unter comes inter the
paint-shop an' ses to me, "I wants a pail o' wash made up tonight,
Crass," 'e ses, "ready for fust thing in the mornin'," 'e ses."Oh," I
ses, lookin' 'im straight in the bloody eye, "Oh, yer do, do
yer?""Well, you can bloody well make
it yerself!"I ses, "'cos I ain't agoin' to," I ses--just like that."Wot the 'ell do yer mean," I ses, "by comin' 'ere at this time o'
night with a order like that?"You'd a larfed,' continued
Crass, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand after taking
another drink out of his glass, and looking round to note the effect of
the story, 'you'd a larfed if you'd bin there.'E was fairly
flabbergasted!And wen I said that to 'im I see 'is jaw drop!An'
then 'e started apoligizing and said as 'e 'adn't meant no offence, but
I told 'im bloody straight not to come no more of it."You bring the
horder at a reasonable time," I ses--just like that--"and I'll attend
to it," I ses, "but not otherwise," I ses.'As he concluded this story, Crass drained his glass and gazed round
upon the audience, who were full of admiration.They looked at each
other and at Crass and nodded their heads approvingly.Yes,
undoubtedly, that was the proper way to deal with such bounders as
Nimrod; take up a strong attitude, an' let 'em see as you'll stand no
nonsense!'Yer don't blame me, do yer?''Why should we put up
with a lot of old buck from the likes of 'im!We're not a lot of
bloody Chinamen, are we?'So far from blaming him, they all assured him that they would have
acted in precisely the same way under similar circumstances.'For my part, I'm a bloke like this,' said a tall man with a very loud
voice--a chap who nearly fell down dead every time Rushton or Misery
looked at him.'I'm a bloke like this 'ere: I never stands no cheek
from no gaffers!If a guv'nor ses two bloody words to me, I downs me
tools and I ses to 'im, "Wot!Don't I suit yer, guv'ner?Ain't I done
enuff for yer?Gimmie me bleedin' a'pence."'If
only everyone would do the same as the tall man--who had just paid for
another round of drinks--things would be a lot more comfortable than
they was.'Last summer I was workin' for ole Buncer,' said a little man with a
cutaway coat several sizes too large for him.'I was workin' for ole
Buncer, over at Windley, an' you all knows as 'e don't arf lower it.Well, one day, when I knowed 'e was on the drunk, I 'ad to first coat a
room out--white; so thinks I to meself, "If I buck up I shall be able
to get this lot done by about four o'clock, an' then I can clear orf
'ome.'Cos I reckoned as 'e'd be about flattened out by that time, an'
you know 'e ain't got no foreman.So I tears into it an' gets this
'ere room done about a quarter past four, an' I'd just got me things
put away for the night w'en 'oo should come fallin' up the bloody
stairs but ole Buncer, drunk as a howl!An' no sooner 'e gits inter
the room than 'e starts yappin' an' rampin'.""Is this 'ere hall
you've done?""Wotcher bin up to hall day?"'e ses, an'
'e keeps on shouting' an' swearin' till at last I couldn't stand it no
longer, 'cos you can guess I wasn't in a very good temper with 'im
comin' along jist then w'en I thought I was goin' to get orf a bit
early--so w'en 'e kept on shoutin' I never made no answer to 'im, but
ups with me fist an' I gives 'im a slosh in the dial an' stopped 'is
clock!Then I chucked the pot o' w'ite paint hover 'im, an' kicked 'im
down the bloody stairs.''Serve 'im blooming well right, too,' said Crass as he took a fresh
glass of beer from one of the others, who had just'stood' another
round.'What did the b--r say to that?'replied the little man, ''E picked 'isself up, and
called a keb wot was passin' an' got inter it an' went 'ome; an' I
never seen no more of 'im until about 'arf-past eleven the next day,
w'en I was second-coatin' the room, an' 'e comes up with a noo suit o'
clothes on, an' arsts me if I'd like to come hover to the pub an' 'ave
a drink?So we goes hover, an' 'e calls for a w'iskey an' soda for
isself an' arsts me wot I'd 'ave, so I 'ad the same.An' w'ile we was
gettin' it down us, 'e ses to me, "Ah, Garge," 'e ses."You losed your
temper with me yesterday,"' 'e ses.'If you 'adn't served 'im as you did you'd most likely 'ave 'ad to
put up with a lot more ole buck.'They all agreed that the little man had done quite right: they all said
that they didn' blame him in the least: they would all have done the
same: in fact, this was the way they all conducted themselves whenever
occasion demanded it.To hear them talk, one would imagine that such
affairs as the recent exploit of Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk were
constantly taking place, instead of only occurring about once in a blue
moon.Crass stood the final round of drinks, and as he evidently thought that
circumstance deserved to be signalized in some special manner, he
proposed the following toast, which was drunk with enthusiasm:

        'To hell with the man,
        May he never grow fat,
        What carries two faces,
        Under one 'at.'They did not have many
big jobs, but there were a lot of little ones, and the boy Bert was
kept busy running from one to the other.He spent most of his time
dragging a handcart with loads of paint, or planks and steps, and
seldom went out to work with the men, for when he was not taking things
out to the various places where the philanthropists were working, he
was in the paintshop at the yard, scraping out dirty paint-pots or
helping Crass to mix up colours.Although scarcely anyone seemed to
notice it, the boy presented a truly pitiable spectacle.Dragging the handcart did not help him to put on flesh,
for the weather was very hot and the work made him sweat.His home was right away on the other side of Windley.It took him more
than three-quarters of an hour to walk to the shop, and as he had to be
at work at six, that meant that he had to leave home at a few minutes
past five every morning, so that he always got up about half past four.He was wearing a man's coat--or rather jacket--which gave the upper
part of his body a bulky appearance.The trousers were part of a suit
of his own, and were somewhat narrowly cut, as is the rule with boys'
cheap ready-made trousers.These thin legs appearing under the big
jacket gave him a rather grotesque appearance, which was heightened by
the fact that all his clothes, cap, coat, waistcoat, trousers and
boots, were smothered with paint and distemper of various colours, and
there were generally a few streaks of paint of some sort or other upon
his face, and of course his hands--especially round the
fingernails--were grimed with it.But the worst of all were the
dreadful hobnailed boots: the leather of the uppers of these was an
eighth of an inch thick, and very stiff.Across the fore part of the
boot this hard leather had warped into ridges and valleys, which chafed
his feet, and made them bleed.The soles were five-eighths of an inch
thick, covered with hobnails, and were as hard and inflexible and
almost as heavy as iron.These boots hurt his feet dreadfully and made
him feel very tired and miserable, for he had such a lot of walking to
do.He used to be jolly glad when dinner-time came, for then he used to
get out of sight in some quiet spot and lie down for the whole hour.His favourite dining-place was up in the loft over the carpenter's
shop, where they stored the mouldings and architraves.No one ever
came there at that hour, and after he had eaten his dinner he used to
lie down and think and rest.He nearly always had an hour for dinner, but he did not always have it
at the same time: sometimes he had it at twelve o'clock and sometimes
not till two.It all depended upon what stuff had to be taken to the
job.Often it happened that some men at a distant job required some material
to use immediately after dinner, and perhaps Crass was not able to get
it ready till twelve o'clock, so that it was not possible to take it
before dinner-time, and if Bert left it till after dinner the men would
be wasting their time waiting for it: so in such cases he took it there
first and had his dinner when he came back.Sometimes he got back about half past twelve, and it was necessary for
him to take out another lot of material at one o'clock.In such a case he 'charged' half an hour overtime on his time sheet--he
used to get twopence an hour for overtime.Sometimes Crass sent him with a handcart to one job to get a pair of
steps or tressels, or a plank, or some material or other, and take them
to another job, and on these occasions it was often very late before he
was able to take his meals.Instead of getting his breakfast at eight,
it was often nearly nine before he got back to the shop, and frequently
he had to go without dinner until half past one or two.Sometimes he could scarcely manage to carry the pots of paint to the
jobs; his feet were so hot and sore.When he had to push the cart it
was worse still, and often when knocking-off time came he felt so tired
that he could scarcely manage to walk home.But the weather was not always hot or fine: sometimes it was quite
cold, almost like winter, and there was a lot of rain that summer.At
such times the boy frequently got wet through several times a day as he
went from one job to another, and he had to work all the time in his
wet clothes and boots, which were usually old and out of repair and let
in the water.One of the worst jobs that he had to do was when a new stock of white
lead came in.This stuff came in wooden barrels containing two
hundredweight, and he used to have to dig it out of these barrels with
a trowel, and put it into a metal tank, where it was kept covered with
water, and the empty barrels were returned to the makers.When he was doing this work he usually managed to get himself smeared
all over with the white lead, and this circumstance, and the fact that
he was always handling paint or some poisonous material or other was
doubtless the cause of the terrible pains he often had in his
stomach--pains that sometimes caused him to throw himself down and roll
on the ground in agony.One afternoon Crass sent him with a handcart to a job that Easton,
Philpot, Harlow and Owen were just finishing.He got there about half
past four and helped the men to load up the things, and afterwards
walked alongside the cart with them back to the shop.On the way they all noticed and remarked to each other that the boy
looked tired and pale and that he seemed to limp: but he did not say
anything, although he guessed that they were talking about him.They
arrived at the shop a little before knocking-off time--about ten
minutes past five.Bert helped them to unload, and afterwards, while
they were putting their things away and 'charging up' the unused
materials they had brought back, he pushed the cart over to the shed
where it was kept, on the other side of the yard.He did not return to
the shop at once and a few minutes later when Harlow came out into the
yard to get a bucket of water to wash their hands with, he saw the boy
leaning on the side of the cart, crying, and holding one foot off the
ground.Harlow asked him what was the matter, and while he was speaking to him
the others came out to see what was up: the boy said he had rheumatism
or growing pains or something in his leg, 'just here near the knee'.But he didn't say much, he just cried miserably, and turned his head
slowly from side to side, avoiding the looks of the men because he felt
ashamed that they should see him cry.When they saw how ill and miserable he looked, the men all put their
hands in their pockets to get some coppers to give to him so that he
could ride home on the tram.They gave him fivepence altogether, more
than enough to ride all the way; and Crass told him to go at
once--there was no need to wait till half past; but before he went
Philpot got a small glass bottle out of his tool bag and filled it with
oil and turps--two of turps and one of oil--which he gave to Bert to
rub into his leg before going to bed: The turps--he explained--was to
cure the pain and the oil was to prevent it from hurting the skin.He
was to get his mother to rub it in for him if he were too tired to do
it himself.Bert promised to observe these directions, and, drying his
tears, took his dinner basket and limped off to catch the tram.It was a few days after this that Hunter met with an accident.He was
tearing off on his bicycle to one of the jobs about five minutes to
twelve to see if he could catch anyone leaving off for dinner before
the proper time, and while going down a rather steep hill the
front brake broke--the rubbers of the rear one were worn out and failed
to act--so Misery to save himself from being smashed against the
railings of the houses at the bottom of the hill, threw himself off the
machine, with the result that his head and face and hands were terribly
cut and bruised.He was so badly knocked about that he had to remain
at home for nearly three weeks, much to the delight of the men and the
annoyance--one might even say the indignation--of Mr Rushton, who did
not know enough about the work to make out estimates without
assistance.There were several large jobs to be tendered for at the
same time, so Rushton sent the specifications round to Hunter's house
for him to figure out the prices, and nearly all the time that Misery
was at home he was sitting up in bed, swathed in bandages, trying to
calculate the probable cost of these jobs.Rushton did not come to see
him, but he sent Bert nearly every day, either with some
specifications, or some accounts, or something of that sort, or with a
note inquiring when Hunter thought he would be able to return to work.All sorts of rumours became prevalent amongst the men concerning
Hunter's condition.He had 'broken his spiral column', he had
'conjunction of the brain', or he had injured his 'innards' and would
probably never be able to 'do no more slave-drivin''.Crass--who had
helped Mr Rushton to 'price up' several small jobs--began to think it
might not be altogether a bad thing for himself if something were to
happen to Hunter, and he began to put on side and to assume airs of
authority.He got one of the light-weights to assist him in his work
of colourman and made him do all the hard work, while he spent part of
his own time visiting the different jobs to see how the work progressed.He was wearing a pair of sporting
trousers the pattern of which consisted of large black and white
squares.The previous owner of these trousers was taller and slighter
than Crass, so although the legs were about a couple of inches too
long, they fitted him rather tightly, so much so that it was fortunate
that he had his present job of colourman, for if he had had to do any
climbing up and down ladders or steps, the trousers would have burst.His jacket was also two or three sizes too small, and the sleeves were
so short that the cuffs of his flanelette shirt were visible.This
coat was made of serge, and its colour had presumably once been blue,
but it was now a sort of heliotrope and violet: the greater part being
of the former tint, and the parts under the sleeves of the latter.This
jacket fitted very tightly across the shoulders and back and being much
too short left his tightly clad posteriors exposed to view.He however seemed quite unconscious of anything peculiar in his
appearance and was so bumptious and offensive that most of the men were
almost glad when Nimrod came back.They said that if Crass ever got
the job he would be a dam' sight worse than Hunter.As for the latter,
for a little while after his return to work it was said that his
illness had improved his character: he had had time to think things
over; and in short, he was ever so much better than before: but it was
not long before this story began to be told the other way round.and a thing that happened about a fortnight after
his return caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and
Rushton than had ever existed previously.What led up to it was
something that was done by Bundy's mate, Ted Dawson.This poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or
other: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big
bucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart.He must
have been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this
manner for Rushton & Co.from six in the morning till half past five at
night, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours
after tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning
before going to work.The poor devil needed the produce of his garden
to supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to
provide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid
only--fourpence an hour.There was an old house to which they were making some alterations and
repairs, and there was a lot of old wood taken out of it: old, decayed
floorboards and stuff of that kind, wood that was of no use whatever
except to burn.Bundy and his mate were working there, and one night, Misery came a few
minutes before half past five and caught Dawson in the act of tying up
a small bundle of this wood.When Hunter asked him what he was going
to do with it he made no attempt at prevarication or concealment: he
said he was going to take it home for fire-wood, because it was of no
other use.Misery kicked up a devil of a row and ordered him to leave
the wood where it was: it had to be taken to the yard, and it was
nothing to do with Dawson or anyone else whether it was any use or not!If he caught anyone taking wood away he would sack them on the spot.Hunter shouted very loud so that all the others might hear, and as they
were all listening attentively in the next room, where they were taking
their aprons off preparatory to going home, they got the full benefit
of his remarks.The following Saturday when the hands went to the office for their
money they were each presented with a printed card bearing the
following legend:

    Under no circumstances is any article or material, however
    trifling, to be taken away by workmen for their private use,
    whether waste material or not, from any workshop or place where
    work is being done.Foremen are hereby instructed to see that
    this order is obeyed and to report any such act coming to their
    knowledge.Any man breaking this rule will be either dismissed
    without notice or given into custody.Most of the men took these cards with the envelopes containing their
wages and walked away without making any comment--in fact, most of them
were some distance away before they realized exactly what the card was
about.Two or three of them stood a few steps away from the pay window
in full view of Rushton and Misery and ostentatiously tore the thing
into pieces and threw them into the street.One man remained at the
pay window while he read the card--and then flung it with an obscene
curse into Rushton's face, and demanded his back day, which they gave
him without any remark or delay, the other men who were not yet paid
having to wait while he made out his time-sheet for that morning.The story of this card spread all over the place in a very short time.It became the talk of every shop in the town.Whenever any of
Rushton's men encountered the employees of another firm, the latter
used to shout after them--'However trifling!''Ere comes some of Rushton's pickpockets.'Amongst Rushton's men themselves it became a standing joke or form of
greeting to say when one met another--'Remember!If one of their number was seen going home with an unusual amount of
paint or whitewash on his hands or clothes, the others would threaten
to report him for stealing the material.They used to say that however
trifling the quantity, it was against orders to take it away.Harlow drew up a list of rules which he said Mr Rushton had instructed
him to communicate to the men.One of these rules provided that
everybody was to be weighed upon arrival at the job in the morning and
again at leaving-off time: any man found to have increased in weight
was to be discharged.There was also much cursing and covert resentment about it; the men
used to say that such a thing as that looked well coming from the likes
of Rushton and Hunter, and they used to remind each other of the affair
of the marble-topped console table, the barometer, the venetian blinds
and all the other robberies.None of them ever said anything to either Misery or Rushton about the
cards, but one morning when the latter was reading his letters at the
breakfast table, on opening one of them he found that it contained one
of the notices, smeared with human excrement.He did not eat any more
breakfast that morning.It was not to be much wondered at that none of them had the courage to
openly resent the conditions under which they had to work, for although
it was summer, there were many men out of employment, and it was much
easier to get the sack than it was to get another job.None of the men were ever caught stealing anything, however trifling,
but all the same during the course of the summer five or six of them
were captured by the police and sent to jail--for not being able to pay
their poor rates.All through the summer Owen continued to make himself objectionable and
to incur the ridicule of his fellow workmen by talking about the causes
of poverty and of ways to abolish it.Most of the men kept two shillings or half a crown of their wages back
from their wives for pocket money, which they spent on beer and
tobacco.There were a very few who spent a little more than this, and
there were a still smaller number who spent so much in this way that
their families had to suffer in consequence.Most of those who kept back half a crown or three shillings from their
wives did so on the understanding that they were to buy their clothing
out of it.Some of them had to pay a shilling a week to a tallyman or
credit clothier.These were the ones who indulged in shoddy new
suits--at long intervals.Others bought--or got their wives to buy for
them--their clothes at second-hand shops, 'paying off' about a shilling
or so a week and not receiving the things till they were paid for.There were a very large proportion of them who did not spend even a
shilling a week for drink: and there were numerous others who, while
not being formally total abstainers, yet often went for weeks together
without either entering a public house or tasting intoxicating drink in
any form.Then there were others who, instead of drinking tea or coffee or cocoa
with their dinners or suppers, drank beer.This did not cost more than
the teetotal drinks, but all the same there are some persons who say
that those who swell the 'Nation's Drink Bill' by drinking beer with
their dinners or suppers are a kind of criminal, and that they ought to
be compelled to drink something else: that is, if they are working
people.As for the idle classes, they of course are to be allowed to
continue to make merry, 'drinking whisky, wine and sherry', to say
nothing of having their beer in by the barrel and the dozen--or forty
dozen--bottles.But of course that's a different matter, because these
people make so much money out of the labour of the working classes that
they can afford to indulge in this way without depriving their children
of the necessaries of life.There is no more cowardly, dastardly slander than is contained in the
assertion that the majority or any considerable proportion of working
men neglect their families through drink.There
are some who do, but they are not even a large minority.They are few
and far between, and are regarded with contempt by their fellow workmen.It will be said that their families had to suffer for want of even the
little that most of them spent in that way: but the persons that use
this argument should carry it to its logical conclusion.Tea is an
unnecessary and harmful drink; it has been condemned by medical men so
often that to enumerate its evil qualities here would be waste of time.The same can be said of nearly all the cheap temperance drinks; they
are unnecessary and harmful and cost money, and, like beer, are drunk
only for pleasure.What right has anyone to say to working men that when their work is
done they should not find pleasure in drinking a glass or two of beer
together in a tavern or anywhere else?Let those who would presume to
condemn them carry their argument to its logical conclusion and condemn
pleasure of every kind.Let them persuade the working classes to lead
still simpler lives; to drink water instead of such unwholesome things
as tea, coffee, beer, lemonade and all the other harmful and
unnecessary stuff.They would then be able to live ever so much more
cheaply, and as wages are always and everywhere regulated by the cost
of living, they would be able to work for lower pay.These people are fond of quoting the figures of the 'Nation's Drink
Bill,' as if all this money were spent by the working classes!But if
the amount of money spent in drink by the 'aristocracy', the clergy and
the middle classes were deducted from the 'Nation's Drink Bill', it
would be seen that the amount spent per head by the working classes is
not so alarming after all; and would probably not be much larger than
the amount spent on drink by those who consume tea and coffee and all
the other unwholesome and unnecessary 'temperance' drinks.The fact that some of Rushton's men spent about two shillings a week on
drink while they were in employment was not the cause of their poverty.If they had never spent a farthing for drink, and if their wretched
wages had been increased fifty percent, they would still have been in a
condition of the most abject and miserable poverty, for nearly all the
benefits and privileges of civilization, nearly everything that makes
life worth living, would still have been beyond their reach.It is inevitable, so long as men have to live and work under such
heartbreaking, uninteresting conditions as at present that a certain
proportion of them will seek forgetfulness and momentary happiness in
the tavern, and the only remedy for this evil is to remove the cause;
and while that is in process, there is something else that can be done
and that is, instead of allowing filthy drinking dens, presided over by
persons whose interest it is to encourage men to drink more bad beer
than is good for them or than they can afford,--to have civilized
institutions run by the State or the municipalities for use and not
merely for profit.Decent pleasure houses, where no drunkenness or
filthiness would be tolerated--where one could buy real beer or coffee
or tea or any other refreshments; where men could repair when their
day's work was over and spend an hour or two in rational intercourse
with their fellows or listen to music and singing.Taverns to which
they could take their wives and children without fear of defilement,
for a place that is not fit for the presence of a woman or a child is
not fit to exist at all.Owen, being a teetotaller, did not spend any of his money on drink; but
he spent a lot on what he called 'The Cause'.Every week he bought
some penny or twopenny pamphlets or some leaflets about Socialism,
which he lent or gave to his mates; and in this way and by means of
much talk he succeeded in converting a few to his party.Philpot,
Harlow and a few others used to listen with interest, and some of them
even paid for the pamphlets they obtained from Owen, and after reading
them themselves, passed them on to others, and also occasionally 'got
up' arguments on their own accounts.Others were simply indifferent,
or treated the subject as a kind of joke, ridiculing the suggestion
that it was possible to abolish poverty.They repeated that there had
'always been rich and poor in the world and there always would be, so
there was an end of it'.But the majority were bitterly hostile; not
to Owen, but to Socialism.For the man himself most of them had a
certain amount of liking, especially the ordinary hands because it was
known that he was not a'master's man' and that he had declined to
'take charge' of jobs which Misery had offered to him.But to
Socialism they were savagely and malignantly opposed.Some of those
who had shown some symptoms of Socialism during the past winter when
they were starving had now quite recovered and were stout defenders of
the Present System.Barrington was still working for the firm and continued to maintain his
manner of reserve, seldom speaking unless addressed but all the same,
for several reasons, it began to be rumoured that he shared Owen's
views.He always paid for the pamphlets that Owen gave him, and on one
occasion, when Owen bought a thousand leaflets to give away, Barrington
contributed a shilling towards the half-crown that Owen paid for them.But he never took any part in the arguments that sometimes raged during
the dinner-hour or at breakfast-time.It was a good thing for Owen that he had his enthusiasm for 'the cause'
to occupy his mind.Socialism was to him what drink was to some of the
others--the thing that enable them to forget and tolerate the
conditions under which they were forced to exist.Some of them were so
muddled with beer, and others so besotted with admiration of their
Liberal and Tory masters, that they were oblivious of the misery of
their own lives, and in a similar way, Owen was so much occupied in
trying to rouse them from their lethargy and so engrossed in trying to
think out new arguments to convince them of the possibility of bringing
about an improvement in their condition that he had no time to dwell
upon his own poverty; the money that he spent on leaflets and pamphlets
to give away might have been better spent on food and clothing for
himself, because most of those to whom he gave them were by no means
grateful; but he never thought of that; and after all, nearly everyone
spends money on some hobby or other.Some people deny themselves the
necessaries or comforts of life in order that they may be able to help
to fatten a publican.Others deny themselves in order to enable a lazy
parson to live in idleness and luxury; and others spend much time and
money that they really need for themselves in buying Socialist
literature to give away to people who don't want to know about
Socialism.One Sunday morning towards the end of July, a band of about twenty-five
men and women on bicycles invaded the town.Two of them--who rode a
few yards in front of the others, had affixed to the handlebars of each
of their machines a slender, upright standard from the top of one of
which fluttered a small flag of crimson silk with 'International
Brotherhood and Peace' in gold letters.The other standard was similar
in size and colour, but with a different legend: 'One for all and All
for one.'As they rode along they gave leaflets to the people in the streets, and
whenever they came to a place where there were many people they
dismounted and walked about, giving their leaflets to whoever would
accept them.They made several long halts during their progress along
the Grand Parade, where there was a considerable crowd, and then they
rode over the hill to Windley, which they reached a little before
opening time.There were little crowds waiting outside the several
public houses and a number of people passing through the streets on
their way home from Church and Chapel.The strangers distributed
leaflets to all those who would take them, and they went through a lot
of the side streets, putting leaflets under the doors and in the
letter-boxes.When they had exhausted their stock they remounted and
rode back the way they came.Meantime the news of their arrival had spread, and as they returned
through the town they were greeted with jeers and booing.Presently
someone threw a stone, and as there happened to be plenty of stones
just there several others followed suit and began running after the
retreating cyclists, throwing stones, hooting and cursing.The leaflet which had given rise to all this fury read as follows:

                            WHAT IS SOCIALISM?At present the workers, with hand and brain produce continually
    food, clothing and all useful and beautiful things in great
    abundance.BUT THEY LABOUR IN VAIN--for they are mostly poor and often in
    want.Their women and
    children suffer, and their old age is branded with pauperism.Socialism is a plan by which poverty will be abolished, and
    everyone enabled to live in plenty and comfort, with leisure and
    opportunity for ampler life.If you wish to hear more of this plan, come to the field at the
    Cross Roads on the hill at Windley, on Tuesday evening next at 8
    P.M.and

                      LOOK OUT FOR THE SOCIALIST VAN

The cyclists rode away amid showers of stones without sustaining much
damage.One had his hand cut and another, who happened to look round,
was struck on the forehead, but these were the only casualties.On the following Tuesday evening, long before the appointed time, there
was a large crowd assembled at the cross roads or the hill at Windley,
waiting for the appearance of the van, and they were evidently prepared
to give the Socialists a warm reception.There was only one policeman
in uniform there but there were several in plain clothes amongst the
crowd.Crass, Dick Wantley, the Semi-drunk, Sawkins, Bill Bates and several
other frequenters of the Cricketers were amongst the crowd, and there
were also a sprinkling of tradespeople, including the Old Dear and Mr
Smallman, the grocer, and a few ladies and gentlemen--wealthy
visitors--but the bulk of the crowd were working men, labourers,
mechanics and boys.As it was quite evident that the crowd meant mischief--many of them had
their pockets filled with stones and were armed with sticks--several of
the Socialists were in favour of going to meet the van to endeavour to
persuade those in charge from coming, and with that object they
withdrew from the crowd, which was already regarding them with menacing
looks, and went down the road in the direction from which the van was
expected to come.They had not gone very far, however, before the
people, divining what they were going to do, began to follow them and
while they were hesitating what course to pursue, the Socialist van,
escorted by five or six men on bicycles, appeared round the corner at
the bottom of the hill.As soon as the crowd saw it, they gave an exultant cheer, or, rather,
yell, and began running down the hill to meet it, and in a few minutes
it was surrounded by a howling mob.The van was drawn by two horses;
there was a door and a small platform at the back and over this was a
sign with white letters on a red ground: 'Socialism, the only hope of
the Workers.'The driver pulled up, and another man on the platform at the rear
attempted to address the crowd, but his voice was inaudible in the din
of howls, catcalls, hooting and obscene curses.After about an hour of
this, as the crowd began pushing against the van and trying to overturn
it, the terrified horses commenced to get restive and uncontrollable,
and the man on the box attempted to drive up the hill.This seemed to
still further infuriate the horde of savages who surrounded the van.Numbers of them clutched the wheels and turned them the reverse way,
screaming that it must go back to where it came from; several of them
accordingly seized the horses' heads and, amid cheers, turned them
round.The man on the platform was still trying to make himself heard, but
without success.The strangers who had come with the van and the
little group of local Socialists, who had forced their way through the
crowd and gathered together close to the platform in front of the
would-be speaker, only increased the din by their shouts of appeal to
the crowd to 'give the man a fair chance'.This little bodyguard
closed round the van as it began to move slowly downhill, but they were
not sufficiently numerous to protect it from the crowd, which, not
being satisfied with the rate at which the van was proceeding, began to
shout to each other to 'Run it away!'and several
savage rushes were made with the intention of putting these suggestions
into execution.Some of the defenders were hampered with their bicycles, but they
resisted as well as they were able, and succeeded in keeping the crowd
off until the foot of the hill was reached, and then someone threw the
first stone, which by a strange chance happened to strike one of the
cyclists whose head was already bandaged--it was the same man who had
been hit on the Sunday.This stone was soon followed by others, and
the man on the platform was the next to be struck.He got it right on
the mouth, and as he put up his handkerchief to staunch the blood
another struck him on the forehead just above the temple, and he
dropped forward on his face on to the platform as if he had been shot.As the speed of the vehicle increased, a regular hail of stones fell
upon the roof and against the sides of the van and whizzed past the
retreating cyclists, while the crowd followed close behind, cheering,
shrieking out volleys of obscene curses, and howling like wolves.'We'll give the b--rs Socialism!'shouted Crass, who was literally
foaming at the mouth.'We'll teach 'em to come 'ere trying to undermined our bloody
morality,' howled Dick Wantley as he hurled a lump of granite that he
had torn up from the macadamized road at one of the cyclists.They ran on after the van until it was out of range, and then they
bethought themselves of the local Socialists; but they were nowhere to
be seen; they had prudently withdrawn as soon as the van had got fairly
under way, and the victory being complete, the upholders of the present
system returned to the piece of waste ground on the top of the hill,
where a gentleman in a silk hat and frockcoat stood up on a little
hillock and made a speech.He said nothing about the Distress
Committee or the Soup Kitchen or the children who went to school
without proper clothes or food, and made no reference to what was to be
done next winter, when nearly everybody would be out of work.These
were matters he and they were evidently not at all interested in.But
he said a good deal about the Glorious Empire!The things he said were received with rapturous
applause, and at the conclusion of his address, the crowd sang the
National Anthem with great enthusiasm and dispersed, congratulating
themselves that they had shown to the best of their ability what
Mugsborough thought of Socialism and the general opinion of the crowd
was that they would hear nothing more from the Socialist van.But in this they were mistaken, for the very next Sunday evening a
crowd of Socialists suddenly materialized at the Cross Roads.Some of
them had come by train, others had walked from different places and
some had cycled.A crowd gathered and the Socialists held a meeting, two speeches being
delivered before the crowd recovered from their surprise at the
temerity of these other Britishers who apparently had not sense enough
to understand that they had been finally defeated and obliterated last
Tuesday evening: and when the cyclist with the bandaged head got up on
the hillock some of the crowd actually joined in the hand-clapping with
which the Socialists greeted him.In the course of his speech he informed them that the man who had come
with the van and who had been felled whilst attempting to speak from
the platform was now in hospital.For some time it had been probable
that he would not recover, but he was now out of danger, and as soon as
he was well enough there was no doubt that he would come there again.Upon this Crass shouted out that if ever the Vanners did return, they
would finish what they had begun last Tuesday.He would not get off so
easy next time.But when he said this, Crass--not being able to see
into the future--did not know what the reader will learn in due time,
that the man was to return to that place under different circumstances.When they had finished their speech-making one of the strangers who was
acting as chairman invited the audience to put questions, but as nobody
wanted to ask any, he invited anyone who disagreed with what had been
said to get up on the hillock and state his objections, so that the
audience might have an opportunity of judging for themselves which side
was right; but this invitation was also neglected.Then the chairman
announced that they were coming there again next Sunday at the same
time, when a comrade would speak on 'Unemployment and Poverty, the
Cause and the Remedy', and then the strangers sang a song called
'England Arise', the first verse being:

        England Arise, the long, long night is over,
        Faint in the east, behold the Dawn appear
        Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow
        Arise, O England!During the progress of the meeting several of the strangers had been
going out amongst the crowd giving away leaflets, which many of the
people gloomily refused to accept, and selling penny pamphlets, of
which they managed to dispose of about three dozen.Before declaring the meeting closed, the chairman said that the speaker
who was coming next week resided in London: he was not a millionaire,
but a workman, the same as nearly all those who were there present.They were not going to pay him anything for coming, but they intended
to pay his railway fare.Therefore next Sunday after the meeting there
would be a collection, and anything over the amount of the fare would
be used for the purchase of more leaflets such as those they were now
giving away.He hoped that anyone who thought that any of the money
went into the pockets of those who held the meeting would come and
join: then they could have their share.The meeting now terminated and the Socialists were suffered to depart
in peace.Some of them, however, lingered amongst the crowd after the
main body had departed, and for a long time after the meeting was over
little groups remained on the field excitedly discussing the speeches
or the leaflets.The next Sunday evening when the Socialists came they found the field
at the Cross Roads in the possession of a furious, hostile mob, who
refused to allow them to speak, and finally they had to go away without
having held a meeting.They came again the next Sunday, and on this
occasion they had a speaker with a very loud--literally a
stentorian--voice, and he succeeded in delivering an address, but as
only those who were very close were able to hear him, and as they were
all Socialists, it was not of much effect upon those for whom it was
intended.They came again the next Sunday and nearly every other Sunday during
the summer: sometimes they were permitted to hold their meeting in
comparative peace and at other times there was a row.They made
several converts, and many people declared themselves in favour of some
of the things advocated, but they were never able to form a branch of
their society there, because nearly all those who were convinced were
afraid to publicly declare themselves lest they should lose their
employment or customers.Chapter 44

The Beano


Now and then a transient gleam of sunshine penetrated the gloom in
which the lives of the philanthropists were passed.The cheerless
monotony was sometimes enlivened with a little innocent merriment.Every now and then there was a funeral which took Misery and Crass away
for the whole afternoon, and although they always tried to keep the
dates secret, the men generally knew when they were gone.Sometimes the people in whose houses they were working regaled them
with tea, bread and butter, cake or other light refreshments, and
occasionally even with beer--very different stuff from the petrifying
liquid they bought at the Cricketers for twopence a pint.At other
places, where the people of the house were not so generously disposed,
the servants made up for it, and entertained them in a similar manner
without the knowledge of their masters and mistresses.Even when the
mistresses were too cunning to permit of this, they were seldom able to
prevent the men from embracing the domestics, who for their part were
quite often willing to be embraced; it was an agreeable episode that
helped to vary the monotony of their lives, and there was no harm done.It was rather hard lines on the philanthropists sometimes when they
happened to be working in inhabited houses of the better sort.They
always had to go in and out by the back way, generally through the
kitchen, and the crackling and hissing of the poultry and the joints of
meat roasting in the ovens, and the odours of fruit pies and tarts, and
plum puddings and sage and onions, were simply maddening.In the
back-yards of these houses there were usually huge stacks of empty
beer, stout and wine bottles, and others that had contained whisky,
brandy or champagne.The smells of the delicious viands that were being prepared in the
kitchen often penetrated into the dismantled rooms that the
philanthropists were renovating, sometimes just as they were eating
their own wretched fare out of their dinner basket, and washing it down
with draughts of the cold tea or the petrifying liquid they sometimes
brought with them in bottles.Sometimes, as has been said, the people of the house used to send up
some tea and bread and butter or cakes or other refreshments to the
workmen, but whenever Hunter got to know of it being done he used to
speak to the people about it and request that it be discontinued, as it
caused the men to waste their time.But the event of the year was the Beano, which took place on the last
Saturday in August, after they had been paying in for about four
months.The cost of the outing was to be five shillings a head, so
this was the amount each man had to pay in, but it was expected that
the total cost--the hire of the brakes and the cost of the
dinner--would come out at a trifle less than the amount stated, and in
that case the surplus would be shared out after the dinner.The amount
of the share-out would be greater or less according to other
circumstances, for it generally happened that apart from the
subscriptions of the men, the Beano fund was swelled by charitable
donations from several quarters, as will be seen later on.When the eventful day arrived, the hands, instead of working till one,
were paid at twelve o'clock and rushed off home to have a wash and
change.The brakes were to start from the 'Cricketers' at one, but it was
arranged, for the convenience of those who lived at Windley, that they
were to be picked up at the Cross Roads at one-thirty.There were four brakes altogether--three large ones for the men and one
small one for the accommodation of Mr Rushton and a few of his personal
friends, Didlum, Grinder, Mr Toonarf, an architect and Mr Lettum, a
house and estate Agent.One of the drivers was accompanied by a friend
who carried a long coachman's horn.This gentleman was not paid to
come, but, being out of work, he thought that the men would be sure to
stand him a few drinks and that they would probably make a collection
for him in return for his services.Most of the chaps were smoking twopenny cigars, and had one or two
drinks with each other to try to cheer themselves up before they
started, but all the same it was a melancholy procession that wended
its way up the hill to Windley.To judge from the mournful expression
on the long face of Misery, who sat on the box beside the driver of the
first large brake, and the downcast appearance of the majority of the
men, one might have thought that it was a funeral rather than a
pleasure party, or that they were a contingent of lost souls being
conducted to the banks of the Styx.The man who from time to time
sounded the coachman's horn might have passed as the angel sounding the
last trump, and the fumes of the cigars were typical of the smoke of
their torment, which ascendeth up for ever and ever.A brief halt was made at the Cross Roads to pick up several of the men,
including Philpot, Harlow, Easton, Ned Dawson, Sawkins, Bill Bates and
the Semi-drunk.The two last-named were now working for Smeariton and
Leavit, but as they had been paying in from the first, they had elected
to go to the Beano rather than have their money back.The Semi-drunk
and one or two other habitual boozers were very shabby and down at
heel, but the majority of the men were decently dressed.Some had taken
their Sunday clothes out of pawn especially for the occasion.Others
were arrayed in new suits which they were going to pay for at the rate
of a shilling a week.Some had bought themselves second-hand suits,
one or two were wearing their working clothes brushed and cleaned up,
and some were wearing Sunday clothes that had not been taken out of
pawn for the simple reason that the pawnbrokers would not take them in.These garments were in what might be called a transition
stage--old-fashioned and shiny with wear, but yet too good to take for
working in, even if their owners had been in a position to buy some
others to take their place for best.Crass, Slyme and one or two of
the single men, however, were howling swells, sporting stand-up collars
and bowler hats of the latest type, in contradistinction to some of the
others, who were wearing hats of antique patterns, and collars of
various shapes with jagged edges.Harlow had on an old straw hat that
his wife had cleaned up with oxalic acid, and Easton had carefully dyed
the faded binding of his black bowler with ink.Their boots were the
worst part of their attire: without counting Rushton and his friends,
there were thirty-seven men altogether, including Nimrod, and there
were not half a dozen pairs of really good boots amongst the whole
crowd.When all were seated a fresh start was made.The small brake, with
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and two or three other members of the Band,
led the way.Next came the largest brake with Misery on the box.Beside the driver of the third brake was Payne, the foreman carpenter.Crass occupied a similar position of honour on the fourth brake, on the
back step of which was perched the man with the coachman's horn.Crass--who had engaged the brakes--had arranged with the drivers that
the cortege should pass through the street where he and Easton lived,
and as they went by Mrs Crass was standing at the door with the two
young men lodgers, who waved their handkerchiefs and shouted greetings.A little further on Mrs Linden and Easton's wife were standing at the
door to see them go by.In fact, the notes of the coachman's horn
alarmed most of the inhabitants, who crowded to their windows and doors
to gaze upon the dismal procession as it passed.The mean streets of Windley were soon left far behind and they found
themselves journeying along a sunlit, winding road, bordered with
hedges of hawthorn, holly and briar, past rich, brown fields of
standing corn, shimmering with gleams of gold, past apple-orchards
where bending boughs were heavily loaded with mellow fruits exhaling
fragrant odours, through the cool shades of lofty avenues of venerable
oaks, whose overarched and interlacing branches formed a roof of green,
gilt and illuminated with quivering spots and shafts of sunlight that
filtered through the trembling leaves; over old mossy stone bridges,
spanning limpid streams that duplicated the blue sky and the fleecy
clouds; and then again, stretching away to the horizon on every side
over more fields, some rich with harvest, others filled with drowsing
cattle or with flocks of timid sheep that scampered away at the sound
of the passing carriages.Several times they saw merry little
companies of rabbits frisking gaily in and out of the hedges or in the
fields beside the sheep and cattle.At intervals, away in the
distance, nestling in the hollows or amid sheltering trees, groups of
farm buildings and stacks of hay; and further on, the square ivy-clad
tower of an ancient church, or perhaps a solitary windmill with its
revolving sails alternately flashing and darkening in the rays of the
sun.Past thatched wayside cottages whose inhabitants came out to wave
their hands in friendly greeting.Past groups of sunburnt,
golden-haired children who climbed on fences and five-barred gates, and
waved their hats and cheered, or ran behind the brakes for the pennies
the men threw down to them.From time to time the men in the brakes made half-hearted attempts at
singing, but it never came to much, because most of them were too
hungry and miserable.They had not had time to take any dinner and
would not have taken any even if they had the time, for they wished to
reserve their appetites for the banquet at the Queen Elizabeth, which
they expected to reach about half past three.However, they cheered up
a little after the first halt--at the Blue Lion, where most of them got
down and had a drink.Some of them, including the Semi-drunk, Ned
Dawson, Bill Bates and Joe Philpot--had two or three drinks, and felt
so much happier for them that, shortly after they started off again,
sounds of melody were heard from the brake the three first named rode
in--the one presided over by Crass--but it was not very successful, and
even after the second halt--about five miles further on--at the
Warrior's Head, they found it impossible to sing with any heartiness.Fitful bursts of song arose from time to time from each of the brakes
in turn, only to die mournfully away.It is not easy to sing on an
empty stomach even if one has got a little beer in it; and so it was
with most of them.They were not in a mood to sing, or to properly
appreciate the scenes through which they were passing.They wanted
their dinners, and that was the reason why this long ride, instead of
being a pleasure, became after a while, a weary journey that seemed as
if it were never coming to an end.The next stop was at the Bird in Hand, a wayside public house that
stood all by itself in a lonely hollow.The landlord was a fat,
jolly-looking man, and there were several customers in the bar--men who
looked like farm-labourers, but there were no other houses to be seen
anywhere.This extraordinary circumstance exercised the minds of our
travellers and formed the principal topic of conversation until they
arrived at the Dew Drop Inn, about half an hour afterwards.The first
brake, containing Rushton and his friends, passed on without stopping
here.The occupants of the second brake, which was only a little way
behind the first, were divided in opinion whether to stop or go on.Some shouted out to the driver to pull up, others ordered him to
proceed, and more were undecided which course to pursue--a state of
mind that was not shared by the coachman, who, knowing that if they
stopped somebody or other would be sure to stand him a drink, had no
difficulty whatever in coming to a decision, but drew rein at the inn,
an example that was followed by both the other carriages as they drove
up.It was a very brief halt, not more than half the men getting down at
all, and those who remained in the brakes grumbled so much at the delay
that the others drank their beer as quickly as possible and the journey
was resumed once more, almost in silence.No attempts at singing, no
noisy laughter; they scarcely spoke to each other, but sat gloomily
gazing out over the surrounding country.Instructions had been given to the drivers not to stop again till they
reached the Queen Elizabeth, and they therefore drove past the World
Turned Upside Down without stopping, much to the chagrin of the
landlord of that house, who stood at the door with a sickly smile upon
his face.Some of those who knew him shouted out that they would give
him a call on their way back, and with this he had to be content.They reached the long-desired Queen Elizabeth at twenty minutes to
four, and were immediately ushered into a large room where a round
table and two long ones were set for dinner--and they were set in a
manner worthy of the reputation of the house.The cloths that covered the tables and the serviettes, arranged fanwise
in the drinking glasses, were literally as white as snow, and about a
dozen knives and forks and spoons were laid for each person.Down the
centre of the table glasses of delicious yellow custard and cut-glass
dishes of glistening red and golden jelly alternated with vases of
sweet-smelling flowers.The floor of the dining-room was covered with oilcloth--red flowers on
a pale yellow ground; the pattern was worn off in places, but it was
all very clean and shining.Whether one looked at the walls with the
old-fashioned varnished oak paper, or at the glossy piano standing
across the corner near the white-curtained window, at the shining oak
chairs or through the open casement doors that led into the shady
garden beyond, the dominating impression one received was that
everything was exquisitely clean.The landlord announced that dinner would be served in ten minutes, and
while they were waiting some of them indulged in a drink at the
bar--just as an appetizer--whilst the others strolled in the garden or,
by the landlord's invitation, looked over the house.Amongst other
places, they glanced into the kitchen, where the landlady was
superintending the preparation of the feast, and in this place, with
its whitewashed walls and red-tiled floor, as in every other part of
the house, the same absolute cleanliness reigned supreme.'It's a bit differint from the Royal Caff, where we got the sack, ain't
it?'remarked the Semi-drunk to Bill Bates as they made their way to
the dining-room in response to the announcement that dinner was ready.Rushton, with Didlum and Grinder and his other friends, sat at the
round table near the piano.Hunter took the head of the longer of the
other two tables and Crass the foot, and on either side of Crass were
Bundy and Slyme, who had acted with him as the Committee who had
arranged the Beano.Payne, the foreman carpenter, occupied the head of
the other table.The dinner was all that could be desired; it was almost as good as the
kind of dinner that is enjoyed every day by those persons who are too
lazy to work but are cunning enough to make others work for them.There was soup, several entrees, roast beef, boiled mutton, roast
turkey, roast goose, ham, cabbage, peas, beans and sweets galore, plum
pudding, custard, jelly, fruit tarts, bread and cheese and as much beer
or lemonade as they liked to pay for, the drinks being an extra; and
afterwards the waiters brought in cups of coffee for those who desired
it.Everything was up to the knocker, and although they were somewhat
bewildered by the multitude of knives and forks, they all, with one or
two exceptions, rose to the occasion and enjoyed themselves famously.The excellent decorum observed being marred only by one or two
regrettable incidents.The first of these occurred almost as soon as
they sat down, when Ned Dawson who, although a big strong fellow, was
not able to stand much beer, not being used to it, was taken ill and
had to be escorted from the room by his mate Bundy and another man.They left him somewhere outside and he came back again about ten
minutes afterwards, much better but looking rather pale, and took his
seat with the others.The turkeys, the roast beef and the boiled mutton, the peas and beans
and the cabbage, disappeared with astonishing rapidity, which was not
to be wondered at, for they were all very hungry from the long drive,
and nearly everyone made a point of having at least one helping of
everything there was to be had.Some of them went in for two lots of
soup.Then for the next course, boiled mutton and ham or turkey: then
some roast beef and goose.Then a little more boiled mutton with a
little roast beef.Each of the three boys devoured several times his
own weight of everything, to say nothing of numerous bottles of
lemonade and champagne ginger beer.Crass frequently paused to mop the perspiration from his face and neck
with his serviette.There was
enough and to spare of everything to eat, the beer was of the best, and
all the time, amid the rattle of the crockery and the knives and forks,
the proceedings were enlivened by many jests and flashes of wit that
continuously kept the table in a roar.'Chuck us over another dollop of that there white stuff, Bob,' shouted
the Semi-drunk to Crass, indicating the blancmange.Crass reached out his hand and took hold of the dish containing the
'white stuff', but instead of passing it to the Semi-drunk, he
proceeded to demolish it himself, gobbling it up quickly directly from
the dish with a spoon.'Why, you're eating it all yerself, yer bleeder,' cried the Semi-drunk
indignantly, as soon as he realized what was happening.'That's all right, matey,' replied Crass affably as he deposited the
empty dish on the table.'It don't matter, there's plenty more where
it come from.Upon being applied to, the landlord, who was assisted by his daughter,
two other young women and two young men, brought in several more lots
and so the Semi-drunk was appeased.As for the plum-pudding--it was a fair knock-out; just like Christmas:
but as Ned Dawson and Bill Bates had drunk all the sauce before the
pudding was served, they all had to have their first helping without
any.However, as the landlord brought in another lot shortly
afterwards, that didn't matter either.As soon as dinner was over, Crass rose to make his statement as
secretary.Thirty-seven men had paid five shillings each: that made
nine pounds five shillings.The committee had decided that the three
boys--the painters' boy, the carpenters' boy and the front shop
boy--should be allowed to come half-price: that made it nine pounds
twelve and six.In addition to paying the ordinary five-shilling
subscription, Mr Rushton had given one pound ten towards the expenses.And several other gentlemen had also given something
towards it.Mr Sweater, of the Cave, one pound.Mr
Grinder, ten shillings in addition to the five-shilling subscription.Mr Lettum, ten shillings, as well as the five-shilling
subscription.Mr Didlum, ten shillings in addition to the
five shillings.Mr Toonarf, ten shillings as well as the
five-shilling subscription.They had also written to some of the
manufacturers who supplied the firm with materials, and asked them to
give something: some of 'em had sent half a crown, some five shillings,
some hadn't answered at all, and two of 'em had written back to say
that as things is cut so fine nowadays, they didn't hardly get no
profit on their stuff, so they couldn't afford to give nothing; but out
of all the firms they wrote to they managed to get thirty-two and
sixpence altogether, making a grand total of seventeen pounds.As for the expenses, the dinner was two and six a head, and there was
forty-five of them there, so that came to five pounds twelve and six.Then there was the hire of the brakes, also two and six a head, five
pound twelve and six, which left a surplus of five pound fifteen to be
shared out (applause), which came to three shillings each for the
thirty-seven men, and one and fourpence for each of the boys.Crass, Slyme and Bundy now walked round the tables distributing the
share-out, which was very welcome to everybody, especially those who
had spent nearly all their money during the journey from Mugsborough,
and when this ceremony was completed, Philpot moved a hearty vote of
thanks to the committee for the manner in which they had carried out
their duties, which was agreed to with acclamation.Then they made a
collection for the waiters, and the three waitresses, which amounted to
eleven shillings, for which the host returned thanks on behalf of the
recipients, who were all smiles.Then Mr Rushton requested the landlord to serve drinks and cigars all
round.Some had cigarettes and the teetotallers had lemonade or ginger
beer.Those who did not smoke themselves took the cigar all the same
and gave it to someone else who did.When all were supplied there
suddenly arose loud cries of 'Order!'and it was seen that Hunter was
upon his feet.As soon as silence was obtained, Misery said that he believed that
everyone there present would agree with him, when he said that they
should not let the occasion pass without drinking the 'ealth of their
esteemed and respected employer, Mr Rushton.Some of
them had worked for Mr Rushton on and off for many years, and as far as
THEY was concerned it was not necessary for him (Hunter) to say much in
praise of Mr Rushton.They knew Mr Rushton as well as
he did himself and to know him was to esteem him.As for the
new hands, although they did not know Mr Rushton as well as the old
hands did, he felt sure that they would agree that as no one could wish
for a better master.He had much pleasure in asking
them to drink Mr Rushton's health.'Musical honours, chaps,' shouted Crass, waving his glass and leading
off the singing which was immediately joined in with great enthusiasm
by most of the men, the Semi-drunk conducting the music with a table
knife:

        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us,
        So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For 'e's a jolly good fellow
        For 'e's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us.Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Everyone present drank Rushton's health, or at any rate went through
the motions of doing so, but during the roar of cheering and singing
that preceded it several of the men stood with expressions of contempt
or uneasiness upon their faces, silently watching the enthusiasts or
looking at the ceiling or on the floor.'I will say this much,' remarked the Semidrunk as they all resumed
their seats--he had had several drinks during dinner, besides those he
had taken on the journey--I will say this much, although I did have a
little misunderstanding with Mr Hunter when I was workin' at the Royal
Caff, I must admit that this is the best firm that's ever worked under
me.'This statement caused a shout of laughter, which, however, died away as
Mr Rushton rose to acknowledge the toast to his health.He said that
he had now been in business for nearly sixteen years and this was--he
believed--the eleventh outing he had had the pleasure of attending.During all that time the business had steadily progressed and had
increased in volume from year to year, and he hoped and believed that
the progress made in the past would be continued in the future.Of course, he realized that the success of the business
depended very largely upon the men as well as upon himself; he did his
best in trying to get work for them, and it was necessary--if the
business was to go on and prosper--that they should also do their best
to get the work done when he had secured it for them.The masters could not do without the men, and the men could not live
without the masters.It was a matter of division of
labour: the men worked with their hands and the masters worked with
their brains, and one was no use without the other.He hoped the good
feeling which had hitherto existed between himself and his workmen
would always continue, and he thanked them for the way in which they
had responded to the toast of his health.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of this speech, and then Crass stood
up and said that he begged to propose the health of Mr 'Unter.He wasn't going to make a long speech as he wasn't much of a
speaker.(Cries of 'You're all right,' 'Go on,' etc.)But he felt
sure as they would all hagree with him when he said that--next to Mr
Rushton--there wasn't no one the men had more respect and liking for
than Mr 'Unter.A few weeks ago when Mr 'Unter was laid up,
many of them began to be afraid as they was going to lose 'im.He was
sure that all the 'ands was glad to 'ave this hoppertunity of
congratulating him on his recovery (Hear, hear) and of wishing him the
best of 'ealth in the future and hoping as he would be spared to come
to a good many more Beanos.Loud applause greeted the conclusion of Crass's remarks, and once more
the meeting burst into song:

        For he's a jolly good fellow
        For he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow,
        And so say all of us.So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!When they had done cheering, Nimrod rose.His voice trembled a little
as he thanked them for their kindness, and said that he hoped he
deserved their goodwill.He could only say that as he was sure as he
always tried to be fair and considerate to everyone.He
would now request the landlord to replenish their glasses.As soon as the drinks were served, Nimrod again rose and said he wished
to propose the healths of their visitors who had so kindly contributed
to their expenses--Mr Lettum, Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf and Mr Grinder.They were very pleased and proud to see them there (Hear,
hear), and he was sure the men would agree with him when he said that
Messrs Lettum, Didlum, Toonarf and Grinder were jolly good fellows.To judge from the manner in which they sang the chorus and cheered, it
was quite evident that most of the hands did agree.When they left
off, Grinder rose to reply on behalf of those included in the toast.He
said that it gave them much pleasure to be there and take part in such
pleasant proceedings and they were glad to think that they had been
able to help to bring it about.It was very gratifying to see the good
feeling that existed between Mr Rushton and his workmen, which was as
it should be, because masters and men was really fellow workers--the
masters did the brain work, the men the 'and work.They was both
workers, and their interests was the same.He liked to see men doing
their best for their master and knowing that their master was doing his
best for them, that he was not only a master, but a friend.That was
what he (Grinder) liked to see--master and men pulling together--doing
their best, and realizing that their interests was identical.If only all masters and men would do this they would find
that everything would go on all right, there would be more work and
less poverty.Let the men do their best for their masters, and the
masters do their best for their men, and they would find that that was
the true solution of the social problem, and not the silly nonsense
that was talked by people what went about with red flags.Most of those fellows were chaps who was too lazy to work
for their livin'.They could take it from him that, if
ever the Socialists got the upper hand there would just be a few of the
hartful dodgers who would get all the cream, and there would be nothing
left but 'ard work for the rest.That's wot hall those
hagitators was after: they wanted them (his hearers) to work and keep
'em in idleness.On behalf of Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf, Mr
Lettum and himself, he thanked them for their good wishes, and hoped to
be with them on a sim'ler occasion in the future.Loud cheers greeted the termination of his speech, but it was obvious
from some of the men's faces that they resented Grinder's remarks.These men ridiculed Socialism and regularly voted for the continuance
of capitalism, and yet they were disgusted and angry with Grinder!There was also a small number of Socialists--not more than half a dozen
altogether--who did not join in the applause.These men were all
sitting at the end of the long table presided over by Payne.None of
them had joined in the applause that greeted the speeches, and so far
neither had they made any protest.Some of them turned very red as
they listened to the concluding sentences of Grinder's oration, and
others laughed, but none of them said anything.They knew before they
came that there was sure to be a lot of 'Jolly good fellow' business
and speechmaking, and they had agreed together beforehand to take no
part one way or the other, and to refrain from openly dissenting from
anything that might be said, but they had not anticipated anything
quite so strong as this.When Grinder sat down some of those who had applauded him began to jeer
at the Socialists.'What have you got to say to that?''They ain't got nothing to say now.''Why don't some of you get up and make a speech?'This last appeared to be a very good idea to those Liberals and Tories
who had not liked Grinder's observations, so they all began to shout
'Owen!'Several of those who had been loudest in applauding Grinder
also joined in the demand that Owen should make a speech, because they
were certain that Grinder and the other gentlemen would be able to
dispose of all his arguments; but Owen and the other Socialists made no
response except to laugh, so presently Crass tied a white handkerchief
on a cane walking-stick that belonged to Mr Didlum, and stuck it in the
vase of flowers that stood on the end of the table where the Socialist
group were sitting.When the noise had in some measure ceased, Grinder again rose.'When I
made the few remarks that I did, I didn't know as there was any
Socialists 'ere: I could tell from the look of you that most of you had
more sense.At the same time I'm rather glad I said what I did,
because it just shows you what sort of chaps these Socialists are.They're pretty artful--they know when to talk and when to keep their
mouths shut.What they like is to get hold of a few ignorant workin'
men in a workshop or a public house, and then they can talk by the
mile--reg'ler shop lawyers, you know wot I mean--I'm right and
everybody else is wrong.You know the sort of thing I
mean.When they finds theirselves in the company of edicated people
wot knows a little more than they does theirselves, and who isn't
likely to be misled by a lot of claptrap, why then, mum's the word.So
next time you hears any of these shop lawyers' arguments, you'll know
how much it's worth.'Most of the men were delighted with this speech, which was received
with much laughing and knocking on the tables.They remarked to each
other that Grinder was a smart man: he'd got the Socialists weighed up
just about right--to an ounce.Then, it was seen that Barrington was on his feet facing Grinder and a
sudden, awe-filled silence fell.'It may or may not be true,' began Barrington, 'that Socialists always
know when to speak and when to keep silent, but the present occasion
hardly seemed a suitable one to discuss such subjects.'We are here today as friends and want to forget our differences and
enjoy ourselves for a few hours.But after what Mr Grinder has said I
am quite ready to reply to him to the best of my ability.'The fact that I am a Socialist and that I am here today as one of Mr
Rushton's employees should be an answer to the charge that Socialists
are too lazy to work for their living.And as to taking advantage of
the ignorance and simplicity of working men and trying to mislead them
with nonsensical claptrap, it would have been more to the point if Mr
Grinder had taken some particular Socialist doctrine and had proved it
to be untrue or misleading, instead of adopting the cowardly method of
making vague general charges that he cannot substantiate.He would
find it far more difficult to do that than it would be for a Socialist
to show that most of what Mr Grinder himself has been telling us is
nonsensical claptrap of the most misleading kind.He tells us that the
employers work with their brains and the men with their hands.If it
is true that no brains are required to do manual labour, why put idiots
into imbecile asylums?Why not let them do some of the hand work for
which no brains are required?As they are idiots, they would probably
be willing to work for even less than the ideal "living wage".If Mr
Grinder had ever tried, he would know that manual workers have to
concentrate their minds and their attention on their work or they would
not be able to do it at all.His talk about employers being not only
the masters but the "friends" of their workmen is also mere claptrap
because he knows as well as we do, that no matter how good or
benevolent an employer may be, no matter how much he might desire to
give his men good conditions, it is impossible for him to do so,
because he has to compete against other employers who do not do that.It is the bad employer--the sweating, slave-driving employer--who sets
the pace and the others have to adopt the same methods--very often
against their inclinations--or they would not be able to compete with
him.If any employer today were to resolve to pay his workmen not less
wages than he would be able to live upon in comfort himself, that he
would not require them to do more work in a day than he himself would
like to perform every day of his own life, Mr Grinder knows as well as
we do that such an employer would be bankrupt in a month; because he
would not be able to get any work except by taking it at the same price
as the sweaters and the slave-drivers.'He also tells us that the interests of masters and men are identical;
but if an employer has a contract, it is to his interest to get the
work done as soon as possible; the sooner it is done the more profit he
will make; but the more quickly it is done, the sooner will the men be
out of employment.How then can it be true that their interests are
identical?'Again, let us suppose that an employer is, say, thirty years of age
when he commences business, and that he carries it on for twenty years.Let us assume that he employs forty men more or less regularly during
that period and that the average age of these men is also thirty years
at the time the employer commences business.At the end of the twenty
years it usually happens that the employer has made enough money to
enable him to live for the remainder of his life in ease and comfort.All through those twenty years they have
earned but a bare living wage and have had to endure such privations
that those who are not already dead are broken in health.'In the case of the employer there had been twenty years of steady
progress towards ease and leisure and independence.In the case of the
majority of the men there were twenty years of deterioration, twenty
years of steady, continuous and hopeless progress towards physical and
mental inefficiency: towards the scrap-heap, the work-house, and
premature death.What is it but false, misleading, nonsensical
claptrap to say that their interests were identical with those of their
employer?'Such talk as that is not likely to deceive any but children or fools.We are not children, but it is very evident that Mr Grinder thinks that
we are fools.'Occasionally it happens, through one or more of a hundred different
circumstances over which he has no control, or through some error of
judgement, that after many years of laborious mental work an employer
is overtaken by misfortune, and finds himself no better and even worse
off than when he started; but these are exceptional cases, and even if
he becomes absolutely bankrupt he is no worse off than the majority of
the workmen.'At the same time it is quite true that the real interests of employers
and workmen are the same, but not in the sense that Mr Grinder would
have us believe.Under the existing system of society but a very few
people, no matter how well off they may be, can be certain that they or
their children will not eventually come to want; and even those who
think they are secure themselves, find their happiness diminished by
the knowledge of the poverty and misery that surrounds them on every
side.'In that sense only is it true that the interests of masters and men
are identical, for it is to the interest of all, both rich and poor, to
help to destroy a system that inflicts suffering upon the many and
allows true happiness to none.It is to the interest of all to try and
find a better way.'Here Crass jumped up and interrupted, shouting out that they hadn't
come there to listen to a lot of speechmaking--a remark that was
greeted with unbounded applause by most of those present.Loud cries
of 'Hear, hear!'resounded through the room, and the Semi-drunk
suggested that someone should sing a song.The men who had clamoured for a speech from Owen said nothing, and Mr
Grinder, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, was secretly very
glad of the interruption.The Semi-drunk's suggestion that someone should sing a song was
received with unqualified approbation by everybody, including
Barrington and the other Socialists, who desired nothing better than
that the time should be passed in a manner suitable to the occasion.The landlord's daughter, a rosy girl of about twenty years of age, in a
pink print dress, sat down at the piano, and the Semi-drunk, taking his
place at the side of the instrument and facing the audience, sang the
first song with appropriate gestures, the chorus being rendered
enthusiastically by the full strength of the company, including Misery,
who by this time was slightly drunk from drinking gin and ginger beer:

        'Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come, come, come an' shake 'ands with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come an' take 'old of me 'and
        Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me,
        Down by the old Bull and Bush,
        Bush!Protracted knocking on the tables greeted the end of the song, but as
the Semi-drunk knew no other except odd verses and choruses, he called
upon Crass for the next, and that gentleman accordingly sang 'Work,
Boys, Work' to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are
marching'.As this song is the Marseillaise of the Tariff Reform
Party, voicing as it does the highest ideals of the Tory workmen of
this country, it was an unqualified success, for most of them were
Conservatives.'Now I'm not a wealthy man,
        But I lives upon a plan
        Wot will render me as 'appy as a King;
        An' if you will allow, I'll sing it to you now,
        For time you know is always on the wing.Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal.For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye--
        If you'll only put yer shoulder to the wheel.''Altogether, boys,' shouted Grinder, who was a strong Tariff Reformer,
and was delighted to see that most of the men were of the same way of
thinking; and the 'boys' roared out the chorus once more:

        Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal
        For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye
        If you'll only put your shoulder to the wheel.As they sang the words of this noble chorus the Tories seemed to become
inspired with lofty enthusiasm.It is of course impossible to say for
certain, but probably as they sang there arose before their exalted
imaginations, a vision of the Past, and looking down the long vista of
the years that were gone, they saw that from their childhood they had
been years of poverty and joyless toil.They saw their fathers and
mothers, weaned and broken with privation and excessive labour, sinking
unhonoured into the welcome oblivion of the grave.And then, as a change came over the spirit of their dream, they saw the
Future, with their own children travelling along the same weary road to
the same kind of goal.It is possible that visions of this character were conjured up in their
minds by the singing, for the words of the song gave expression to
their ideal of what human life should be.That was all they wanted--to
be allowed to work like brutes for the benefit of other people.They
did not want to be civilized themselves and they intended to take good
care that the children they had brought into the world should never
enjoy the benefits of civilization either.As they often said:

'Who and what are our children that they shouldn't be made to work for
their betters?They're not Gentry's children, are they?The good
things of life was never meant for the likes of them.That's wot the likes of them was made for, and if we can only get
Tariff Reform for 'em they will always be sure of plenty of it--not
only Full Time, but Overtime!As for edication, travellin' in furrin'
parts, an' enjoying life an' all sich things as that, they was never
meant for the likes of our children--they're meant for Gentry's
children!Our children is only like so much dirt compared with
Gentry's children!That's wot the likes of us is made for--to Work for
Gentry, so as they can 'ave plenty of time to enjoy theirselves; and
the Gentry is made to 'ave a good time so as the likes of us can 'ave
Plenty of Work.'There were several more verses, and by the time they had sung them all,
the Tories were in a state of wild enthusiasm.Even Ned Dawson, who
had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms on the table,
roused himself up at the end of each verse, and after having joined in
the chorus, went to sleep again.At the end of the song they gave three cheers for Tariff Reform and
Plenty of Work, and then Crass, who, as the singer of the last song,
had the right to call upon the next man, nominated Philpot, who
received an ovation when he stood up, for he was a general favourite.He never did no harm to nobody, and he was always wiling to do anyone a
good turn whenever he had the opportunity.Shouts of 'Good old Joe'
resounded through the room as he crossed over to the piano, and in
response to numerous requests for 'The old song' he began to sing 'The
Flower Show':

        'Whilst walkin' out the other night, not knowing where to go
        I saw a bill upon a wall about a Flower Show.So I thought the flowers I'd go and see to pass away the night.And when I got into that Show it was a curious sight.So with your kind intention and a little of your aid,
        Tonight some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'Omnes:
        To-night some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'There were several more verses, from which it appeared that the
principal flowers in the Show were the Rose, the Thistle and the
Shamrock.When he had finished, the applause was so deafening and the demands for
an encore so persistent that to satisfy them he sang another old
favourite--'Won't you buy my pretty flowers?''Ever coming, ever going,
        Men and women hurry by,
        Heedless of the tear-drops gleaming,
        In her sad and wistful eye
        How her little heart is sighing
        Thro' the cold and dreary hours,
        Only listen to her crying,
        "Won't you buy my pretty flowers?"'When the last verse of this sang had been sung five er six times,
Philpot exercised his right of nominating the next singer, and called
upon Dick Wantley, who with many suggestive gestures and grimaces sang
'Put me amongst the girls', and afterwards called upon Payne, the
foreman carpenter, who gave 'I'm the Marquis of Camberwell Green'.There was a lot of what music-hall artists call 'business' attached to
his song, and as he proceeded, Payne, who was ghastly pale and very
nervous, went through a lot of galvanic motions and gestures, bowing
and scraping and sliding about and flourishing his handkerchief in
imitation of the courtly graces of the Marquis.During this
performance the audience maintained an appalling silence, which so
embarrassed Payne that before he was half-way through the song he had
to stop because he could not remember the rest.However, to make up
for this failure he sang another called 'We all must die, like the fire
in the grate'.This also was received in a very lukewarm manner by the
crowd, same of whom laughed and others suggested that if he couldn't
sing any better than that, the sooner HE was dead the better.This was followed by another Tory ballad, the chorus being as follows:

        His clothes may be ragged, his hands may be soiled.But where's the disgrace if for bread he has toiled.His 'art is in the right place, deny it no one can
        The backbone of Old England is the honest workin' man.'After a few more songs it was decided to adjourn to a field at the rear
of the tavern to have a game of cricket.Sides were formed, Rushton,
Didlum, Grinder, and the other gentlemen taking part just as if they
were only common people, and while the game was in progress the rest
played ring quoits or reclined on the grass watching the players,
whilst the remainder amused themselves drinking beer and playing cards
and shove-ha'penny in the bar parlour, or taking walks around the
village sampling the beer at the other pubs, of which there were three.The time passed in this manner until seven o'clock, the hour at which
it had been arranged to start on the return journey; but about a
quarter of an hour before they set out an unpleasant incident occurred.During the time that they were playing cricket a party of glee singers,
consisting of four young girls and five men, three of whom were young
fellows, the other two being rather elderly, possibly the fathers of
some of the younger members of the party, came into the field and sang
several part songs for their entertainment.Towards the close of the
game most of the men had assembled in this field, and during a pause in
the singing the musicians sent one of their number, a shy girl about
eighteen years of age--who seemed as if she would rather that someone
else had the task--amongst the crowd to make a collection.The girl
was very nervous and blushed as she murmured her request, and held out
a straw hat that evidently belonged to one of the male members of the
glee party.A few of the men gave pennies, some refused or pretended
not to see either the girl or the hat, others offered to give her some
money for a kiss, but what caused the trouble was that two or three of
those who had been drinking more than was good for them dropped the
still burning ends of their cigars, all wet with saliva as they were,
into the hat and Dick Wantley spit into it.The girl hastily returned to her companions, and as she went some of
the men who had witnessed the behaviour of those who had insulted her,
advised them to make themselves scarce, as they stood a good chance of
getting a thrashing from the girl's friends.They said it would serve
them dam' well right if they did get a hammering.Partly sobered by fear, the three culprits sneaked off and hid
themselves, pale and trembling with terror, under the box seats of the
three brakes.They had scarcely left when the men of the glee party
came running up, furiously demanding to see those who had insulted the
girl.As they could get no satisfactory answer, one of their number
ran back and presently returned, bringing the girl with him, the other
young women following a little way behind.She said she could not see the men they were looking for, so they went
down to the public house to see if they could find them there, some of
the Rushton's men accompanying them and protesting their indignation.The time passed quickly enough and by half past seven the brakes were
loaded up again and a start made for the return journey.They called at all the taverns on the road, and by the time they
reached the Blue Lion half of them were three sheets in the wind, and
five or six were very drunk, including the driver of Crass's brake and
the man with the bugle.The latter was so far gone that they had to
let him lie down in the bottom of the carriage amongst their feet,
where he fell asleep, while the others amused themselves by blowing
weird shrieks out of the horn.There was an automatic penny-in-the-slot piano at the Blue Lion and as
that was the last house of the road they made a rather long stop there,
playing hooks and rings, shove-ha'penny, drinking, singing, dancing and
finally quarrelling.Several of them seemed disposed to quarrel with Newman.All sorts of
offensive remarks were made at him in his hearing.Once someone
ostentatiously knocked his glass of lemonade over, and a little later
someone else collided violently with him just as he was in the act of
drinking, causing his lemonade to spill all over his clothes.The
worst of it was that most of these rowdy ones were his fellow
passengers in Crass's brake, and there was not much chance of getting a
seat in either of the other carriages, for they were overcrowded
already.From the remarks he overheard from time to time, Newman guessed the
reason of their hostility, and as their manner towards him grew more
menacing, he became so nervous that he began to think of quietly
sneaking off and walking the remainder of the way home by himself,
unless he could get somebody in one of the other brakes to change seats
with him.Whilst these thoughts were agitating his mind, Dick Wantley suddenly
shouted out that he was going to go for the dirty tyke who had offered
to work under price last winter.It was his fault that they were all working for sixpence halfpenny and
he was going to wipe the floor with him.Some of his friends eagerly
offered to assist, but others interposed, and for a time it looked as
if there was going to be a free fight, the aggressors struggling hard
to get at their inoffensive victim.Eventually, however, Newman found a seat in Misery's brake, squatting
on the floor with his back to the horses, thankful enough to be out of
reach of the drunken savages, who were now roaring out ribald songs and
startling the countryside, as they drove along, with unearthly blasts
on the coach horn.Meantime, although none of them seemed to notice it, the brake was
travelling at a furious rate, and swaying about from side to side in a
very erratic manner.It would have been the last carriage, but things
had got a bit mixed at the Blue Lion and, instead of bringing up the
rear of the procession, it was now second, just behind the small
vehicle containing Rushton and his friends.Crass several times reminded them that the other carriage was so near
that Rushton must be able to hear every word that was said, and these
repeated admonitions at length enraged the Semi-drunk, who shouted out
that they didn't care a b--r if he could hear.'You're only a dirty toe-rag!That's all you are--a bloody rotter!That's the only reason you gets put in charge of jobs--'cos you're a
good <DW65>-driver!You're a bloody sight worse than Rushton or Misery
either!Who was it started the one-man, one-room dodge, eh?'Knock 'im orf 'is bleedin' perch,' suggested Bundy.Everybody seemed to think this was a very good idea, but when the
Semi-drunk attempted to rise for the purpose of carrying it out, he was
thrown down by a sudden lurch of the carriage on the top of the
prostrate figure of the bugle man and by the time the others had
assisted him back to his seat they had forgotten all about their plan
of getting rid of Crass.Meantime the speed of the vehicle had increased to a fearful rate.Rushton and the other occupants of the little wagonette in front had
been for some time shouting to them to moderate the pace of their
horses, but as the driver of Crass's brake was too drunk to understand
what they said he took no notice, and they had no alternative but to
increase their own speed to avoid being run down.The drunken driver
now began to imagine that they were trying to race him, and became
fired with the determination to pass them.It was a very narrow road,
but there was just about room to do it, and he had sufficient
confidence in his own skill with the ribbons to believe that he could
get past in safety.The terrified gesticulations and the shouts of Rushton's party only
served to infuriate him, because he imagined that they were jeering at
him for not being able to overtake them.He stood up on the footboard
and lashed the horses till they almost flew over the ground, while the
carriage swayed and skidded in a fearful manner.In front, the horses of Rushton's conveyance were also galloping at top
speed, the vehicle bounding and reeling from one side of the road to
the other, whilst its terrified occupants, whose faces were blanched
with apprehension, sat clinging to their seats and to each other, their
eyes projecting from the sockets as they gazed back with terror at
their pursuers, some of whom were encouraging the drunken driver with
promises of quarts of beer, and urging on the horses with curses and
yells.Crass's fat face was pallid with fear as he clung trembling to his
seat.Another man, very drunk and oblivious of everything, was leaning
over the side of the brake, spewing into the road, while the remainder,
taking no interest in the race, amused themselves by singing--conducted
by the Semi-drunk--as loud as they could roar:

        'Has anyone seen a Germin band,
        Germin Band, Germin Band?I've been lookin' about,
        Pom--Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom!'I've searched every pub, both near and far,
        Near and far, near and far,
        I want my Fritz,
        What plays tiddley bits
        On the big trombone!'The one presided over by
Hunter contained a mournful crew.Nimrod himself, from the effects of
numerous drinks of ginger beer with secret dashes of gin in it, had
become at length crying drunk, and sat weeping in gloomy silence beside
the driver, a picture of lachrymose misery and but dimly conscious of
his surroundings, and Slyme, who rode with Hunter because he was a
fellow member of the Shining Light Chapel.Then there was another
paperhanger--an unhappy wretch who was afflicted with religious mania;
he had brought a lot of tracts with him which he had distributed to the
other men, to the villagers of Tubberton and to anybody else who would
take them.Most of the other men who rode in Nimrod's brake were of the
'religious' working man type.Ignorant, shallow-pated dolts, without
as much intellectuality as an average cat.Attendants at various PSAs
and 'Church Mission Halls' who went every Sunday afternoon to be
lectured on their duty to their betters and to have their minds--save
the mark!--addled and stultified by such persons as Rushton, Sweater,
Didlum and Grinder, not to mention such mental specialists as the holy
reverend Belchers and Boshers, and such persons as John Starr.At these meetings none of the'respectable' working men were allowed to
ask any questions, or to object to, or find fault with anything that
was said, or to argue, or discuss, or criticize.They had to sit there
like a lot of children while they were lectured and preached at and
patronized.Even as sheep before their shearers are dumb, so they were
not permitted to open their mouths.For that matter they did not wish
to be allowed to ask any questions, or to discuss anything.They sat there and listened to what was said,
but they had but a very hazy conception of what it was all about.Most of them belonged to these PSAs merely for the sake of the loaves
and fishes.Every now and then they were awarded prizes--Self-help by
Smiles, and other books suitable for perusal by persons suffering from
almost complete obliteration of the mental faculties.Besides other
benefits there was usually a Christmas Club attached to the 'PSA' or
'Mission' and the things were sold to the members slightly below cost
as a reward for their servility.They were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who
contentedly resigned themselves to a life of miserable toil and
poverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring to the
same fate.Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or
the Red Indians are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.They call no man master; and if they do not enjoy the benefits
of science and civilization, neither do they toil to create those
things for the benefit of others.And as for their children--most of
those savages would rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than
allow them to grow up to be half-starved drudges for other men.But these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling
and cringing and toiling and running about like little dogs at the
behest of their numerous masters.And as for the benefits of science
and civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them,
and then to watch other men enjoy them.And all the time they were
tame and quiet and content and said, 'The likes of us can't expect to
'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot's been good enough for
us is good enough for the likes of them.'But although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to
be robbed on a large scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace
and petty affairs of their everyday existence, most of these men were
acutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own
selfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular
cunning which characterizes this form of dementia.That was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod's brake--because they
wished to chum up with him as much as possible, in order to increase
their chances of being kept on in preference to others who were not so
respectable.Some of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close
examination would have shown that the size was due to the extraordinary
thickness of the bones.The cavity of the skull was not so large as
the outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to
suppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair
size, it was of inferior quality, being coarse in texture and to a
great extent composed of fat.Although most of them were regular attendants at some place of
so-called worship, they were not all teetotallers, and some of them
were now in different stages of intoxication, not because they had had
a great deal to drink, but because--being usually abstemious--it did
not take very much to make them drunk.From time to time this miserable crew tried to enliven the journey by
singing, but as most of them only knew odd choruses it did not come to
much.As for the few who did happen to know all the words of a song,
they either had no voices or were not inclined to sing.The most
successful contribution was that of the religious maniac, who sang
several hymns, the choruses being joined in by everybody, both drunk
and sober.The strains of these hymns, wafted back through the balmy air to the
last coach, were the cause of much hilarity to its occupants who also
sang the choruses.As they had all been brought up under 'Christian'
influences and educated in 'Christian' schools, they all knew the
words: 'Work, for the night is coming', 'Turn poor Sinner and escape
Eternal Fire', 'Pull for the Shore' and 'Where is my Wandering Boy?'The last reminded Harlow of a song he knew nearly all the words of,
'Take the news to Mother', the singing of which was much appreciated by
all present and when it was finished they sang it all over again,
Philpot being so affected that he actually shed tears; and Easton
confided to Owen that there was no getting away from the fact that a
boy's best friend is his mother.In this last carriage, as in the other two, there were several men who
were more or less intoxicated and for the same reason--because not
being used to taking much liquor, the few extra glasses they had drunk
had got into their heads.They were as sober a lot of fellows as need
be at ordinary times, and they had flocked together in this brake
because they were all of about the same character--not tame, contented
imbeciles like most of those in Misery's carnage, but men something
like Harlow, who, although dissatisfied with their condition, doggedly
continued the hopeless, weary struggle against their fate.They were not teetotallers and they never went to either church or
chapel, but they spent little in drink or on any form of enjoyment--an
occasional glass of beer or a still rarer visit to a music-hall and now
and then an outing more or less similar to this being the sum total of
their pleasures.These four brakes might fitly be regarded as so many travelling lunatic
asylums, the inmates of each exhibiting different degrees and forms of
mental disorder.The occupants of the first--Rushton, Didlum and Co.--might be classed
as criminal lunatics who injured others as well as themselves.In a
properly constituted system of society such men as these would be
regarded as a danger to the community, and would be placed under such
restraint as would effectually prevent them from harming themselves or
others.These wretches had abandoned every thought and thing that
tends to the elevation of humanity.They had given up everything that
makes life good and beautiful, in order to carry on a mad struggle to
acquire money which they would never be sufficiently cultured to
properly enjoy.Deaf and blind to every other consideration, to this
end they had degraded their intellects by concentrating them upon the
minutest details of expense and profit, and for their reward they raked
in their harvest of muck and lucre along with the hatred and curses of
those they injured in the process.They knew that the money they
accumulated was foul with the sweat of their brother men, and wet with
the tears of little children, but they were deaf and blind and callous
to the consequences of their greed.Devoid of every ennobling thought
or aspiration, they grovelled on the filthy ground, tearing up the
flowers to get at the worms.In the coach presided over by Crass, Bill Bates, the Semi-drunk and the
other two or three habitual boozers were all men who had been driven
mad by their environment.At one time most of them had been fellows
like Harlow, working early and late whenever they got the chance, only
to see their earnings swallowed up in a few minutes every Saturday by
the landlord and all the other host of harpies and profitmongers, who
were waiting to demand it as soon as it was earned.In the years that
were gone, most of these men used to take all their money home
religiously every Saturday and give it to the 'old girl' for the house,
and then, lo and behold, in a moment, yea, even in the twinkling of an
eye, it was all gone!and nothing to
show for it except an insufficiency of the bare necessaries of life!But after a time they had become heartbroken and sick and tired of that
sort of thing.They hankered after a little pleasure, a little
excitement, a little fun, and they found that it was possible to buy
something like those in quart pots at the pub.They knew they were not
the genuine articles, but they were better than nothing at all, and so
they gave up the practice of giving all their money to the old girl to
give to the landlord and the other harpies, and bought beer with some
of it instead; and after a time their minds became so disordered from
drinking so much of this beer, that they cared nothing whether the rent
was paid or not.They cared but little whether the old girl and the
children had food or clothes.They said, 'To hell with everything and
everyone,' and they cared for nothing so long as they could get plenty
of beer.The occupants of Nimrod's coach have already been described and most of
them may correctly be classed as being similar to <DW35> idiots of the
third degree--very cunning and selfish, and able to read and write, but
with very little understanding of what they read except on the most
common topics.As for those who rode with Harlow in the last coach, most of them, as
has been already intimated, were men of similar character to himself.The greater number of them fairly good workmen and--unlike the boozers
in Crass's coach--not yet quite heartbroken, but still continuing the
hopeless struggle against poverty.These differed from Nimrod's lot
inasmuch as they were not content.They were always complaining of
their wretched circumstances, and found a certain kind of pleasure in
listening to the tirades of the Socialists against the existing social
conditions, and professing their concurrence with many of the
sentiments expressed, and a desire to bring about a better state of
affairs.Most of them appeared to be quite sane, being able to converse
intelligently on any ordinary subject without discovering any symptoms
of mental disorder, and it was not until the topic of Parliamentary
elections was mentioned that evidence of their insanity was
forthcoming.It then almost invariably appeared that they were subject
to the most extraordinary hallucinations and extravagant delusions, the
commonest being that the best thing that the working people could do to
bring about an improvement in their condition, was to continue to elect
their Liberal and Tory employers to make laws for and to rule over
them!At such times, if anyone ventured to point out to them that that
was what they had been doing all their lives, and referred them to the
manifold evidences that met them wherever they turned their eyes of its
folly and futility, they were generally immediately seized with a
paroxysm of the most furious mania, and were with difficulty prevented
from savagely assaulting those who differed from them.They were usually found in a similar condition of maniacal excitement
for some time preceding and during a Parliamentary election, but
afterwards they usually manifested that modification of insanity which
is called melancholia.In fact they alternated between these two forms
of the disease.During elections, the highest state of exalted mania;
and at ordinary times--presumably as a result of reading about the
proceedings in Parliament of the persons whom they had elected--in a
state of melancholic depression, in their case an instance of hope
deferred making the heart sick.This condition occasionally proved to be the stage of transition into
yet another modification of the disease--that known as dipsomania, the
phase exhibited by Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk.Yet another form of insanity was that shown by the Socialists.Like
most of their fellow passengers in the last coach, the majority of
these individuals appeared to be of perfectly sound mind.Upon
entering into conversation with them one found that they reasoned
correctly and even brilliantly.They had divided their favourite
subject into three parts.First; an exact definition of the condition
known as Poverty.Secondly; a knowledge of the causes of Poverty; and
thirdly, a rational plan for the cure of Poverty.Those who were
opposed to them always failed to refute their arguments, and feared,
and nearly always refused, to meet them in fair fight--in open
debate--preferring to use the cowardly and despicable weapons of
slander and misrepresentation.The fact that these Socialists never
encountered their opponents except to defeat them, was a powerful
testimony to the accuracy of their reasonings and the correctness of
their conclusions--and yet they were undoubtedly mad.One might
converse with them for an indefinite time on the three divisions of
their subject without eliciting any proofs of insanity, but directly
one inquired what means they proposed to employ in order to bring about
the adoption of their plan, they replied that they hoped to do so by
reasoning with the others!Although they had sense enough to understand the real causes of
poverty, and the only cure for poverty, they were nevertheless so
foolish that they entertained the delusion that it is possible to
reason with demented persons, whereas every sane person knows that to
reason with a maniac is not only fruitless, but rather tends to fix
more deeply the erroneous impressions of his disordered mind.The wagonette containing Rushton and his friends continued to fly over
the road, pursued by the one in which rode Crass, Bill Bates, and the
Semi-drunk; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the drunken driver,
they were unable to overtake or pass the smaller vehicle, and when they
reached the foot of the hill that led up to Windley the distance
between the two carriages rapidly increased, and the race was
reluctantly abandoned.When they reached the top of the hill Rushton and his friends did not
wait for the others, but drove off towards Mugsborough as fast as they
could.Crass's brake was the next to arrive at the summit, and they halted
there to wait for the other two conveyances and when they came up all
those who lived nearby got out, and some of them sang 'God Save the
King', and then with shouts of 'Good Night', and cries of 'Don't forget
six o'clock Monday morning', they dispersed to their homes and the
carriages moved off once more.At intervals as they passed through Windley brief stoppages were made
in order to enable others to get out, and by the time they reached the
top of the long incline that led down into Mugsborough it was nearly
twelve o'clock and the brakes were almost empty, the only passengers
being Owen and four or five others who lived down town.By ones and
twos these also departed, disappearing into the obscurity of the night,
until there was none left, and the Beano was an event of the past.Chapter 45

The Great Oration


The outlook for the approaching winter was--as usual--gloomy in the
extreme.One of the leading daily newspapers published an article
prophesying a period of severe industrial depression.'As the
warehouses were glutted with the things produced by the working
classes, there was no need for them to do any more work--at present;
and so they would now have to go and starve until such time as their
masters had sold or consumed the things already produced.'Of course,
the writer of the article did not put it exactly like that, but that
was what it amounted to.This article was quoted by nearly all the
other papers, both Liberal and Conservative.The Tory papers--ignoring
the fact that all the Protectionist countries were in exactly the same
condition, published yards of misleading articles about Tariff Reform.The Liberal papers said Tariff Reform was no remedy.Look at America
and Germany--worse than here!Still, the situation was undoubtedly
very serious--continued the Liberal papers--and Something would have to
be done.They did not say exactly what, because, of course, they did
not know; but Something would have to be done--tomorrow.They talked
vaguely about Re-afforestation, and Reclaiming of Foreshores, and Sea
walls: but of course there was the question of Cost!But all the same Something would have to be done.Great caution was necessary in dealing with
such difficult problems!We must go slow, and if in the meantime a few
thousand children die of starvation, or become 'rickety' or consumptive
through lack of proper nutrition it is, of course, very regrettable,
but after all they are only working-class children, so it doesn't
matter a great deal.Most of the writers of these Liberal and Tory papers seemed to think
that all that was necessary was to find 'Work' for the 'working' class!That was their conception of a civilized nation in the twentieth
century!For the majority of the people to work like brutes in order
to obtain a 'living wage' for themselves and to create luxuries for a
small minority of persons who are too lazy to work at all!And
although this was all they thought was necessary, they did not know
what to do in order to bring even that much to pass!Winter was
returning, bringing in its train the usual crop of horrors, and the
Liberal and Tory monopolists of wisdom did not know what to do!Rushton's had so little work in that nearly all the hands expected that
they would be slaughtered the next Saturday after the 'Beano' and there
was one man--Jim Smith he was called--who was not allowed to live even
till then: he got the sack before breakfast on the Monday morning after
the Beano.This man was about forty-five years old, but very short for his age,
being only a little over five feet in height.The other men used to
say that Little Jim was not made right, for while his body was big
enough for a six-footer, his legs were very short, and the fact that he
was rather inclined to be fat added to the oddity of his appearance.On the Monday morning after the Beano he was painting an upper room in
a house where several other men were working, and it was customary for
the coddy to shout 'Yo!at mealtimes, to let the hands know when
it was time to leave off work.At about ten minutes to eight, Jim had
squared the part of the work he had been doing--the window--so he
decided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast.Whilst he was waiting for the foreman to shout 'Yo!his mind
reverted to the Beano, and he began to hum the tunes of some of the
songs that had been sung.He hummed the tune of 'He's a jolly good
fellow', and he could not get the tune out of his mind: it kept buzzing
in his head.It could not be very far
off eight now, to judge by the amount of work he had done since six
o'clock.He had rubbed down and stopped all the woodwork and painted
the window.He was only getting
sixpence-halfpenny an hour and if he hadn't earned a bob he hadn't
earned nothing!Anyhow, whether he had done enough for 'em or not he
wasn't goin' to do no more before breakfast.The tune of 'He's a jolly good fellow' was still buzzing in his head;
he thrust his hands deep down in his trouser pockets, and began to
polka round the room, humming softly:

        'I won't do no more before breakfast!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray So 'ip 'ip 'ooray!I won't do no more before breakfast--etc.'and you won't do but very little after breakfast, here!'shouted
Hunter, suddenly entering the room.'I've bin watchin' of you through the crack of the door for the last
'arf hour; and you've not done a dam' stroke all the time.You make
out yer time sheet, and go to the office at nine o'clock and git yer
money; we can't afford to pay you for playing the fool.'Leaving the man dumbfounded and without waiting for a reply, Misery
went downstairs and after kicking up a devil of a row with the foreman
for the lack of discipline on the job, he instructed him that Smith was
not to be permitted to resume work after breakfast.He had come in so stealthily that no one had known anything of his
arrival until they heard him bellowing at Smith.The latter did not stay to take breakfast but went off at once, and
when he was gone the other chaps said it served him bloody well right:
he was always singing, he ought to have more sense.You can't do as
you like nowadays you know!Easton--who was working at another job with Crass as his foreman--knew
that unless some more work came in he was likely to be one of those who
would have to go.As far as he could see it was only a week or two at
the most before everything would be finished up.But notwithstanding
the prospect of being out of work so soon he was far happier than he
had been for several months past, for he imagined he had discovered the
cause of Ruth's strange manner.This knowledge came to him on the night of the Beano.When he arrived
home he found that Ruth had already gone to bed: she had not been well,
and it was Mrs Linden's explanation of her illness that led Easton to
think that he had discovered the cause of the unhappiness of the last
few months.Now that he knew--as he thought--he blamed himself for not
having been more considerate and patient with her.At the same time he
was at a loss to understand why she had not told him about it herself.The only explanation he could think of was the one suggested by Mrs
Linden--that at such times women often behaved strangely.However that
might be, he was glad to think he knew the reason of it all, and he
resolved that he would be more gentle and forebearing with her.The place where he was working was practically finished.It was a
large house called 'The Refuge', very similar to 'The Cave', and during
the last week or two, it had become what they called a 'hospital'.That is, as the other jobs became finished the men were nearly all sent
to this one, so that there was quite a large crowd of them there.The
inside work was all finished--with the exception of the kitchen, which
was used as a mess room, and the scullery, which was the paint shop.Poor old Joe Philpot, whose
rheumatism had been very bad lately, was doing a very rough
job--painting the gable from a long ladder.But though there were plenty of younger men more suitable for this,
Philpot did not care to complain for fear Crass or Misery should think
he was not up to his work.At dinner time all the old hands assembled
in the kitchen, including Crass, Easton, Harlow, Bundy and Dick
Wantley, who still sat on a pail behind his usual moat.Philpot and Harlow were absent and everybody wondered what had become
of them.Several times during the morning they had been seen whispering together
and comparing scraps of paper, and various theories were put forward to
account for their disappearance.Most of the men thought they must
have heard something good about the probable winner of the Handicap and
had gone to put something on.Some others thought that perhaps they
had heard of another 'job' about to be started by some other firm and
had gone to inquire about it.'Looks to me as if they'll stand a very good chance of gettin' drowned
if they're gone very far,' remarked Easton, referring to the weather.It had been threatening to rain all the morning, and during the last
few minutes it had become so dark that Crass lit the gas, so that--as
he expressed it--they should be able to see the way to their mouths.Outside, the wind grew more boisterous every moment; the darkness
continued to increase, and presently there succeeded a torrential
downfall of rain, which beat fiercely against the windows, and poured
in torrents down the glass.No
more work could be done outside that day, and there was nothing left to
do inside.As they were paid by the hour, this would mean that they
would have to lose half a day's pay.'If it keeps on like this we won't be able to do no more work, and we
won't be able to go home either,' remarked Easton.'Well, we're all right 'ere, ain't we?'said the man behind the moat;
'there's a nice fire and plenty of heasy chairs.Wot the 'ell more do
you want?''If we only had a shove-ha'penny
table or a ring board, I reckon we should be able to enjoy ourselves
all right.'Philpot and Harlow were still absent, and the others again fell to
wondering where they could be.'I see old Joe up on 'is ladder only a few minutes before twelve,'
remarked Wantley.At this moment the two truants returned, looking very important.Philpot was armed with a hammer and carried a pair of steps, while
Harlow bore a large piece of wallpaper which the two of them proceeded
to tack on the wall, much to the amusement of the others, who read the
announcement opposite written in charcoal.Every day at meals since Barrington's unexpected outburst at the Beano
dinner, the men had been trying their best to 'kid him on' to make
another speech, but so far without success.If anything, he had been
even more silent and reserved than before, as if he felt some regret
that he had spoken as he had on that occasion.Crass and his disciples
attributed Barrington's manner to fear that he was going to get the
sack for his trouble and they agreed amongst themselves that it would
serve him bloody well right if 'e did get the push.When they had fixed the poster on the wall, Philpot stood the steps in
the corner of the room, with the back part facing outwards, and then,
everything being ready for the lecturer, the two sat down in their
accustomed places and began to eat their dinners, Harlow remarking that
they would have to buck up or they would be too late for the meeting;
and the rest of the crowd began to discuss the poster.'Wot the 'ell does PLO mean?''Plain Layer On,' answered Philpot modestly.''Ave you ever 'eard the Professor preach before?'inquired the man on
the pail, addressing Bundy.Imperial Bankquet Hall

'Only once, at the Beano,' replied that individual; 'an' that was once
too often!''Finest speaker I ever 'eard,' said the man on the pail with
enthusiasm.'I wouldn't miss this lecture for anything: this is one of
'is best subjects.I got 'ere about two hours before the doors was
opened, so as to be sure to get a seat.''Yes, it's a very good subject,' said Crass, with a sneer.'I believe
most of the Labour Members in Parliament is well up in it.''Seems to me as
if most of them knows something about it too.''The difference is,' said Owen, 'the working classes voluntarily pay to
keep the Labour Members, but whether they like it or not, they have to
keep the others.''The Labour members is sent to the 'Ouse of Commons,' said Harlow, 'and
paid their wages to do certain work for the benefit of the working
classes, just the same as we're sent 'ere and paid our wages by the
Bloke to paint this 'ouse.''Yes,' said Crass; 'but if we didn't do the work we're paid to do, we
should bloody soon get the sack.''I can't see how we've got to keep the other members,' said Slyme;
'they're mostly rich men, and they live on their own money.''And I should like to know where we should be
without 'em!It seems to me more like it
that they keeps us!Where
should we be if it wasn't for all the money they spend and the work
they 'as done?If the owner of this 'ouse 'adn't 'ad the money to
spend to 'ave it done up, most of us would 'ave bin out of work this
last six weeks, and starvin', the same as lots of others 'as been.''Oh yes, that's right enough,' agreed Bundy.Before any work can be done there's one thing
necessary, and that's money.It would be easy to find work for all the
unemployed if the local authorities could only raise the money.''Yes; that's quite true,' said Owen.'And that proves that money is
the cause of poverty, because poverty consists in being short of the
necessaries of life: the necessaries of life are all produced by labour
applied to the raw materials: the raw materials exist in abundance and
there are plenty of people able and willing to work; but under present
conditions no work can be done without money; and so we have the
spectacle of a great army of people compelled to stand idle and starve
by the side of the raw materials from which their labour could produce
abundance of all the things they need--they are rendered helpless by
the power of Money!Those who possess all the money say that the
necessaries of life shall not be produced except for their profit.'and you can't alter it,' said Crass, triumphantly.'It's always
been like it, and it always will be like it.''There's always been
rich and poor in the world, and there always will be.'Several others expressed their enthusiastic agreement with Crass's
opinion, and most of them appeared to be highly delighted to think that
the existing state of affairs could never be altered.'It hasn't always been like it, and it won't always be like it,' said
Owen.'The time will come, and it's not very far distant, when the
necessaries of life will be produced for use and not for profit.The
time is coming when it will no longer be possible for a few selfish
people to condemn thousands of men and women and little children to
live in misery and die of want.''Ah well, it won't be in your time, or mine either,' said Crass
gleefully, and most of the others laughed with imbecile satisfaction.'I've 'eard a 'ell of a lot about this 'ere Socialism,' remarked the
man behind the moat, 'but up to now I've never met nobody wot could
tell you plainly exactly wot it is.''Yes; that's what I should like to know too,' said Easton.'Socialism means, "What's yours is mine, and what's mine's me own,"'
observed Bundy, and during the laughter that greeted this definition
Slyme was heard to say that Socialism meant Materialism, Atheism and
Free Love, and if it were ever to come about it would degrade men and
women to the level of brute beasts.Harlow said Socialism was a
beautiful ideal, which he for one would be very glad to see realized,
and he was afraid it was altogether too good to be practical, because
human nature is too mean and selfish.Sawkins said that Socialism was
a lot of bloody rot, and Crass expressed the opinion--which he had
culled from the delectable columns of the Obscurer--that it meant
robbing the industrious for the benefit of the idle and thriftless.Philpot had by this time finished his bread and cheese, and, having
taken a final draught of tea, he rose to his feet, and crossing over to
the corner of the room, ascended the pulpit, being immediately greeted
with a tremendous outburst of hooting, howling and booing, which he
smilingly acknowledged by removing his cap from his bald head and
bowing repeatedly.When the storm of shrieks, yells, groans and
catcalls had in some degree subsided, and Philpot was able to make
himself heard, he addressed the meeting as follows:

'Gentlemen: First of all I beg to thank you very sincerely for the
magnificent and cordial reception you have given me on this occasion,
and I shall try to deserve your good opinion by opening the meeting as
briefly as possible.'Putting all jokes aside, I think we're all agreed about one thing, and
that is, that there's plenty of room for improvement in things in
general.As our other lecturer, Professor Owen, pointed
out in one of 'is lectures and as most of you 'ave read in the
newspapers, although British trade was never so good before as it is
now, there was never so much misery and poverty, and so many people out
of work, and so many small shopkeepers goin' up the spout as there is
at this partickiler time.Now, some people tells us as the way to put
everything right is to 'ave Free Trade and plenty of cheap food.Well,
we've got them all now, but the misery seems to go on all around us all
the same.Then there's other people tells us as the 'Friscal Policy'
is the thing to put everything right.("Hear, hear" from Crass and
several others.)And then there's another lot that ses that Socialism
is the only remedy.Well, we all know pretty well wot Free Trade and
Protection means, but most of us don't know exactly what Socialism
means; and I say as it's the dooty of every man to try and find out
which is the right thing to vote for, and when 'e's found it out, to do
wot 'e can to 'elp to bring it about.And that's the reason we've gorn
to the enormous expense of engaging Professor Barrington to come 'ere
this afternoon and tell us exactly what Socialism is.''As I 'ope you're all just as anxious to 'ear it as I am myself, I
will not stand between you and the lecturer no longer, but will now
call upon 'im to address you.'Philpot was loudly applauded as he descended from the pulpit, and in
response to the clamorous demands of the crowd, Barrington, who in the
meantime had yielded to Owen's entreaties that he would avail himself
of this opportunity of proclaiming the glad tidings of the good time
that is to be, got up on the steps in his turn.Harlow, desiring that everything should be done decently and in order,
had meantime arranged in front of the pulpit a carpenter's sawing
stool, and an empty pail with a small piece of board laid across it, to
serve as a seat and a table for the chairman.Over the table he draped
a large red handkerchief.At the right he placed a plumber's large
hammer; at the left, a battered and much-chipped jam-jar, full of tea.Philpot having taken his seat on the pail at this table and announced
his intention of bashing out with the hammer the brains of any
individual who ventured to disturb the meeting, Barrington commenced:

'Mr Chairman and Gentlemen.For the sake of clearness, and in order to
avoid confusing one subject with another, I have decided to divide the
oration into two parts.First, I will try to explain as well as I am
able what Socialism is.I will try to describe to you the plan or
system upon which the Co-operative Commonwealth of the future will be
organized; and, secondly, I will try to tell you how it can be brought
about.But before proceeding with the first part of the subject, I
would like to refer very slightly to the widespread delusion that
Socialism is impossible because it means a complete change from an
order of things which has always existed.We constantly hear it said
that because there have always been rich and poor in the world, there
always must be.I want to point out to you first of all, that it is
not true that even in its essential features, the present system has
existed from all time; it is not true that there have always been rich
and poor in the world, in the sense that we understand riches and
poverty today.'These statements are lies that have been invented for the purpose of
creating in us a feeling of resignation to the evils of our condition.They are lies which have been fostered by those who imagine that it is
to their interest that we should be content to see our children
condemned to the same poverty and degradation that we have endured
ourselves.I do not propose--because there is not time, although it is really part
of my subject--to go back to the beginnings of history, and describe in
detail the different systems of social organization which evolved from
and superseded each other at different periods, but it is necessary to
remind you that the changes that have taken place in the past have been
even greater than the change proposed by Socialists today.The change
from savagery and cannibalism when men used to devour the captives they
took in war--to the beginning of chattel slavery, when the tribes or
clans into which mankind were divided--whose social organization was a
kind of Communism, all the individuals belonging to the tribe being
practically social equals, members of one great family--found it more
profitable to keep their captives as slaves than to eat them.The
change from the primitive Communism of the tribes, into the more
individualistic organization of the nations, and the development of
private ownership of the land and slaves and means of subsistence.The
change from chattel slavery into Feudalism; and the change from
Feudalism into the earlier form of Capitalism; and the equally great
change from what might be called the individualistic capitalism which
displaced Feudalism, to the system of Co-operative Capitalism and Wage
Slavery of today.''I believe you must 'ave swollered a bloody dictionary,' exclaimed the
man behind the moat.'Keep horder,' shouted Philpot, fiercely, striking the table with the
hammer, and there were loud shouts of 'Chair' and 'Chuck 'im out,' from
several quarters.When order was restored, the lecturer proceeded:

'So it is not true that practically the same state of affairs as we
have today has always existed.It is not true that anything like the
poverty that prevails at present existed at any previous period of the
world's history.When the workers were the property of their masters,
it was to their owners' interest to see that they were properly clothed
and fed; they were not allowed to be idle, and they were not allowed to
starve.Under Feudalism also, although there were certain intolerable
circumstances, the position of the workers was, economically,
infinitely better than it is today.The worker was in subjection to
his Lord, but in return his lord had certain responsibilities and
duties to perform, and there was a large measure of community of
interest between them.'I do not intend to dwell upon this pout at length, but in support of
what I have said I will quote as nearly as I can from memory the words
of the historian Froude.'"I do not believe," says Mr Froude, "that the condition of the people
in Mediaeval Europe was as miserable as is pretended.I do not believe
that the distribution of the necessaries of life was as unequal as it
is at present.If the tenant lived hard, the lord had little luxury.Earls and countesses breakfasted at five in the morning, on salt beef
and herring, a slice of bread and a draught of ale from a blackjack.Lords and servants dined in the same hall and shared the same meal."'When we arrive at the system that displaced Feudalism, we find that
the condition of the workers was better in every way than it is at
present.The instruments of production--the primitive machinery and
the tools necessary for the creation of wealth--belonged to the skilled
workers who used them, and the things they produced were also the
property of those who made them.'In those days a master painter, a master shoemaker, a master saddler,
or any other master tradesmen, was really a skilled artisan working on
his own account.He usually had one or two apprentices, who were
socially his equals, eating at the same table and associating with the
other members of his family.It was quite a common occurrence for the
apprentice--after he had attained proficiency in his work--to marry his
master's daughter and succeed to his master's business.In those days
to be a "master" tradesman meant to be master of the trade, not merely
of some underpaid drudges in one's employment.The apprentices were
there to master the trade, qualifying themselves to become master
workers themselves; not mere sweaters and exploiters of the labour of
others, but useful members of society.In those days, because there
was no labour-saving machinery the community was dependent for its
existence on the productions of hand labour.Consequently the majority
of the people were employed in some kind of productive work, and the
workers were honoured and respected citizens, living in comfort on the
fruits of their labour.They were not rich as we understand wealth
now, but they did not starve and they were not regarded with contempt,
as are their successors of today.'The next great change came with the introduction of steam machinery.That power came to the aid of mankind in their struggle for existence,
enabling them to create easily and in abundance those things of which
they had previously been able to produce only a bare sufficiency.A
wonderful power--equalling and surpassing the marvels that were
imagined by the writers of fairy tales and Eastern stories--a power so
vast--so marvellous, that it is difficult to find words to convey
anything like an adequate conception of it.'We all remember the story, in The Arabian Nights, of Aladdin, who in
his poverty became possessed of the Wonderful Lamp and--he was poor no
longer.He merely had to rub the Lamp--the Genie appeared, and at
Aladdin's command he produced an abundance of everything that the youth
could ask or dream of.With the discovery of steam machinery, mankind
became possessed of a similar power to that imagined by the Eastern
writer.At the command of its masters the Wonderful Lamp of Machinery
produces an enormous, overwhelming, stupendous abundance and
superfluity of every material thing necessary for human existence and
happiness.With less labour than was formerly required to cultivate
acres, we can now cultivate miles of land.In response to human
industry, aided by science and machinery, the fruitful earth teems with
such lavish abundance as was never known or deemed possible before.If
you go into the different factories and workshops you will see
prodigious quantities of commodities of every kind pouring out of the
wonderful machinery, literally like water from a tap.'One would naturally and reasonably suppose that the discovery or
invention of such an aid to human industry would result in increased
happiness and comfort for every one; but as you all know, the reverse
is the case; and the reason of that extraordinary result, is the reason
of all the poverty and unhappiness that we see around us and endure
today--it is simply because--the machinery became the property of a
comparatively few individuals and private companies, who use it not for
the benefit of the community but to create profits for themselves.'As this labour-saving machinery became more extensively used, the
prosperous class of skilled workers gradually disappeared.Some of the
wealthier of them became distributers instead of producers of wealth;
that is to say, they became shopkeepers, retailing the commodities that
were produced for the most part by machinery.But the majority of them
in course of time degenerated into a class of mere wage earners, having
no property in the machines they used, and no property in the things
they made.'They sold their labour for so much per hour, and when they could not
find any employer to buy it from them, they were reduced to destitution.'Whilst the unemployed workers were starving and those in employment
not much better off, the individuals and private companies who owned
the machinery accumulated fortunes; but their profits were diminished
and their working expenses increased by what led to the latest great
change in the organization of the production of the necessaries of
life--the formation of the Limited Companies and the Trusts; the
decision of the private companies to combine and co-operate with each
other in order to increase their profits and decrease their working
expenses.The results of these combines have been--an increase in the
quantities of the things produced: a decrease in the number of wage
earners employed--and enormously increased profits for the shareholders.'But it is not only the wage-earning class that is being hurt; for
while they are being annihilated by the machinery and the efficient
organization of industry by the trusts that control and are beginning
to monopolize production, the shopkeeping classes are also being slowly
but surely crushed out of existence by the huge companies that are able
by the greater magnitude of their operations to buy and sell more
cheaply than the small traders.'The consequence of all this is that the majority of the people are in
a condition of more or less abject poverty--living from hand to mouth.It is an admitted fact that about thirteen millions of our people are
always on the verge of starvation.The significant results of this
poverty face us on every side.The alarming and persistent increase of
insanity.The large number of would-be recruits for the army who have
to be rejected because they are physically unfit; and the shameful
condition of the children of the poor.More than one-third of the
children of the working classes in London have some sort of mental or
physical defect; defects in development; defects of eyesight; abnormal
nervousness; rickets, and mental dullness.The difference in height
and weight and general condition of the children in poor schools and
the children of the so-called better classes, constitutes a crime that
calls aloud to Heaven for vengeance upon those who are responsible for
it.'It is childish to imagine that any measure of Tariff Reform or
Political Reform such as a paltry tax on foreign-made goods or
abolishing the House of Lords, or disestablishing the Church--or
miserable Old Age Pensions, or a contemptible tax on land, can deal
with such a state of affairs as this.They have no House of Lords in
America or France, and yet their condition is not materially different
from ours.You may be deceived into thinking that such measures as
those are great things.You may fight for them and vote for them, but
after you have got them you will find that they will make no
appreciable improvement in your condition.You will still have to
slave and drudge to gain a bare sufficiency of the necessaries of life.You will still have to eat the same kind of food and wear the same kind
of clothes and boots as now.Your masters will still have you in their
power to insult and sweat and drive.Your general condition will be
just the same as at present because such measures as those are not
remedies but red herrings, intended by those who trail them to draw us
away from the only remedy, which is to be found only in the Public
Ownership of the Machinery, and the National Organization of Industry
for the production and distribution of the necessaries of life, not for
the profit of a few but for the benefit of all!'That is the next great change; not merely desirable, but imperatively
necessary and inevitable!'It is not a wild dream of Superhuman Unselfishness.No one will be
asked to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others or to love his
neighbours better than himself as is the case under the present system,
which demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour
and live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few.There is no such
principle of Philanthropy in Socialism, which simply means that even as
all industries are now owned by shareholders, and organized and
directed by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so
shall they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole
people--and they shall be organized and directed by committees and
officers elected by the community.'Under existing circumstances the community is exposed to the danger of
being invaded and robbed and massacred by some foreign power.Therefore
the community has organized and owns and controls an Army and Navy to
protect it from that danger.Under existing circumstances the
community is menaced by another equally great danger--the people are
mentally and physically degenerating from lack of proper food and
clothing.Socialists say that the community should undertake and
organize the business of producing and distributing all these things;
that the State should be the only employer of labour and should own all
the factories, mills, mines, farms, railways, fishing fleets, sheep
farms, poultry farms and cattle ranches.'Under existing circumstances the community is degenerating mentally
and physically because the majority cannot afford to have decent houses
to live in.Socialists say that the community should take in hand the
business of providing proper houses for all its members, that the State
should be the only landlord, that all the land and all the houses
should belong to the whole people...

'We must do this if we are to keep our old place in the van of human
progress.A nation of ignorant, unintelligent, half-starved,
broken-spirited degenerates cannot hope to lead humanity in its
never-ceasing march onward to the conquest of the future.'Vain, mightiest fleet of iron framed;
        Vain the all-shattering guns
        Unless proud England keep, untamed,
        The stout hearts of her sons.'All the evils that I have referred to are only symptoms of the one
disease that is sapping the moral, mental and physical life of the
nation, and all attempts to cure these symptoms are foredoomed to
failure, simply because they are the symptoms and not the disease.All
the talk of Temperance, and the attempts to compel temperance, are
foredoomed to failure, because drunkenness is a symptom, and not the
disease.Every year millions of pounds
worth of wealth are produced by her people, only to be stolen from them
by means of the Money Trick by the capitalist and official class.Her
industrious sons and daughters, who are nearly all total abstainers,
live in abject poverty, and their misery is not caused by laziness or
want of thrift, or by Intemperance.They are poor for the same reason
that we are poor--Because we are Robbed.'The hundreds of thousands of pounds that are yearly wasted in
well-meant but useless charity accomplish no lasting good, because
while charity soothes the symptoms it ignores the disease, which
is--the PRIVATE OWNERSHIP of the means of producing the necessaries of
life, and the restriction of production, by a few selfish individuals
for their own profit.And for that disease there is no other remedy
than the one I have told you of--the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP and cultivation
of the land, the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF the mines, railways, canals,
ships, factories and all the other means of production, and the
establishment of an Industrial Civil Service--a National Army of
Industry--for the purpose of producing the necessaries, comforts and
refinements of life in that abundance which has been made possible by
science and machinery--for the use and benefit of THE WHOLE OF THE
PEOPLE.''Yes: and where's the money to come from for all this?'shouted Crass,
fiercely.'Hear, hear,' cried the man behind the moat.'There's no money difficulty about it,' replied Barrington.'We can
easily find all the money we shall need.''Of course,' said Slyme, who had been reading the Daily Ananias,
'there's all the money in the Post Office Savings Bank.The Socialists
could steal that for a start; and as for the mines and land and
factories, they can all be took from the owners by force.''There will be no need for force and no need to steal anything from
anybody.''And there's another thing I objects to,' said Crass.'And that's all
this 'ere talk about hignorance: wot about all the money wots spent
every year for edication?''You should rather say--"What about all the money that's wasted every
year on education?"What can be more brutal and senseless than trying
to "educate" a poor little, hungry, ill-clad child?Such so-called
"instruction" is like the seed in the parable of the Sower, which fell
on stony ground and withered away because it had no depth of earth; and
even in those cases where it does take root and grow, it becomes like
the seed that fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it,
and it bore no fruit.'The majority of us forget in a year or two all that we learnt at
school because the conditions of our lives are such as to destroy all
inclination for culture or refinement.We must see that the children
are properly clothed and fed and that they are not made to get up in
the middle of the night to go to work for several hours before they go
to school.We must make it illegal for any greedy, heartless
profit-hunter to hire them and make them labour for several hours in
the evening after school, or all day and till nearly midnight on
Saturday.We must first see that our children are cared for, as well
as the children of savage races, before we can expect a proper return
for the money that we spend on education.''I don't mind admitting that this 'ere scheme of national ownership and
industries is all right if it could only be done,' said Harlow, 'but at
present, all the land, railways and factories, belongs to private
capitalists; they can't be bought without money, and you say you ain't
goin' to take 'em away by force, so I should like to know how the
bloody 'ell you are goin' to get 'em?''We certainly don't propose to buy them with money, for the simple
reason that there is not sufficient money in existence to pay for them.'If all the gold and silver money in the World were gathered together
into one heap, it would scarcely be sufficient to buy all the private
property in England.The people who own all these things now never
really paid for them with money--they obtained possession of them by
means of the "Money Trick" which Owen explained to us some time ago.''They obtained possession of them by usin' their brain,' said Crass.'They tell us themselves that that is
how they got them away from us; they call their profits the "wages of
intelligence".Whilst we have been working, they have been using their
intelligence in order to obtain possession of the things we have
created.The time has now arrived for us to use our intelligence in
order to get back the things they have robbed us of, aid to prevent
them from robbing us any more.As for how it is to be done, we might
copy the methods that they have found so successful.''Oh, then you DO mean to rob them after all,' cried Slyme,
triumphantly.'If it's true that they robbed the workers, and if we're
to adopt the same method then we'll be robbers too!''When a thief is caught having in his possession the property of others
it is not robbery to take the things away from him and to restore them
to their rightful owners,' retorted Barrington.'I can't allow this 'ere disorder to go on no longer,' shouted Philpot,
banging the table with the plumber's hammer as several men began
talking at the same time.'There will be plenty of tuneropperty for questions and opposition at
the hend of the horation, when the pulpit will be throwed open to
anyone as likes to debate the question.I now calls upon the professor
to proceed with the second part of the horation: and anyone wot
interrupts will get a lick under the ear-'ole with this'--waving the
hammer--'and the body will be chucked out of the bloody winder.'It was still raining heavily,
so they thought they might as well pass the time listening to
Barrington as in any other way.'A large part of the land may be got back in the same way as it was
taken from us.The ancestors of the present holders obtained
possession of it by simply passing Acts of Enclosure: the nation should
regain possession of those lands by passing Acts of Resumption.And
with regard to the other land, the present holders should be allowed to
retain possession of it during their lives and then it should revert to
the State, to be used for the benefit of all.Britain should belong to
the British people, not to a few selfish individuals.As for the
railways, they have already been nationalized in some other countries,
and what other countries can do we can do also.In New Zealand,
Australia, South Africa, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and some other
countries some of the railways are already the property of the State.As for the method by which we can obtain possession of them, the
difficulty is not to discover a method, but rather to decide which of
many methods we shall adopt.One method would be to simply pass an Act
declaring that as it was contrary to the public interest that they
should be owned by private individuals, the railways would henceforth
be the property of the nation.All railways servants, managers and
officials would continue in their employment; the only difference being
that they would now be in the employ of the State.As to the
shareholders--'

'They could all be knocked on the 'ead, I suppose,' interrupted Crass.'Or go to the workhouse,' said Slyme.'Or to 'ell,' suggested the man behind the moat.

'--The State would continue to pay to the shareholders the same
dividends they had received on an average for, say, the previous three
years.These payments would be continued to the present shareholders
for life, or the payments might be limited to a stated number of years
and the shares would be made non-transferable, like the railway tickets
of today.As for the factories, shops, and other means of production
and distribution, the State must adopt the same methods of doing
business as the present owners.I mean that even as the big Trusts and
companies are crushing--by competition--the individual workers and
small traders, so the State should crush the trusts by competition.It
is surely justifiable for the State to do for the benefit of the whole
people that which the capitalists are already doing for the profit of a
few shareholders.The first step in this direction will be the
establishment of Retail Stores for the purpose of supplying all
national and municipal employees with the necessaries of life at the
lowest possible prices.At first the Administration will purchase
these things from the private manufacturers, in such large quantities
that it will be able to obtain them at the very cheapest rate, and as
there will be no heavy rents to pay for showy shops, and no advertising
expenses, and as the object of the Administration will be not to make
profit, but to supply its workmen and officials with goods at the
lowest price, they will be able to sell them much cheaper than the
profit-making private stores.'The National Service Retail Stores will be for the benefit of only
those in the public service; and gold, silver or copper money will not
be accepted in payment for the things sold.At first, all public
servants will continue to be paid in metal money, but those who desire
it will be paid all or part of their wages in paper money of the same
nominal value, which will be accepted in payment for their purchases at
the National Stores and at the National Hotels, Restaurants and other
places which will be established for the convenience of those in the
State service.It will be made of
a special very strong paper, and will be of all value, from a penny to
a pound.'As the National Service Stores will sell practically everything that
could be obtained elsewhere, and as twenty shillings in paper money
will be able to purchase much more at the stores than twenty shillings
of metal money would purchase anywhere else, it will not be long before
nearly all public servants will prefer to be paid in paper money.As
far as paying the salaries and wages of most of its officials and
workmen is concerned, the Administration will not then have any need of
metal money.But it will require metal money to pay the private
manufacturers who supply the goods sold in the National Stores.But--all these things are made by labour; so in order to avoid having
to pay metal money for them, the State will now commence to employ
productive labour.All the public land suitable for the purpose will
be put into cultivation and State factories will be established for
manufacturing food, boots, clothing, furniture and all other
necessaries and comforts of life.All those who are out of employment
and willing to work, will be given employment on these farms and in
these factories.In order that the men employed shall not have to work
unpleasantly hard, and that their hours of labour may be as short as
possible--at first, say, eight hours per day--and also to make sure
that the greatest possible quantity of everything shall be produced,
these factories and farms will be equipped with the most up-to-date and
efficient labour-saving machinery.The people employed in the farms
and factories will be paid with paper money... The commodities they
produce will go to replenish the stocks of the National Service Stores,
where the workers will be able to purchase with their paper money
everything they need.'As we shall employ the greatest possible number of labour-saving
machines, and adopt the most scientific methods in our farms and
factories, the quantities of goods we shall be able to produce will be
so enormous that we shall be able to pay our workers very high
wages--in paper money--and we shall be able to sell our produce so
cheaply, that all public servants will be able to enjoy abundance of
everything.'When the workers who are being exploited and sweated by the private
capitalists realize how much worse off they are than the workers in the
employ of the State, they will come and ask to be allowed to work for
the State, and also, for paper money.That will mean that the State
Army of Productive Workers will be continually increasing in numbers.More State factories will be built, more land will be put into
cultivation.Men will be given employment making bricks, woodwork,
paints, glass, wallpapers and all kinds of building materials and
others will be set to work building--on State land--beautiful houses,
which will be let to those employed in the service of the State.The
rent will be paid with paper money.'State fishing fleets will be established and the quantities of
commodities of all kinds produced will be so great that the State
employees and officials will not be able to use it all.With their
paper money they will be able to buy enough and more than enough to
satisfy all their needs abundantly, but there will still be a great and
continuously increasing surplus stock in the possession of the State.'The Socialist Administration will now acquire or build fleets of steam
trading vessels, which will of course be manned and officered by State
employees--the same as the Royal Navy is now.These fleets of National
trading vessels will carry the surplus stocks I have mentioned, to
foreign countries, and will there sell or exchange them for some of the
products of those countries, things that we do not produce ourselves.These things will be brought to England and sold at the National
Service Stores, at the lowest possible price, for paper money, to those
in the service of the State.This of course will only have the effect
of introducing greater variety into the stocks--it will not diminish
the surplus: and as there would be no sense in continuing to produce
more of these things than necessary, it would then be the duty of the
Administration to curtail or restrict production of the necessaries of
life.This could be done by reducing the hours of the workers without
reducing their wages so as to enable them to continue to purchase as
much as before.'Another way of preventing over production of mere necessaries and
comforts will be to employ a large number of workers producing the
refinements and pleasures of life, more artistic houses, furniture,
pictures, musical instruments and so forth.'In the centre of every district a large Institute or pleasure house
could be erected, containing a magnificently appointed and decorated
theatre; Concert Hall, Lecture Hall, Gymnasium, Billiard Rooms, Reading
Rooms, Refreshment Rooms, and so on.A detachment of the Industrial
Army would be employed as actors, artistes, musicians, singers and
entertainers.In fact everyone that could be spared from the most
important work of all--that of producing the necessaries of life--would
be employed in creating pleasure, culture, and education.All these
people--like the other branches of the public service--would be paid
with paper money, and with it all of them would be able to purchase
abundance of all those things which constitute civilization.'Meanwhile, as a result of all this, the kind-hearted private employers
and capitalists would find that no one would come and work for them to
be driven and bullied and sweated for a miserable trifle of metal money
that is scarcely enough to purchase sufficient of the necessaries of
life to keep body and soul together.'These kind-hearted capitalists will protest against what they will
call the unfair competition of State industry, and some of them may
threaten to leave the country and take their capital with them...  As
most of these persons are too lazy to work, and as we will not need
their money, we shall be very glad to see them go.But with regard to
their real capital--their factories, farms, mines or machinery--that
will be a different matter...  To allow these things to remain idle and
unproductive would constitute an injury to the community.So a law
will be passed, declaring that all land not cultivated by the owner, or
any factory shut down for more than a specified time, will be taken
possession of by the State and worked for the benefit of the
community...  Fair compensation will be paid in paper money to the
former owners, who will be granted an income or pension of so much a
year either for life or for a stated period according to circumstances
and the ages of the persons concerned.'As for the private traders, the wholesale and retail dealers in the
things produced by labour, they will be forced by the State competition
to close down their shops and warehouses--first, because they will not
be able to replenish their stocks; and, secondly, because even if they
were able to do so, they would not be able to sell them.This will
throw out of work a great host of people who are at present engaged in
useless occupations; the managers and assistants in the shops of which
we now see half a dozen of the same sort in a single street; the
thousands of men and women who are slaving away their lives producing
advertisements, for, in most cases, a miserable pittance of metal
money, with which many of them are unable to procure sufficient of the
necessaries of life to secure them from starvation.'The masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and all the others engaged
in maintaining these unnecessary stores and shops will all be thrown
out of employment, but all of them who are willing to work will be
welcomed by the State and will be at once employed helping either to
produce or distribute the necessaries and comforts of life.They will
have to work fewer hours than before...  They will not have to work so
hard--for there will be no need to drive or bully, because there will
be plenty of people to do the work, and most of it will be done by
machinery--and with their paper money they will be able to buy
abundance of the things they help to produce.The shops and stores
where these people were formerly employed will be acquired by the
State, which will pay the former owners fair compensation in the same
manner as to the factory owners.Some of the buildings will be
utilized by the State as National Service Stores, others transformed
into factories and others will be pulled down to make room for
dwellings, or public buildings...  It will be the duty of the
Government to build a sufficient number of houses to accommodate the
families of all those in its employment, and as a consequence of this
and because of the general disorganization and decay of what is now
called "business", all other house property of all kinds will rapidly
depreciate in value.The slums and the wretched dwellings now occupied
by the working classes--the miserable, uncomfortable, jerry-built
"villas" occupied by the lower middle classes and by "business" people,
will be left empty and valueless upon the hands of their rack renting
landlords, who will very soon voluntarily offer to hand them and the
ground they stand upon to the state on the same terms as those accorded
to the other property owners, namely--in return for a pension.Some of
these people will be content to live in idleness on the income allowed
them for life as compensation by the State: others will devote
themselves to art or science and some others will offer their services
to the community as managers and superintendents, and the State will
always be glad to employ all those who are willing to help in the Great
Work of production and distribution.'By this time the nation will be the sole employer of labour, and as no
one will be able to procure the necessaries of life without paper
money, and as the only way to obtain this will be working, it will mean
that every mentally and physically capable person in the community will
be helping in the great work of PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION.We shall
not need as at present, to maintain a police force to protect the
property of the idle rich from the starving wretches whom they have
robbed.There will be no unemployed and no overlapping of labour,
which will be organized and concentrated for the accomplishment of the
only rational object--the creation of the things we require...  For
every one labour-saving machine in use today, we will, if necessary,
employ a thousand machines!and consequently there will be produced
such a stupendous, enormous, prodigious, overwhelming abundance of
everything that soon the Community will be faced once more with the
serious problem of OVER-PRODUCTION.'To deal with this, it will be necessary to reduce the hours of our
workers to four or five hours a day...  All young people will be
allowed to continue at public schools and universities and will not be
required to take any part in the work or the nation until they are
twenty-one years of age.At the age of forty-five, everyone will be
allowed to retire from the State service on full pay...  All these will
be able to spend the rest of their days according to their own
inclinations; some will settle down quietly at home, and amuse
themselves in the same ways as people of wealth and leisure do at the
present day--with some hobby, or by taking part in the organization of
social functions, such as balls, parties, entertainments, the
organization of Public Games and Athletic Tournaments, Races and all
kinds of sports.'Some will prefer to continue in the service of the State.Actors,
artists, sculptors, musicians and others will go on working for their
own pleasure and honour...  Some will devote their leisure to science,
art, or literature.Others will prefer to travel on the State
steamships to different parts of the world to see for themselves all
those things of which most of us have now but a dim and vague
conception.The wonders of India and Egypt, the glories of Rome, the
artistic treasures of the continent and the sublime scenery of other
lands.'Thus--for the first time in the history of humanity--the benefits and
pleasures conferred upon mankind by science and civilization will be
enjoyed equally by all, upon the one condition, that they shall do
their share of the work, that is necessary in order to, make all these
things possible.'These are the principles upon which the CO-OPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH of
the future will be organized.The State in which no one will be
distinguished or honoured above his fellows except for Virtue or
Talent.Where no man will find his profit in another's loss, and we
shall no longer be masters and servants, but brothers, free men, and
friends.Where there will be no weary, broken men and women passing
their joyless lives in toil and want, and no little children crying
because they are hungry or cold.'A State wherein it will be possible to put into practice the teachings
of Him whom so many now pretend to follow.A society which shall have
justice and co-operation for its foundation, and International
Brotherhood and love for its law.but
        What are the deeds of today,
        In the days of the years we dwell in,
        That wear our lives away?Why, then, and for what we are waiting?There are but three words to speak
        "We will it," and what is the foreman
        but the dream strong wakened and weak?'Oh, why and for what are we waiting, while
        our brothers droop and die?And on every wind of the heavens, a
        wasted life goes by.'How long shall they reproach us, where
        crowd on crowd they dwell
        Poor ghosts of the wicked city,
        gold crushed, hungry hell?'Through squalid life they laboured in
        sordid grief they died
        Those sons of a mighty mother, those
        props of England's pride.They are gone, there is none can undo
        it, nor save our souls from the curse,
        But many a million cometh, and shall
        they be better or worse?'It is We must answer and hasten and open wide the door,
        For the rich man's hurrying terror, and the slow foot hope of
        the poor,
        Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched and their unlearned
        discontent,
        We must give it voice and wisdom, till the waiting tide be
        spent
        Come then since all things call us, the living and the dead,
        And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed.'As Barrington descended from the Pulpit and walked back to his
accustomed seat, a loud shout of applause burst from a few men in the
crowd, who stood up and waved their caps and cheered again and again.When order was restored, Philpot rose and addressed the meeting:

'Is there any gentleman wot would like to ask the Speaker a question?'No one spoke and the Chairman again put the question without obtaining
any response, but at length one of the new hands who had been 'taken
on' about a week previously to replace another painter who had been
sacked for being too slow--stood up and said there was one point that
he would like a little more information about.This man had two
patches on the seat of his trousers, which were also very much frayed
and ragged at the bottoms of the legs: the lining of his coat was all
in rags, as were also the bottoms of the sleeves; his boots were old
and had been many times mended and patched; the sole of one of them had
begun to separate from the upper and he had sewn these parts together
with a few stitches of copper wire.He had been out of employment for
several weeks and it was evident from the pinched expression of his
still haggard face that during that time he had not had sufficient to
eat.This man was not a drunkard, neither was he one of those
semi-mythical persons who are too lazy to work.He was married and had
several children.One of them, a boy of fourteen years old, earned
five shillings a week as a light porter at a Grocer's.Being a householder the man had a vote, but he had never hitherto taken
much interest in what he called 'politics'.In his opinion, those
matters were not for the likes of him.He believed in leaving such
difficult subjects to be dealt with by his betters.In his present
unhappy condition he was a walking testimonial to the wisdom and virtue
and benevolence of those same 'betters' who have hitherto managed the
affairs of the world with results so very satisfactory for themselves.'I should like to ask the speaker,' he said,'supposin' all this that
'e talks about is done--what's to become of the King, and the Royal
Family, and all the Big Pots?'''Ear, 'ear,' cried Crass, eagerly--and Ned Dawson and the man behind
the moat both said that that was what they would like to know, too.'I am much more concerned about what is to become of ourselves if these
things are not done,' replied Barrington.'I think we should try to
cultivate a little more respect of our own families and to concern
ourselves a little less about "Royal" Families.I fail to see any
reason why we should worry ourselves about those people; they're all
right--they have all they need, and as far as I am aware, nobody wishes
to harm them and they are well able to look after themselves.They will
fare the same as the other rich people.''I should like to ask,' said Harlow, 'wot's to become of all the gold
and silver and copper money?Wouldn't it be of no use at all?''It would be of far more use under Socialism than it is at present.The
State would of course become possessed of a large quantity of it in the
early stages of the development of the Socialist system, because--at
first--while the State would be paying all its officers and productive
workers in paper, the rest of the community--those not in State
employ--would be paying their taxes in gold as at present.All
travellers on the State railways--other than State employees--would pay
their fares in metal money, and gold and silver would pour into the
State Treasury from many other sources.The State would receive gold
and silver and--for the most part--pay out paper.By the time the
system of State employment was fully established, gold and silver would
only be of value as metal and the State would purchase it from whoever
possessed and wished to sell it--at so much per pound as raw material:
instead of hiding it away in the vaults of banks, or locking it up in
iron safes, we shall make use of it.Some of the gold will be
manufactured into articles of jewellery, to be sold for paper money and
worn by the sweethearts and wives and daughters of the workers; some of
it will be beaten out into gold leaf to be used in the decoration of
the houses of the citizens and of public buildings.As for the silver,
it will be made into various articles of utility for domestic use.The
workers will not then, as now, have to eat their food with poisonous
lead or brass spoons and forks, we shall have these things of silver
and if there is not enough silver we shall probably have a
non-poisonous alloy of that metal.''As far as I can make out,' said Harlow, 'the paper money will be just
as valuable as gold and silver is now.Well, wot's to prevent artful
dodgers like old Misery and Rushton saving it up and buying and selling
things with it, and so livin' without work?''Of course,' said Crass, scornfully.'That's a very simple matter; any man who lives without doing any
useful work is living on the labour of others, he is robbing others of
part of the result of their labour.The object of Socialism is to stop
this robbery, to make it impossible.So no one will be able to hoard
up or accumulate the paper money because it will be dated, and will
become worthless if it is not spent within a certain time after its
issue.As for buying and selling for profit--from whom would they buy?'Well, they might buy some of the things the workers didn't want, for
less than the workers paid for them, and then they could sell 'em
again.''They'd have to sell them for less than the price charged at the
National Stores, and if you think about it a little you'll see that it
would not be very profitable.It would be with the object of
preventing any attempts at private trading that the Administration
would refuse to pay compensation to private owners in a lump sum.All
such compensations would be paid, as I said, in the form of a pension
of so much per year.'Another very effective way to prevent private trading would be to make
it a criminal offence against the well-being of the community.At
present many forms of business are illegal unless you take out a
licence; under Socialism no one would be allowed to trade without a
licence, and no licences would be issued.''Wouldn't a man be allowed to save up his money if he wanted to,
demanded Slyme with indignation.'There will be nothing to prevent a man going without some of the
things he might have if he is foolish enough to do so, but he would
never be able to save up enough to avoid doing his share of useful
service.Besides, what need would there be for anyone to save?One's
old age would be provided for.If one was ill the State hospitals and Medical Service would be free.As for one's children, they would attend the State Free Schools and
Colleges and when of age they would enter the State Service, their
futures provided for.Can you tell us why anyone would need or wish to
save?''While we are speaking of money,' added Barrington, 'I should like to
remind you that even under the present system there are many things
which cost money to maintain, that we enjoy without having to pay for
directly.The public roads and pavements cost money to make and
maintain and light.Under a Socialist Administration this principle will
be extended--in addition to the free services we enjoy now we shall
then maintain the trains and railways for the use of the public, free.And as time goes on, this method of doing business will be adopted in
many other directions.''I've read somewhere,' said Harlow, 'that whenever a Government in any
country has started issuing paper money it has always led to
bankruptcy.How do you know that the same thing would not happen under
a Socialist Administration?'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.'I was just goin' to say the same thing.''If the Government of a country began to issue large amounts of paper
money under the present system,' Barrington replied, 'it would
inevitably lead to bankruptcy, for the simple reason that paper money
under the present system--bank-notes, bank drafts, postal orders,
cheques or any other form--is merely a printed promise to pay the
amount--in gold or silver--on demand or at a certain date.Under the
present system if a Government issues more paper money than it
possesses gold and silver to redeem, it is of course bankrupt.But the
paper money that will be issued under a Socialist Administration will
not be a promise to pay in gold or silver on demand or at any time.It
will be a promise to supply commodities to the amount specified on the
note, and as there could be no dearth of those things there could be no
possibility of bankruptcy.''I should like to know who's goin' to appoint the hofficers of this
'ere hindustrial harmy,' said the man on the pail.'We don't want to
be bullied and chivied and chased about by a lot of sergeants and
corporals like a lot of soldiers, you know.'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.Someone's got
to be in charge of the work.''We don't have to put up with any bullying or chivying or chasing now,
do we?''So of course we could not have anything of
that sort under Socialism.We could not put up with it at all!Even
if it were only for four or five hours a day.Under the present system
we have no voice in appointing our masters and overseers and
foremen--we have no choice as to what master we shall work under.If
our masters do not treat us fairly we have no remedy against them.Under Socialism it will be different; the workers will be part of the
community; the officers or managers and foremen will be the servants of
the community, and if any one of these men were to abuse his position
he could be promptly removed.As for the details of the organization
of the Industrial Army, the difficulty is, again, not so much to devise
a way, but to decide which of many ways would be the best, and the
perfect way will probably be developed only after experiment and
experience.The one thing we have to hold fast to is the fundamental
principle of State employment or National service.The national organization of industry under
democratic control.One way of arranging this business would be for
the community to elect a Parliament in much the same way as is done at
present.The only persons eligible for election to be veterans of the
industrial Army, men and women who had put in their twenty-five years
of service.'This Administrative Body would have control of the different State
Departments.There would be a Department of Agriculture, a Department
of Railways and so on, each with its minister and staff.'All these Members of Parliament would be the relatives--in some cases
the mothers and fathers of those in the Industrial Service, and they
would be relied upon to see that the conditions of that service were
the best possible.'As for the different branches of the State Service, they could be
organized on somewhat the same lines as the different branches of the
Public Service are now--like the Navy, the Post Office and as the State
Railways in some other countries, or as are the different branches of
the Military Army, with the difference that all promotions will be from
the ranks, by examinations, and by merit only.As every recruit will
have had the same class of education they will all have absolute
equality of opportunity and the men who would attain to positions of
authority would be the best men, and not as at present, the worst.''Under the present system, the men who become masters and employers
succeed because they are cunning and selfish, not because they
understand or are capable of doing the work out of which they make
their money.Most of the employers in the building trade for instance
would be incapable of doing any skilled work.Very few of them would
be worth their salt as journeymen.The only work they do is to scheme
to reap the benefit of the labour of others.'The men who now become managers and foremen are selected not because
of their ability as craftsmen, but because they are good slave-drivers
and useful producers of profit for their employers.''How are you goin' to prevent the selfish and cunnin', as you call 'em,
from gettin' on top THEN as they do now?''The fact that all workers will receive the same pay, no matter what
class of work they are engaged in, or what their position, will ensure
our getting the very best man to do all the higher work and to organize
our business.''Yes: there will be such an enormous quantity of everything produced,
that their wages will enable everyone to purchase abundance of
everything they require.Even if some were paid more than others they
would not be able to spend it.There would be no need to save it, and
as there will be no starving poor, there will be no one to give it away
to.If it were possible to save and accumulate money it would bring
into being an idle class, living on their fellows: it would lead to the
downfall of our system, and a return to the same anarchy that exists at
present.Besides, if higher wages were paid to those engaged in the
higher work or occupying positions of authority it would prevent our
getting the best men.Unfit persons would try for the positions
because of the higher pay.Under the present
system men intrigue for and obtain or are pitchforked into positions
for which they have no natural ability at all; the only reason they
desire these positions is because of the salaries attached to them.These fellows get the money and the work is done by underpaid
subordinates whom the world never hears of.Under Socialism, this money
incentive will be done away with, and consequently the only men who
will try for these positions will be those who, being naturally fitted
for the work, would like to do it.For instance a man who is a born
organizer will not refuse to undertake such work because he will not be
paid more for it.Such a man will desire to do it and will esteem it a
privilege to be allowed to do it.To think out
all the details of some undertaking, to plan and scheme and organize,
is not work for a man like that.But for a man who
has sought and secured such a position, not because he liked the work,
but because he liked the salary--such work as this would be unpleasant
labour.Under Socialism the unfit man would not apply for that post but
would strive after some other for which he was fit and which he would
therefore desire and enjoy.There are some men who would rather have
charge of and organize and be responsible for work than do it with
their hands.There are others who would rather do delicate or
difficult or artistic work, than plain work.A man who is a born
artist would rather paint a frieze or a picture or carve a statue than
he would do plain work, or take charge of and direct the labour of
others.And there are another sort of men who would rather do ordinary
plain work than take charge, or attempt higher branches for which they
have neither liking or natural talent.'But there is one thing--a most important point that you seem to
entirely lose sight of, and that is, that all these different kinds and
classes are equal in one respect--THEY ARE ALL EQUALLY NECESSARY.Each
is a necessary and indispensable part of the whole; therefore everyone
who has done his full share of necessary work is justly entitled to a
full share of the results.The men who put the slates on are just as
indispensable as the men who lay the foundations.The work of the men
who build the walls and make the doors is just as necessary as the work
of the men who decorate the cornice.None of them would be of much use
without the architect, and the plans of the architect would come to
nothing, his building would be a mere castle in the air, if it were not
for the other workers.Each part of the work is equally necessary,
useful and indispensable if the building is to be perfected.Some of
these men work harder with their brains than with their hands and some
work harder with their hands than with their brains, BUT EACH ONE DOES
HIS FULL SHARE OF THE WORK.This truth will be recognized and acted
upon by those who build up and maintain the fabric of our Co-operative
Commonwealth.Every man who does his full share of the useful and
necessary work according to his abilities shall have his full share of
the total result.Herein will be its great difference from the present
system, under which it is possible for the cunning and selfish ones to
take advantage of the simplicity of others and rob them of part of the
fruits of their labour.As for those who will be engaged in the higher
branches, they will be sufficiently rewarded by being privileged to do
the work they are fitted for and enjoy.The only men and women who are
capable of good and great work of any kind are those who, being
naturally fit for it, love the work for its own sake and not for the
money it brings them.Under the present system, many men who have no
need of money produce great works, not for gain but for pleasure: their
wealth enables them to follow their natural inclinations.Under the
present system many men and women capable of great works are prevented
from giving expression to their powers by poverty and lack of
opportunity: they live in sorrow and die heartbroken, and the community
is the loser.These are the men and women who will be our artists,
sculptors, architects, engineers and captains of industry.'Under the present system there are men at the head of affairs whose
only object is the accumulation of money.Some of them possess great
abilities and the system has practically compelled them to employ those
abilities for their own selfish ends to the hurt of the community.Some of them have built up great fortunes out of the sweat and blood
and tears of men and women and little children.For those who delight
in such work as this, there will be no place in our Co-operative
Commonwealth.''If there won't be no extry pay and if anybody
will have all they need for just doing their part of the work, what
encouragement will there be for anyone to worry his brains out trying
to invent some new machine, or make some new discovery?''Well,' said Barrington, 'I think that's covered by the last answer,
but if it were found necessary--which is highly improbable--to offer
some material reward in addition to the respect, esteem or honour that
would be enjoyed by the author of an invention that was a boon to the
community, it could be arranged by allowing him to retire before the
expiration of his twenty-five years service.The boon he had conferred
on the community by the invention, would be considered equivalent to so
many years work.But a man like that would not desire to cease
working; that sort go on working all their lives, for love.He is one of the very few inventors who have made
money out of their work; he is a rich man, but the only use his wealth
seems to be to him is to procure himself facilities for going on with
his work; his life is a round of what some people would call painful
labour: but it is not painful labour to him; it's just pleasure, he
works for the love of it.Another way would be to absolve a man of
that sort from the necessity of ordinary work, so as to give him a
chance to get on with other inventions.It would be to the interests
of the community to encourage him in every way and to place materials
and facilities at his disposal.'But you must remember that even under the present system, Honour and
Praise are held to be greater than money.How many soldiers would
prefer money to the honour of wearing the intrinsically valueless
Victoria Cross?'Even now men think less of money than they do of the respect, esteem
or honour they are able to procure with it.Many men spend the greater
part of their lives striving to accumulate money, and when they have
succeeded, they proceed to spend it to obtain the respect of their
fellow-men.Some of them spend thousands of pounds for the honour of
being able to write "MP" after their names.Others
pay huge sums to gain admission to exclusive circles of society.Others give the money away in charity, or found libraries or
universities.The reason they do these things is that they desire to
be applauded and honoured by their fellow-men.'This desire is strongest in the most capable men--the men of genius.Therefore, under Socialism the principal incentive to great work will
be the same as now--Honour and Praise.But, under the present system,
Honour and Praise can be bought with money, and it does not matter much
how the money was obtained.The Cross of Honour and the
Laurel Crown will not be bought and sold for filthy lucre.They will
be the supreme rewards of Virtue and of Talent.''What would you do with them what spends all their money in drink?''I might reasonably ask you, "What's done with them or what you propose
to do with them now?"There are many men and women whose lives are so
full of toil and sorrow and the misery caused by abject poverty, who
are so shut out from all that makes life worth living, that the time
they spend in the public house is the only ray of sunshine in their
cheerless lives.Their mental and material poverty is so great that
they are deprived of and incapable of understanding the intellectual
and social pleasures of civilization...  Under Socialism there will be
no such class as this.Everyone will be educated, and social life and
rational pleasure will be within the reach of all.Therefore we do not
believe that there will be such a class.Any individuals who abandoned
themselves to such a course would be avoided by their fellows; but if
they became very degraded, we should still remember that they were our
brother men and women, and we should regard them as suffering from a
disease inherited from their uncivilized forefathers and try to cure
them by placing them under some restraint: in an institute for
instance.''Another good way to deal with 'em,' said Harlow, 'would be to allow
them double pay, so as they could drink themselves to death.We could
do without the likes of them.''Call the next case,' said Philpot.'This 'ere abundance that you're always talking about,' said Crass, you
can't be sure that it would be possible to produce all that.You're
only assoomin' that it could be done.'Barrington pointed to the still visible outlines of the 'Hoblong' that
Owen had drawn on the wall to illustrate a previous lecture.'Even under the present silly system of restricted production, with the
majority of the population engaged in useless, unproductive,
unnecessary work, and large numbers never doing any work at all, there
is enough produced to go all round after a fashion.More than enough,
for in consequence of what they call "Over-Production", the markets are
periodically glutted with commodities of all kinds, and then for a time
the factories are closed and production ceases.And yet we can all
manage to exist--after a fashion.This proves that if productive
industry were organized on the lines advocated by Socialists there
could be produced such a prodigious quantity of everything, that
everyone could live in plenty and comfort.The problem of how to
produce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the
problem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and
callous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being
done.'and you'll never be able to get rid of 'em, mate,' cried Crass,
triumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
said that it couldn't be done.'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,' said Barrington.Crass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in
defence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put
forward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen
and gloomy silence.The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
in particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid
that if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would
not have any boots at all.To assume that he had some such thought as
this, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his
case no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to
almost absolute nakedness and starvation.To judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the
present system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing
something, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.It was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more
questions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and
illuminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious
and insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative
Commonwealth.'What,' he demanded, in a loud voice, 'what are you goin' to do, in
this 'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON'T WORK'!'As Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,
ragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the
more intelligent part of the audience only laughed.'We don't believe that there will be any such people as that,' said
Barrington.'There's plenty of 'em about now, anyway,' sneered Crass.'You can't change 'uman nature, you know,' cried the man behind the
moat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed
scornfully.'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,' rejoined Barrington.'It's
only what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers
live in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.The conditions under
which most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and
degrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;
none of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it
were not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when
we do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.Under the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so
avoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do
their loafing better than others.The aristocracy are too lazy to
work, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to
work for them.Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we
and Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us
who do work.Then there is another kind of loafers who go about
begging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable
conditions as are offered to them.These last are generally not much
worse off than we are and they are often better off.At present,
people have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to
work.Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of
labour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and
the reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be
so foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a
social outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of
him by the community of which he was a member.'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be
some, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them
now.We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and
fine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold
and jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow
them to fare sumptuously every day.Our method of dealing with them
would be quite different from yours.In the Co-operative Commonwealth
there will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves
aristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no
share in the things that are produced by the labour of others.If any man will not work, neither
shall he eat.Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to
work may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get
employment.For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you
have any feeling and are able, you will help him.But in the Socialist
State no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was
willing would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing
wealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome
to his full share of the results.'inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy
silence that followed.'I don't want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these
present-day loafers,' Barrington added.'The wealthy ones cannot be
expected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if
they were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would
be doing some poor wretches out of employment.They are not to be
blamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,
who demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.As for
the other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people
of that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,
they also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it
would increase the competition for work.If all the loafers in
Mugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters
next week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an
hour.I don't wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.Some of them are such simply because they would rather starve than
submit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see
the force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to
gain semi-starvation and rags.They are able to get those without
working; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and
are altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited
wretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,
and always in dread of the sack.''Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix
up on equal terms with the likes of us?'demanded the man behind the
moat, scornfully.When we get Socialism there won't be
any people like us.The man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,
and told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.'Now is your chance to
get some of your own back, but don't hall speak at once.''I should like to know who's goin' to do all the dirty work?''If everyone is to be allowed to choose 'is own trade, who'd be
fool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer
man?nobody wouldn't want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be
after the soft jobs.''Of course,' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.'The
thing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn't
never work!''It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,'
replied Barrington, 'if it were found that too many people were
desirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the
conditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as
compared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be
made more severe.If we
found that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers
and so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.This
would scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.We should
thus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very
best men for the work--we should have better doctors, better
architects, better engineers than before.'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty
in obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.Suppose
that six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not
get any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that
department to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for
the disagreeable nature of the work.'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate
division of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it
obligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a
member of this corps.Everyone
gets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring
everyone to share.This would have the effect also of stimulating
invention; it would be to everyone's interest to think out means of
doing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of
it will be done by machinery in some way or other.A few years ago the
only way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each
separate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a
few buttons and light up the town with electricity.In the future we
shall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.''I suppose there won't be no
churches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.''Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to
practise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be
maintained by the State.If any congregation or body of people wish to
have a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or
lecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms
as those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will
construct the special kind of building and the congregation will have
to pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in
paper money of course.As far as the embellishment or decoration of
such places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent
the members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work
as that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have
plenty.''If everybody's got to do their share of work, where's the minister and
clergymen to come from?''There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.First,
ministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the
Veterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of
State service.You must remember that these will not be worn out
wrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.They
will have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all
their lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.They will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be
ideal men for the positions we are speaking of.All well educated in
their youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture
during the years of their State service and they will have the
additional recommendation that their congregation will not be required
to pay anything for their services.'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services
of a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not
completed his term of State service, they could secure him by paying
the State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in
State employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the
National Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to
his pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation
would not have to pay the State anything.'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for
the individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or
whatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of
doing his share of the State service.The hours of obligatory work
would be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of
leisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his
co-religionists.''Of course,' added Barrington, 'it would not only be congregations of
Christians who could adopt any of these methods.It is possible that a
congregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building
or to maintain a lecturer.''What the 'ell's an agnostic?''An agnostic,' said the man behind the moat, 'is a bloke wot don't
believe nothing unless 'e see it with 'is own eyes.''All these details,' continued the speaker, 'of the organization of
affairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which
do not concern us at all.They have merely been suggested by different
individuals as showing some ways in which these things could be
arranged.The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the
opinion of the majority when the work is being done.Meantime, what we
have to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide
productive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of
schoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;
the Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of
private companies.If you wish to see these things done, you must
cease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of
companies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the
House of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.That is--with men who
are in favour of completely changing the present system.And in the
day that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".No
more tramping the streets begging for a job!No more women and
children killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand
idly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.''Is it true,' said Easton, 'that Socialists intend to do away with the
Army and Navy?'Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and
peace.Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,
seeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who
make it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded
common people.You must remember that Socialism is not only a
national, but an international movement and when it is realized, there
will be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain
an army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or
manufacturing arms and ammunition.All those people who are now
employed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of
producing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge
and happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth
and goodwill to all mankind.But in the meantime we know that the
people of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget
that in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large
numbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of
humanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with
profit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and
to rob.We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as
here--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests
always ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,
and to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to
slay each other like wild beasts.And knowing and remembering all
this, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,
aristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be
prepared to defend our homes and our native land.And therefore we are
in favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest
possible state of efficiency.But that does not mean that we are in
favour of the present system of organizing those forces.We do not
believe in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should
continue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home
for the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in
the interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at
Featherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the
people of other nations.Socialists advocate the establishment of a
National Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.We believe that
every able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and
to undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a
professional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him
of the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"
which is only another name for tyranny and despotism.This Citizen
Army could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present
Territorial Force, with certain differences.For instance, we do not
believe--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic
influence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient
officer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no
matter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,
and that there should be no expense attached to those positions which
the Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.The
officers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be
elected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification
required being that they had passed their examinations, or they might
be appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest
number of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any
vacant post, and so on in order of merit.We believe in the total
abolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be
punishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army
being deprived of the rights of a citizen.''Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its
organization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and
to protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a
civil court for any alleged offence.'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were
scientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to
maintain a population of a hundred millions of people.Our present
population is only about forty millions, but so long as the land
remains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be
cultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our
food supply.So long as we are in that position, and so long as
foreign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we
shall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.If we
had a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of
men and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should
be invincible at home.No foreign power would ever be mad enough to
attempt to land their forces on our shores.But they would now be able
to starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.It's
a sensible and creditable position, isn't it?''Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely
starving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"
forbid them to cultivate it.'demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged
silence.'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit
and oppose the speaker?'the chairman went on, finding that no one
responded to his appeal for questions.'As there's no more questions and no one won't get up into the pulpit,
it is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.''Well, Mr Chairman,' said Harlow, 'I may say that when I came on this
firm I was a Liberal, but through listenin' to several lectures by
Professor Owen and attendin' the meetings on the hill at Windley and
reading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to
the conclusion some time ago that it's a mug's game for us to vote for
capitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories.They're
all alike when you're workin' for 'em; I defy any man to say what's the
difference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.There is none--there
can't be; they're both sweaters, and they've got to be, or they
wouldn't be able to compete with each other.And since that's what
they are, I say it's a mug's game for us to vote 'em into Parliament to
rule over us and to make laws that we've got to abide by whether we
like it or not.There's nothing to choose between 'em, and the proof of
it is that it's never made much difference to us which party was in or
which was out.It's quite true that in the past both of 'em have
passed good laws, but they've only done it when public opinion was so
strong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,
and then it was a toss up which side did it.'That's the way I've been lookin' at things lately, and I'd almost made
up my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics
at all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for
Liberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn't
make out how Socialism was going to help us.But the explanation of it
which Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit
of an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move
as a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism
is the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."'The conclusion of Harlow's address was greeted with loud cheers from
the Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the
present system maintained a sulky silence.'I'll second that resolution,' said Easton.'And I'll lay a bob both ways,' remarked Bundy.The resolution was
then put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman
declared it was carried unanimously.By this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,
but as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume
work that day.Besides, it would have been too late, even if the
weather had cleared up.'P'raps it's just as well it 'as rained,' remarked one man.'If it
'adn't some of us might 'ave got the sack tonight.As it is, there'll
be hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin' even
if it is fine.'This was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained
to be done was ready for the final coat.Inside all there was to do
was to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen
and scullery the last coat of paint.It was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do
somewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.'Now,' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a
school teacher addressing children, 'I wants you hall to make a
speshall heffort and get 'ere very early in the mornin'--say about four
o'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on
Saturday.''Yes,' replied Philpot, 'and not honly will you get a prize for good
conduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin' like we've bin doing
lately till you're too hold and wore hout to do any more, you'll be
allowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives!and each
one of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"'Although the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near
relatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!As they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to
the large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:

'You'll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.'Chapter 46

The 'Sixty-five'


The next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and
Barrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called
because it had sixty-five rungs.It was really what is known as a
builder's scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron
bolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.One
side of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round
it spirally.It was not at all suitable for painters' work, being
altogether too heavy and cumbrous.However, as none of the others were
long enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a
struggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the
handcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses
in the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.There had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still
overcast with dark grey clouds.The cart went heavily over the muddy
road; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and
steering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the
cart.It was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill
they were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a
rest.'This is a bit of all right, ain't it?'remarked Harlow as he took off
his cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.While they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who
were likely to pass by at any moment.At first, no one made any reply to Harlow's observation, for they were
all out of breath and Philpot's lean fingers trembled violently as he
wiped the perspiration from his face.'Yes, mate,' he said despondently, after a while.'It's one way of
gettin' a livin' and there's plenty better ways.'In addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he
felt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the
prospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with
it.'A "living" is right,' said Barrington bitterly.He also was exhausted
with the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance
of poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.The unaccountable depression that
possessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled
him with melancholy thoughts.He had travelled up and down this hill a
great many times before under similar circumstances and he said to
himself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a
cart up this road, he wouldn't need to do anyone out of a job all the
rest of his life.The shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the
bottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was
now occupied by more pretentious buildings.Not quite so far down the
road--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to
attend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just
thirty years ago.Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he
would be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other
church, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him
had been one by one laid to rest.He felt that he would not be sorry
when the time came to join them there.Possibly, in the next world--if
there were such a place--they might all be together once more.He was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from
Harlow.Rushton was coming up the hill
in his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.They passed so
closely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed
with mud from the wheels of the trap.'Them's some of your chaps, ain't they?''We're doing a job up this way.''I should 'ave thought it would pay you better to use a 'orse for sich
work as that,' said Grinder.'We do use the horses whenever it's necessary for very big loads, you
know,' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: 'But the donkeys are
quite strong enough for such a job as that.'The 'donkeys' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards
and then they were forced to halt again.'We mustn't stop long, you know,' said Harlow.'Most likely he's gone
to the job, and he'll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.'Barrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to
wait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he
personally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,
the others were not so fortunately circumstanced.While they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing
another cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down
the hill.Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a
degraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes
protruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of
string upon his stockingless feet.The ramshackle cart was loaded with
empty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed
into a large sack.Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and
under-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.As he crept along
with his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to
uncouth, inarticulate sounds.'That's another way of gettin' a livin',' said Sawkins with a laugh as
the miserable creature slunk past.Harlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.He
thought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might
some day become like this man themselves.'I've often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,' said
Philpot.'Made into paper,' replied Harlow, briefly.'Some of them are,' said Barrington, 'and some are manufactured into
shoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.'There's all sorts of different ways of gettin' a livin',' remarked
Sawkins, after a pause.'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke
wot goes about lookin' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of
shops.As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in
it; and then he'd be took to the 'orspital, and when he got better he
used to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and
get damages, and most of 'em used to part up without goin' in front of
the judge at all.But one day a slop was a watchin' of 'im, and seen
'im chuck 'isself down one, and when they picked 'im up they found he'd
broke his leg.So they took 'im to the 'orspital and when he came out
and went round to the shop and started talkin' about bringin' a action
for damages, the slop collared 'im and they give 'im six months.''Yes, I read about that,' said Harlow, 'and there was another case of a
chap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as 'e put
'isself in the way on purpose; but 'e got some money out of the swell
it belonged to; a 'undered pound I think it was.''I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,' said Philpot,
making a feeble attempt at a joke.'I lay I'd get some a' me own back
out of 'em.'The others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that
moment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of
the job.It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and
presently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of
them...

When they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,
but Nimrod had.Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row
because they had not called at the yard at six o'clock that morning for
the ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two
journeys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big
gable had not been started the first thing that morning.They carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along
the side of the house where the gable was.A brick wall about eight
feet high separated the grounds of 'The Refuge' from those of the
premises next door.Between this wall and the side wall of the house
was a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley
or lane or passage along the side of the house.They laid the ladder
on the ground along this passage, the 'foot' was placed about half-way
through; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the
other end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.Next, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the
window of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end
of a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the
ladder.Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the
'foot' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,
while the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.They called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged
that Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the
heaviest.Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to 'raise', and Dawson
and Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.None of them had thought of bringing
one from the yard.'Why, ain't there one 'ere?''Do you
mean to say as you ain't brought one, then?'Philpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at
the house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at
all.'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?''I'll go to the yard and get one,' suggested Barrington.'I can do it
in twenty minutes there and back.'and a bloody fine row there'd be if Hunter was to see you!'Ere
it's nearly ten o'clock and we ain't made a start on this gable wot we
ought to 'ave started first thing this morning.''Couldn't we tie two or three of those short ropes together?''Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?'As there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to
the yard, it was decided to act on Philpot's suggestion.Several of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon
examination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass
had to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder
up with them.'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,' he said, 'is that the boy
will 'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.It won't do
for anyone else to go: there's been one row already about the waste of
time because we didn't call at the yard for the ladder at six o'clock.'Bert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar.Crass
called him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which
was to get back again as soon as ever he could.The boy ran off, and
while they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with
their several jobs.Philpot returned to the small gable he had been
painting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished.As he
worked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him.He did
not want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost
resolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do
something else.There were several younger men who would not object to
doing it--it would be mere child's play to them, and Barrington had
already--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.But then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,
he hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he
would be able to get through with the work all right.He did not want
Crass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.Bert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the
weight of the rope and with the speed he had made.He delivered it to
Crass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,
while Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and
raise the ladder.He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to
the attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end
out of the window down to the others.'If you ask me,' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the
strands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, 'If
you ask me, I don't see as this is much better than the one we made up
by tyin' the short pieces together.Look 'ere,'--he indicated a part
of the rope that was very frayed and worn--'and 'ere's another place
just as bad.''Well, for Christ's sake don't say nothing about it now,' replied
Sawkins.'There's been enough talk and waste of time over this job
already.'Ned made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,
Bundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.The ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.The task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been
able to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was
impossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall
between the two houses.On account of its having to be raised in this
manner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on
the rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able
to see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner
of the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the
brickwork.The end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,
Crass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top
from the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle
position--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on
his left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.At a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,
and the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.Philpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder
for the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on
the rope.His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and
Bundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,
as it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.Meanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet
only a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and
strained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the
corner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and
then, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able
to draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if
those others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or
ceased lifting.The three men found the weight so
overpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their
efforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the
whole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear
the greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the
brickwork at the side of the window.And presently it happened that
one of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was
just at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.On one end
there hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the
corner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the
other end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and
in that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.One end
remained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into
the room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the
lash of a gigantic whip.For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from
side to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised
above his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold
it up.At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the
side; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.For a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering
weight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to
the left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the
wall of the house.He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his
shoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell
across the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the
base of the wall.He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood
streaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.Barrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under
the ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was
unconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to
jump clear when the ladder fell.Their shouts soon brought all the
other men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off
the two motionless figures.At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,
but Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few
minutes.He knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of
Philpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.Barrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting
against the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts
and bruises.The doctor's examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he
rose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner
that their worst fears were realized.Chapter 47

The Ghouls


Barrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he
went to the doctor's house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head
and arms.Philpot's body was taken away on the ambulance to the
mortuary.Hunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to
shout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet
commenced.When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the
rope, and said they should have asked for a new one.Before he went
away he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that
Philpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds
in a society of which Crass was also a member.He knew that Philpot
had arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to
the old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend.The
result of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the
conclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be
relieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,
and that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member
of the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the
business for her.He was already slightly acquainted with the old
lady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on
her behalf.Of course, they would not be able to do much until after
the inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the
mortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a
minute to measure the corpse.This matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,
and shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have
plenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see
Philpot's landlady.He went off so secretly that the men did not know
that he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before
twelve o'clock.The new rope was brought to the house about one o'clock and this time
the ladder was raised without any mishap.Harlow was put on to paint
the gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins
to stand by and hold the ladder all the time.Everyone felt nervous
that afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually
careful manner.When Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work
outside, painting the gate of the side entrance.While the boy was
thus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him
about the accident.The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and
inquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether
he was married.Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that
he had no children.'Ah, well, that's so much the better, isn't it?'said the stranger
shaking his head mournfully.'It's a dreadful thing, you know, when
there's children left unprovided for.You don't happen to know where
he lived, do you?''Yes,' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what
the solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry
for Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.'Thanks very much,' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and
making a note of it.'Good afternoon, sir,' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.Crass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was
disappearing round the corner.said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.'I don't know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether
Joe left any children, and where he lived.He must be a very decent
sort of chap, I should think.'Don't
you know who he is?''No,' replied the boy; 'but I thought p'raps he was a reporter of some
paper.''E ain't no reporter: that's old Snatchum the undertaker.'E's
smellin' round after a job; but 'e's out of it this time, smart as 'e
thinks 'e is.'Barrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time
there was a lot of talk about the accident.They said that it was all
very well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known
for a long time that it was nearly worn out.Newman said that only
about three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another
job he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was
nothing wrong with it.Several others besides Newman claimed to have
mentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received
the same sort of reply.But when Barrington suggested that they should
attend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became
suddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with
Newman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no
good to Philpot.It would not bring him back but it would be sure to
do himself a lot of harm.He would never get another job at Rushton's
and probably many of the other employers would'mark him' as well.'So if YOU say anything about it,' concluded Newman, 'don't bring my
name into it.'Barrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was
right for Newman to mind his own business.He felt that it would not
be fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would
injure themselves.Misery came to the house about eleven o'clock and informed several of
the hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at
pay time.He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so
they could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able
to give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who
were'stood off', although he had expected to be on account of the
speech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have
got the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.Before he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard
at once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making
Philpot's coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time
they got there.Misery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions
with Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the
writing, because it was a very cheap job.When they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,
which was of elm.All that remained to be done to it was the pitching
of the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of
boiling pitch off the fire to do this.As it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so
Crass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and
while he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very
thin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:

                                JOSEPH PHILPOT
                                     Died
                              September 1st 19--
                                Aged 56 years.The inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both
Rushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to
impute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived
to have several friends of their own put on the jury.There was,
however, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that
he had himself noticed, or called Hunter's attention to the state of
the rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others
without their permission.The evidence of Crass and the other men who
were called was to the effect that it was a pure accident.None of them
had noticed that the rope was unsound.Hunter also swore that he did
not know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if
they had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.Philpot's landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and
the end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and
added that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.The coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed
out of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of
being honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory
issue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of
him, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to
get the coroner's certificate authorizing the interment of the body.This document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to
the undertaker acting for them.When Hunter got back to the room he
found that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot's
landlady, who had taken it with her.He accordingly hastened outside
again to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.Crass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return
to work, and after a moment's hesitation Hunter decided that it did not
matter much about the certificate.Crass had arranged the business
with the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.Having
come to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had
several prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the
firm was going to tender for.That evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by
appointment at the carpenter's shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,
where Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o'clock.Hunter's plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,
which was only about a quarter of an hour's walk from the yard; so
tonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid
screwed down.It was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,
carrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.They also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.Crass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.On their way they had to pass the 'Cricketers' and the place looked so
inviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the
damp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with
them, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the
side of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much
danger of anyone pinching it.The Old Dear served them and just as
they finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash
outside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had
blown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the
black cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the
muddy road.Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off
as they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they
resumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting
for them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.The
electric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they
saw that the marble slab was empty.'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,'
explained the keeper.'I was out at the time, and the missis thought
it was all right so she let him have the key.'Hunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.'Well, this takes the biskit!'said the latter as soon as he could
speak.'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old
woman?''I seen 'er on Friday, and I told 'er to
leave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.I told 'er
that Philpot said to me that if ever anything 'appened to 'im I was to
take charge of everything for 'er, because I was 'is best friend.And
I told 'er we'd do it as cheap as possible.''Well, it seems to me as you've bungled it somehow,' said Nimrod,
gloomily.'I ought to have gone and seen 'er myself, I was afraid
you'd make a mess of it,' he added in a wailing tone.'It's always the
same; everything that I don't attend to myself goes wrong.'Crass thought that the principal piece
of bungling in this affair was Hunter's failure to secure possession of
the Coroner's certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say
so.Outside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly
open door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than
usually cold and damp.The empty coffin had been reared against one of
the walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the
keeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.'I can see 'ow it's been worked,' said Crass at last.'There's one of
the members of the club who works for Snatchum, and 'e's took it on
'isself to give the order for the funeral; but 'e's got no right to do
it.''Right or no right, 'e's done it,' replied Misery,'so you'd better
take the box back to the shop.'Crass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were
presently joined by Nimrod.'I've been thinking this business over as I came along,' he said, 'and
I don't see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put
the tressels and the box on a hand cart and we'll take it over to
Philpot's house.'Nimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and
it was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley
where Philpot used to live.They halted in a dark part of the street a
few yards away from the house and on the opposite side.'I think the best thing we can do,' said Misery, 'is for me and Sawkins
to wait 'ere while you go to the 'ouse and see 'ow the land lies.You've done all the business with 'er so far.It's no use takin' the
box unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may
'ave taken it 'ome with 'im.''Yes; I think that'll be the best way,' agreed Crass, after a moment's
thought.Nimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty
house, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the
street and knocked at Philpot's door.They saw it opened by an elderly
woman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and
the door was shut.In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,
leaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over
to where the others were waiting.As he drew near they could see that
he carried a piece of paper in his hand.'It's all right,' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.Misery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match
that Crass struck.It was the certificate right enough, and with a
sigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely
away in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result
of his errand.It appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by
Snatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving
them the order for the funeral.It was they who had put her up to
getting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep
away from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter's or
Crass's suspicions.'When they brought the body 'ome this afternoon,' Crass went on,
'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf 'er, but she'd been thinkin'
things over and she was a bit frightened 'cos she knowed she'd made
arrangements with me, and she thought she'd better see me first; so she
told 'im she'd give it to 'im on Thursday; that's the day as 'e was
goin' to 'ave the funeral.''He'll find he's a day too late,' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.'We'll get the job done on Wednesday.''She didn't want to give it to me, at first,' Crass concluded, 'but I
told 'er we'd see 'er right if old Snatchum tried to make 'er pay for
the other coffin.''I don't think he's likely to make much fuss about it,' said Hunter.'He won't want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.'Crass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the
road and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,
Nimrod going first.The old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the
passage.'I shall be very glad when it's all over,' she said, as she led the way
up the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the
tressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.'I
shall be very glad when it's all over, for I'm sick and tired of
answerin' the door to undertakers.If there's been one 'ere since
Friday there's been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the
cards what's been put under the door, besides the one's what I've had
give to me by different people.I had a pair of boots bein' mended and
the man took the trouble to bring 'em 'ome when they was finished--a
thing 'e's never done before--just for an excuse to give me an
undertaker's card.'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the
greengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy
some vegetables for Sunday dinner.'Arrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a
small and wretchedly furnished room.Across the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace
curtain.The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.There was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the
room a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a
bundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time
of the accident.There was a little table in front of the window, with a small
looking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the
bedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-
carpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.In the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the
coffin containing Philpot's body.Seen by the dim and flickering light
of the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white
sheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.Hunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the
wall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side
of the bed.The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,
and withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.The
three men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the
bed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,
one of which he handed to Hunter.Sawkins held the candle while they
unscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with
them: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools
inside it.'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf
the trussels and puts it on the floor,' remarked Crass.'Yes, I think so, too,' replied Hunter.Crass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other
coffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had
brought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass
furniture.Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they
lifted it off the tressels on to the floor.''E's not very 'eavy; that's one good thing,' observed Hunter.''E always was a very thin chap,' replied Crass.The screws that held down the lid had been covered over with
large-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could
get at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.It was
evident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were
old ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty
and of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they
should have been.They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they
had drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with
perspiration.After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and
the latter had a try at the screws.'Anyone would think the dam' things had been there for a 'undred
years,' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face
and neck with his handkerchief.Kneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the
exertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task.Suddenly
Crass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head
of the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a
similar misfortune happened to Sawkins.After this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got
all the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass
took a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what
was left of the tops of the two that remained.But even after this was
done the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had
to hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the
lid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.It split
up one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.Although the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on
Philpot's face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a
placid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.His hands were
crossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave
clothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the
sides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil
sleep.They laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by
side on the floor as close together as possible.Sawkins stood at one
side holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his
right any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.Crass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while
Hunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,
clawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of
prey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.Whilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave
clothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the
other coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.Then he
selected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having
by this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid.Then they
lifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,
and the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what
they had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same
thought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head
to come there and take the body out again?If he were to do so and
take it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the
certificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.After a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to
take the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the
carpenter's shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.Crass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,
and--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a
task of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the
staircase and the landing.However, they got it down at last and,
having put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.It was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so
Sawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.Hunter wished them 'Good-night' at the corner of the street, because it
was not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be
able to manage all that remained to be done by themselves.He said he
would make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly
could the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,
as soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in
attendance to act as bearers.He had gone a little distance on his way
when he stopped and turned back to them.'It's not necessary for either of you to make a song about this
business, you know,' he said.The two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on
their keeping their mouths shut.When Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.A little way down the road the lights of a public house were
gleaming through the mist.'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck
up,' he said.And with this object they hurried on as fast as they
could.When they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,
and went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he
permitted Sawkins to pay for.'How are we going on about this job?'inquired the latter after they
had each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their
exertions.'I reckon we ought to 'ave more than a bob for it, don't
you?It's not like a ordinary "lift in".''Of course it ain't,' replied Crass.'We ought to 'ave about,
say'--reflecting--'say arf a dollar each at the very least.''I was going to say arf a crown,
myself.'Crass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.''Ow are we going' on about chargin' it on our time sheets?'asked
Sawkins, after a pause.'If we just put a "lift in", they might only
pay us a bob as usual.'As a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time
sheets, 'One lift in', for which they were usually paid one shilling,
unless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes
got one and sixpence.They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.'I think the best way will be to put it like this,' he said at length.Also takin' corpse
to carpenter's shop."Sawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished
their beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.The cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated
with the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.When they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass
in order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very
cautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much
light.A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path
wound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.After much
difficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked
with the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.They soon opened the door of the carpenter's shop and, after lighting
the gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and
placed it upon them.Then they locked the door and placed the key in
its usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with
them and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to
pass on their way home.As they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a
policeman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know
why they had tried the lock...

The next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several
new jobs commenced.Most of them would
only take two or three days from start to finish.Attending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same
he managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,
which he arranged to take place at two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon
from the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,
Hunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start
from the workshop.Although Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small
crowd, including several old workmates of Philpot's who happened to be
out of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and
amongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.Barrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in
order to go to the funeral.They were there too in a sense as the
representatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large
wreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton's men.They could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,
although most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to
their old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.Attached
to the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had
painted a suitable inscription.Promptly at two o'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with
Hunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all
dressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.Although they were
nominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity
in their appearance.Crass's coat was of smooth, intensely black
cloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the
crown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.Hunter's coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour
and his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown
than at the brim.As for the others, each of them had a hat of a
different fashion and date, and their 'black' clothes ranged from rusty
brown to dark blue.These differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had
been purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes
shops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,
they lasted for an indefinite time.When the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid
upon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another
he had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:
'From Rushton & Co.Seeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the
carriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked
if there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor
Barrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone
else's permission, so they got in.Meanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the
hearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.As
the procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at
the corner looking very gloomy.Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight
ahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the
temptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum
that he shouted out:

'It don't matter!The distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they
got out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got
up on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and
two of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver's seat,
the fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they
proceeded at a rapid pace.As they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped
when about fifty yards from the gate.Then Hunter and the bearers
resumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate
and up to the door of the church, where they were received by the
clerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried
the coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved
on a pivot.They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had
placed it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the
foot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.There was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this
Hunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the
clergyman.Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.There was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk
stood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.After a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once
proceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly
unintelligible manner the usual office.If it had not been for the
fact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a
little book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather
the sense of what the man was gabbling.Under any other circumstances,
the spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have
compelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual
really believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.His attitude
and manner were contemptuously indifferent.While he recited, intoned,
or gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and
some other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had
finished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the
chapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon
Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in
their books the words he was repeating.He next turned his attention to
his fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm's length and
critically examining the nails.From time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the
rusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous 'Ah-men', and
after the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the
church, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,
while the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to
the grave.When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,
they were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the
corner of one of the paths.He put himself at the head of the
procession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly
along, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.He had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn
surplice.The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened
by the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it
properly.It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the
black cassock underneath one side than the other.However, perhaps it
is not right to criticize this person's appearance so severely, because
the poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as
this was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,
probably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for
the funerals of the lower classes.He continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the
coffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the
office by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he
was saying:

'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take
unto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore
commit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to
dust--'

The earth fell from the clerk's hand and rattled on the lid of the
coffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished
repeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in
the direction of the church.Hunter and the rest of the funeral party
made their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse
and the carriage were waiting.On their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.It was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.There
was no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.Three men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind
the hearse.As they reached the church door, four old men who were
dressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the
hearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by
the other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.The
four old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid
sixpence each for acting as bearers.They were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter's party
was passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched
them carry it into the church.The roughly made coffin was of white
deal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or
ornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid.None
of Rushton's party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or
to read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would
have seen, roughly painted in black letters

                                     J.L.Aged 67

and some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack
Linden's sons.As for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into
their 'titles'.One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.Chapter 48

The Wise men of the East


At the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at
Rushton's.Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including
Newman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked
as if everyone else would have to stand off also.The summer was
practically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of
getting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were
discharging hands as well.There was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at
all to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.This
firm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had
captured several big jobs that Rushton & Co.had expected to get,
besides taking away several of the latter's old customers.This firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton's could do it
for, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than
Nimrod's thigh.Some of the men who had worked for both firms during
the summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for
Rushton seemed like having a holiday.'There's one bloke there,' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and
Easton.'There's one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o'
paper in a day an' trims and pastes for 'imself; and as for the
painters, nearly everyone of 'em gets over as much work as us three put
together, and if you're working there you've got to do the same or get
the sack.'However much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in
the stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and
Botchit's, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it
very difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what
work there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter
of the time that it would have taken to do it properly.By the end of September there were great numbers of men out of
employment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were
already preparing to enact the usual farce of 'Dealing' with the
distress that was certain to ensue.Mr Bosher talked of
reopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more
money and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had
been depleted by the payment of his quarter's salary.There were
rumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for
the sale of 'nourishment', and charitable persons began to talk of
Rummage Sales and soup tickets.Now and then, whenever a 'job' 'came in', a few of Rushton's men were
able to put in a few hours' work, but Barrington never went back.His
manner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his
former workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was
much better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that
he was never without money.He generally had a tanner or a bob to
lend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it
must have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and
leaflets that he gave away broadcast.He lodged over at Windley, but
he used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he
used often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with
him.It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of
an evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the
other thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were
any children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually
made a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of
cakes or fruit for them.All sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent
affluence.Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had
rich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and
who allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and
did not use his real name.Some of the Liberals said that he was in
the pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split
up the Progressive Liberal Party.Just about that time several
burglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with
the plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington
was the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was
spending so freely.About the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a
state of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects
as unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the
service of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not
only to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was
nothing but right--a higher salary.His pay was to be increased to
seven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per
week, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to
resign his seat and seek re-election.The ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,
their stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for
Mugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way.They
boasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their
broken boots permitted.They stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball's photograph in their
windows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball's
colours--on their underfed children.They said that an election had been sprung
on them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate
ready.They had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of
was the short notice.It wasn't fair because while they--the leading
Liberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous
indifference that is customary, Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been most
active amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing
for the contest.He had really been electioneering for the past six
months!Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football
matches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.He had
joined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull
and Crossbones Boys' Society, and, although he was not himself an
abstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several
occasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the
teas to the poor school children and things of that sort.In short, he
had been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for
months past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the
election was sprung upon them.A hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a
deputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a
week before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.Another meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and
Didlum also being present.Profound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled
slave-drivers as they listened to the delegates' report.The sombre
silence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly
started up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in
going outside the constituency at all to look for a man.It was
strange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.They had been wasting the precious time running about all over the
country, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact
that they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he
believed, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.Surely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to
stand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!While Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred
were reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their
hands and stamp their feet.Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst
forth, and cries of 'Good old Sweater' resounded through the room.When Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had
commenced.He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon
him.There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather
than allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their
request and contest the seat.A roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three
Hundred.Outside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of
poverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots
and other men's cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of
the slave-drivers' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to
be nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the
street and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the
cheering.In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought
his obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,
reminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and
intreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be
carried to victory.At such times these people forgot all about unemployment and
starvation, and became enthusiastic about 'Grand old Flags'.Their
devotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to
carry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and
hungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated
'enemies' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old
flag to victory.The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so
often in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to
damp their ardour in the least.Being philanthropists, they were
content--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do
the looting.At the conclusion of Sweater's remarks the philanthropists gave three
frantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted 'What's the
colour?'After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a'master'
decorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass
green--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the
crowd, who cheered again.Then a rush was made to Sweater's Emporium
and several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up
into little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus
appropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four
deep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the
Grand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill
to Windley, singing to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are
marching':

        'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!Adam Sweater is our man,
        And we'll have him if we can,
        Then we'll always have the biggest loaf for tea.'The spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and
beards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish
twaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.By way of variety they sang several other things, including:

        'We'll hang ole Closeland
        On a sour apple tree,'

and

        'Rally, Rally, men of Windley
        For Sweater's sure to win.'As they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to
strike.It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of
the hour.It was now ten o'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:

        Ding, dong!They all chanted A-dam Sweat-er' in time with the striking clock.In
the same way the Tories would chant:

        'Grab--all Close--land!The town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with
huge posters:

                      'Vote for Adam Sweater!'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.''Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.'or

      'Vote for D'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!'This beautiful idea--'Plenty of Work'--appealed strongly to the Tory
workmen.They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort
of machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for
the benefit of other people.They did not think it right that they
should Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.All they desired
for themselves and their children was 'Plenty of Work'.They marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, 'Work, Boys,
Work and be contented', to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys
are marching', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three
cheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.Both sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night
at the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from
portable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.The Tories said
that the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally
of scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were
fools and scoundrels.A host of richly dressed canvassers descended
upon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the
poverty-stricken working men who lived there.One evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on
Windley Hill.Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great
crowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really
good meal for months.The moon was at the full,
and the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several
torches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.The platform was a
large lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater
himself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.This individual
had made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and
had been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on
account of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other
considerations.Both Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that
night and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to
keep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,
including Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds
a week orators, addressed the meeting.Mingled with the crowd were
about twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge
green rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.They also
distributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different
meetings that were to be held during the election.These men were
bullies hired by Sweater's agent.They came from the neighbourhood of
Seven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.One of their
duties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the
meetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.The hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and
moustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been
for a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister
appearance.He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his
speech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to
them--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew
no bounds.'I've seen him somewhere before,' remarked Barrington, who was standing
in the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.'So have I,' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.'But for the life
of me, I can't remember where.'Harlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their
speculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded
the arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,
Lord Ammenegg.Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had
forgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of
considerable difficulty to mount the platform.However, while his
friends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time
by singing:


        'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.'After a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,
and while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the
crowd.Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the
cheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several
minutes.When at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it
had been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.A large
part of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.Sweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very
effectively.Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but
mistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if
their extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.He lowered his
voice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:

'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few
understand?What is it, and what does it mean?'Then, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the
ears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he
continued:

'It is madness!Black Ruin for the
rich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!'As Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.Men
wearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and
ragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew
pale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.If ever Socialism did
come to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would
have to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without
any trousers or boots at all.Toil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women's shabby cast-off
clothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the
most part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and
margarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who
were trying to bring Ruin upon them.It never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a
condition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.But if Sweater had suddenly
found himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of
those he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought
that he was in a condition of Black Ruin.The awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was
presently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:

'We knows wot they are, sir.Most of 'em is chaps wot's got tired of
workin' for their livin', so they wants us to keep 'em.'Encouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other
Philanthropists, the man continued:

'But we ain't such fools as they thinks, and so they'll find out next
Monday.Most of 'em wants 'angin', and I wouldn't mind lendin' a 'and
with the rope myself.'Applause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater
resumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he
was accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red
ties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.No notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the
chairman, but a few angry cries of 'Order!'Sweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the
crowd became more threatening.Rushton started up and said that he
could not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman
would wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of
asking his question then.The man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and
presently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded
by the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared
menacingly at them.Sweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a
'Slashing Bow at the Enemy' next Monday, and then amid a storm of
applause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.He said that he did not
intend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was
nomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of
addressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to
make a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and
eloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it
seemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone
else to say.But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had
occurred to him that evening.They read in the Bible that the Wise Men
came from the East.Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the
town.They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday
they would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for
Adam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a 'Thumping
Majority'.The Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg's remarks with prolonged,
imbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into
the motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie
or anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing
so.Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and
followed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was
to be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.The crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men
with torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge
black letters, 'Our man is Adam Sweater'.They marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain
on the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.These were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the
Liberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their
meeting and charged the processionists.Both
sides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by
about three to one, they were driven off the field with great
slaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner
was torn to ribbons.Then the Tories went back to the Fountain
carrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of 'Has anyone
seen a German Band?''Has anyone seen a Lib'ral Flag,
        Lib'ral Flag, Lib'ral Flag?'While the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals
rallied in one of the back streets.Messengers were sent in various
directions for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they
emerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting.They
overturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy's
banner to tatters and drove them from their position.Then the
Liberals in their turn paraded the streets singing 'Has anyone seen a
Tory Flag?'and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was
speaking, arriving as the audience left.The crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy
of enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort
of manifesto to the country.In response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had
not heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir
Featherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,
briefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party
proposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and
as they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.He
referred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to
build battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work
for the poor.Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the
rich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.Another tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work
for the poor.A great point was made of the fact that the
rich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of
their road themselves!But nothing was said about how they would get
the money to do it.No reference was made to how the workers would be
sweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest
and Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would
be able to pay for anything at all.These are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at
the rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or
contradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so
reform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will
be able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five
Hundred Years?''Yes, sir,' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious
prospect.'Yes, Sir: we'll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!''I've been waiting all my life,' said one poor old veteran, who had
assisted to 'carry the "Old Flag" to victory' times out of number in
the past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now
in a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the
workhouse yawning open to receive him; 'I've waited all my life, hoping
and trusting for better conditions so a few more years won't make much
difference to me.''Don't you trouble to 'urry yourself, Sir,' shouted another Solomon in
the crowd.You know
better than the likes of us 'ow long it ought to take.'In conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the
Socialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted
to see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded
them that Rome was not built in a day.It did not appear to occur to any of
them that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building
operations had nothing whatever to do with the case.Sir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then
the procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,
they proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune
of the 'Men of Harlech':

        'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!'He's the Man, who has a plan,
        To liberate and reinstate the workers!'Men of Mugs'bro', show your mettle,
        Let them see that you're in fettle!Once for all this question settle
        Sweater shall Prevail!'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and
Didlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches
were at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four
men who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in
frying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily
dressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were
almost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his
cap waved it in the air and shrieked out: 'Three Cheers for Sir
Featherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the
horses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage
instead.''Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if 'e is made Prime
Minister?'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing
up behind the carriage.'Five thousand a year,' replied the other, who by some strange chance
happened to know.'That comes to a 'underd pounds a week.''Little enough, too, for a man like 'im,' said Harlow.'You're right, mate,' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.'Last time 'e 'eld office 'e was only in for five years, so 'e only
made twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course 'e got a pension
as well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,
what's that--for a man like 'im?''Nothing,' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who
was also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be
at least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone
would not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his
pension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way
of thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a
lot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the
crowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing
this they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters
of the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to
refrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed
even by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as
there was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for
the better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom
they met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore
D'Encloseland's colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be
compelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be
disenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it
would ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of
Socialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he
said that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin
upon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When
Barrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a
Socialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be
compelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators
continued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of
literature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:
'Another Liberal Lie.'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for
Socialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the
hypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they
might have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders
was merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately
most of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were
blinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with
maniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but 'carrying their flags to
victory'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other
Socialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the
Liberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the
prevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like
Germany and America, and at Sweater's meetings they requested to be
informed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both
parties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of
violence and requests 'not to disturb the meeting'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some
unwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and
soon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an
absolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to
deny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour
market; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of
unemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed
waiting to take other men's jobs away from them destroys the
independence of those who are in employment and keeps them in
subjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that
this machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make
fortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the
monopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is
the cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments
that they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was
pointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and
Management of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,
having no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome
disputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which
split itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original
subject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,
for most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of
pursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would
be started about something or other; presently an unimportant side
issue would crop up, then the original subject would be left
unfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a
little while another side issue would arise, and then the first side
issue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about
the second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether
forgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out
the best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their
only object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,
with his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and
misery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the
hopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow
workmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the
causes that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes
were so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive
them; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child
could easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but
it seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so
convinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare
to rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign
the management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those
who battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the
poverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel
grip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those
causes to them in such language and in such a manner that they were
almost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the
obvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained
silent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer
and disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the
reason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the
evidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their
masters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they
deemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own
judgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into
them the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their
conviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded
expression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of
themselves and each other--'The Likes of Us!'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to
know, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to
worship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and
robbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools
or scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the
desolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure
for their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it
profitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep
placed themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being
mobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets
without any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening
Barrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly
afterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening
to the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the
hill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding
him loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen
this man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no
reference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington
examined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they
had met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of
the Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town
that Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man
who had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a
stone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man
who had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man
wore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the
shade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,
and Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak
to him.They were in the
vicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,
where several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,
and a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the
pavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by
two or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they
carried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance
of getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid
speakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile
crowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and
vice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,
singing, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole
Sweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of
hooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,
cursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the
pavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against
walls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic
imbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of
the church chimes,

        'Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and
every now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat
each other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about
the respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed
in every line the contempt of those who published them for the
intelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was
one Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in
front of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his
mouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute
who represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the
letterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of
manhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,
but privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such
'men' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more
cunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more
calculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man
with the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and
after glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any
remark.'I hope you'll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a
Socialist?'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and
then become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed
with ghastly distinctiveness.'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever
cease to be one.''You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work
you are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions
since you were here last.''No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is
impossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish
it.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and
degradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows
that that remedy--the state of society that will be called
Socialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the
extermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not
follow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of
knowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order
to help to bring that state of society into being.When I first
acquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell
the good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health
in order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it
willingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,
and that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no
need to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself
in order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing
evil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of
affairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the
present system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good
reason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless
laugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again
full of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I
possess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach
them how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they
might save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did
not want them to give me money.And they paid me
with hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to
rob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money
to his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of
them howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,
others standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of
intelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words
convey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes
gleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for
an opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal
natures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of
blood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make
understand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine
of universal brotherhood and love are for the most
part--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they
feel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of
course--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to
Work.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are
the people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just
as well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason
with them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get
better conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are
the enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if
they get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a
sensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess
for your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get
it, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but
get it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long
pause, 'but it's not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and
anyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my
way some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to
let them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't
see why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to
reason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something
that will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I
have sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable
and right; it will come when the majority of the people are
sufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will
never be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these
people are simply not intellectually capable of abstract
reasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord
Salisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free
libraries: He said: "They don't want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they
have to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies
of grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is
why it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and
that's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means
of object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing
numbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson
which demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in
time compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt
that, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from
theoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,
and then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real
difference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?''Well, you can't keep them both out--you have no candidate of your
own--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of
them to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to
do; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to
make up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word
from your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your
own you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing
yourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I'll
introduce you to Sweater's agent--no one need know anything about it.'He slipped his arm through Barrington's, but the latter released
himself.'Please yourself,' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ
if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to
look after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;
they get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my
way they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present
system means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature
death.Well, let them have what
they vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments
Barrington did not reply.'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said
slowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough
allowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have
been taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own
class with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who
possess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they
are really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their
so-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different
from them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ
from each other, and inferior to them only because they have been
deprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I
do that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in
their cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,
have succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is
their duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves
lowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be
directed against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the
platform in response to a call from his associates.'Go and try to
teach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness
for the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to
them that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not
because of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed
of their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that
inheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful
they'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a
dispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have
taken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,
but the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and
after a while he discontinued it.Like
one awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a
different light.For the first time he properly appreciated the
offensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,
without even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely
refused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the
printing, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them
away.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or
contemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or
forty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound
of many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he
stood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able
to look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street
lamp fell full upon the latter's pale face, as he stood silent in the
midst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,
and whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they
shouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the
Liberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had
saved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be
Robbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who
were too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be
Done Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every
moment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it
difficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity
of doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was
all by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,
who urged them to 'Go for him' and at last--almost at the instant of
Barrington's arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any
longer, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone
who could get within striking distance joined furiously in the
onslaught, reaching eagerly over each other's shoulders, showering
blows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach
his side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their
boots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his
way through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and
elbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the
man who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he
felled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank
back, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running
up.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did
not know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals
went for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few
seconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original
crowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen
got out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in
consequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the
streets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who
owned these carriages...

The result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the
Town Hall, at eleven o'clock that night, and long before that hour a
vast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o'clock it
began to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers
as the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a
terrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero
had conquered.Eleven o'clock came and an intense silence fell upon
the crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign
was to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed
by these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some
great benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of
course that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that
the result of this election would make no more real difference to them
than all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand
voters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was
illuminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of
the two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still
missing, but D'Encloseland's name was on top, and a hoarse roar of
triumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides
with the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After
a time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,
and presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with
Sweater's name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:

        Sweater.4,221
        D'Encloseland.4,200

It was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it
was too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason
of the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but
whatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to
reap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and
shaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with
inexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was
altogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and
made a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the
cheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as 'Slashing Blow',
'Sweep the Country', 'Grand Old Liberal Flag', and so on.Next
D'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,
whom he referred to as 'My friend'.When the two 'friends' disappeared from the window, the part of the
Liberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their
enemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town
Hall, where Sweater's carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had
placed his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid
frantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it
through the mud and the pouring rain all the way to 'The Cave'--most of
them were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again
addressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from
head to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause
of progress!Chapter 49

The Undesired


That evening about seven o'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing
the last of the election, Ruth's child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours
that elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and
Charley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because
Mrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed
tones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied
the kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the
intervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying
in bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared
unnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like
paleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she
waited and listened for the sound of Easton's footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:
a far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from
the direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were
being enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a
furious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and
singing.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those
who can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of
a hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by
his pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of
escape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way
in which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness
of the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering
glance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her
brows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly
reached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly
murmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of
endearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance
passerby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and
fearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading
through all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,
sitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded
lamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some
impending danger.It was after twelve o'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his
footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop
beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had
passed through.It had been Mary's intention to withdraw before he came into the room,
but the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her
so earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how
Ruth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after
this, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that
it was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the
child lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next
fortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when
although weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the
time she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just
then had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give
part of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and
over again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so
the two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and
terrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the
world, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once
she seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the
bed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it
often became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that
she could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her
first thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind
some faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,
for when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her
distress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with
tears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it
with all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very
ill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton's had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were
in a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,
and Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always
told they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to
form a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who
railed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were
paying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their
employment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,
if possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men
were treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where
driving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy
polluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who
were out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,
but also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their
employment.These poor wretches were denounced as'scabs' and
'wastrels' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber
and Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in
obtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest
and bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off
eagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting
one.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton's
office, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and
writing out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible
point in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were
successful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always
appeared equally miserable.If they got the 'job' it often showed such
a small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and
suggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost
the work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber
and Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked
aimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his
bicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of
misery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never
been the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of
them declared, that they wouldn't mind betting that ole Misery would
finish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and
one or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton's, but they
seldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when
there was anything to do.Chapter 50

Sundered


During the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the
delirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very
strange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long
intervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back
to her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he
came out of school and then they used to go home together, taking
little Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able
to look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs
Owen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after
saying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked
whether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to
take charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen's wife gave the required
promise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as
altogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,
but she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as
well.Nora went away about five o'clock, leaving Ruth's bedroom door open so
that Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a
quarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary
Linden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast
asleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had
been very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a
dark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the
wheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another
boy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had
been at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was
working was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past
six when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother's
direction Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask
him to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was
a bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and
after removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and
while he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was
no lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the
prevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the
different objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that
reigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to
the bed and a moment's examination sufficed to tell him that it was
empty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried
search only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen's wife had told her of the strange
request that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his
fears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any
opinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he
rushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps
to Owen's house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where
they thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any
trace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of
the first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely
she would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her
stepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to
Easton's house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of
her, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the
dreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose
business compelled them to be out.About eleven o'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for
Owen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman's figure in
the shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied
house with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it
contained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be
certain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that
there was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to
cross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became
evident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing
there--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the
pillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude
was one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived
that she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost
fainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until
repeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not
let him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went
into the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket
until--crouching on the floor beside Nora's chair with her face hidden
in the latter's lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the
same things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often
before during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account
of her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed
as she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with
self-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over
and over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could
not refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton's presence
seemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and
always haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed
the dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child's.When
she arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night
but she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place
at the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she
had gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had
recently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get
into the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to
put her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the
folly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although
she had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home
again; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or
perhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her
to have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay
someone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she
only had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something
to do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could
not go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets
all night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had
been Frankie's playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a
second-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her
flight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a
recurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the
birth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen's place
in Nora's care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned
home from work, he found a letter in Ruth's handwriting which told him
all there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the
perusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he
found upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous
morning.Slyme's landlady said he had told her that he had been
offered several months' work in London, which he had accepted.The
truth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth's flight--nearly everyone knew
about it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,
guessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen's and took
Freddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child
whilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured
man--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had
happened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from
her, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few
days afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large
boarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an
arrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good
as having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade
himself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden
looked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really
be better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of
Ruth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day
when the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself
rather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame
than she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton
found it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man's words
suggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at
the same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the
street.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the
scarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor
that succeeded it.He never went to Owen's place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor
did she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she
frequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she
often called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its
first bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little
justification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within
him an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget
all that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more
hopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely
from selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost
as soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not
nearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been
formerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the
wintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he
sought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters
of the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same
pleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had
found it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as
to almost make him forget Ruth's existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were
walking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first
time to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his
manner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great
generosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he
said, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the
child.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar
institution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he
knew that her stepmother would not take it.'If you can persuade her to return to you, we'll take the child,' said
Owen.'Do you think your wife would be willing?'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would
like to have the child.''But would you be able to afford it?''Of course,' said Easton, 'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay
something for its keep.'After a long pause Easton continued: 'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to
suggest it to Ruth?''If you like I'll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.''What I meant,' said Easton hesitatingly, 'was that your wife might
just suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best
way, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.''No,' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the
other's manner, 'as things stand now, if it were not for the other
child, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You
seem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being
"willing" to have her back, but she's better off now than she was with
you.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go
back to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you
ill-treated her.'I never raised my hand to her--at least only
once, and then I didn't hurt her.'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I'm
drawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did
worse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of
care for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly
yours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and
to "forgive her"--you're "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me
that it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:

'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to
think right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don't
think either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is
to realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has
something to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways
diverging, they wished each other 'Good night'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new
conservatory at Mr Sweater's house, 'The Cave'.This job was finished
the next day and at four o'clock the boy brought the handcart, which
they loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these
back to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the
front shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were
about to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their
conversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and
silent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had
been engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of
catch in his voice as he spoke.'I've been thinking over what you said last night; it's quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and
admitted it to her.I'll take it as a favour if you and your wife will
say what you can to help me get her back.'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: 'You may
rely on us both to do our best.'Chapter 51

The Widow's Son


The next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o'clock
Hunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better
come on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the
Monday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing 'came in' of course
they did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and
bitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and
a keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had
caught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at
Sweater's house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten
o'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had
not needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to
do.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although
he had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others
were idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all
the summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or
clothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or
some other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to
go without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,
shabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid
up if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,
and that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better
other weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a
day--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o'clock in the evening,
and on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till
one.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings
and sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,
which was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out
of six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one
pound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those
who--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week's wages amounted
to fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.Owing to causes which lie tolerably near the surface, the remarkable
Catholic reaction which took place in France at the beginning of the
present century, has never received in England the attention that it
deserves; not only for its striking interest as an episode in the
history of European thought, but also for its peculiarly forcible and
complete presentation of those ideas with which what is called the
modern spirit is supposed to be engaged in deadly war.For one thing,
the Protestantism of England strips a genuinely Catholic movement of
speculation of that pressing and practical importance which belongs to
it in countries where nearly all spiritual sentiment, that has received
any impression of religion at all, unavoidably runs in Catholic forms.With us the theological reaction against the ideas of the eighteenth was
not and could not be other than Protestant.The defence and
reinstatement of Christianity in each case was conducted, as might have
been expected, with reference to the dominant creed and system of the
country.If Coleridge had been a Catholic, his works thus newly coloured
by an alien creed would have been read by a small sect only, instead of
exercising as they did a wide influence over the whole nation, reaching
people through those usual conduits of press and pulpit, by which the
products of philosophic thought are conveyed to unphilosophic minds.As
naturally in France, hostility to all those influences which were
believed to have brought about the Revolution, to sensationalism in
metaphysics, to atheism in what should have been theology, to the notion
of sovereignty of peoples in politics, inevitably sought a
rallying-point in a renewed allegiance to that prodigious spiritual
system which had fostered the germs of order and social feeling in
Europe, and whose name remains even now in the days of its ruin, as the
most permanent symbol and exemplar of stable organisation.Another
reason for English indifference to this movement is the rapidity with
which here, as elsewhere, dust gathers thickly round the memory of the
champions of lost causes.Some of the most excellent of human
characteristics--intensity of belief, for example, and a fervid anxiety
to realise aspirations--unite with some of the least excellent of them,
to make us too habitually forget that, as Mill has said, the best
adherents of a fallen standard in philosophy, in religion, in politics,
are usually next in all good qualities of understanding and sentiment to
the best of those who lead the van of the force that triumphs.Men are
not so anxious as they should be, considering the infinite diversity of
effort that goes to the advancement of mankind, to pick up the
fragments of truth and positive contribution, that so nothing be lost,
and as a consequence the writings of antagonists with whom we are
believed to have nothing in common, lie unexamined and disregarded.In the case of the group of writers who, after a century of criticism,
ventured once more with an intrepid confidence--differing fundamentally
from the tone of preceding apologists in the Protestant camp, who were
nearly as critical as the men they refuted--to vindicate not the bare
outlines of Christian faith, but the entire scheme, in its extreme
manifestation, of the most ancient and severely maligned of all
Christian organisations, this apathy is very much to be regretted on
several grounds.In the first place, it is impossible to see
intelligently to the bottom of the momentous spirit of ultramontanism,
which is so deep a difficulty of continental Europe, and which, touching
us in Ireland, is perhaps already one of our own deepest difficulties,
without comprehending in its best shape the theory on which
ultramontanism rests.And this theory it is impossible to seize
thoroughly, without some knowledge of the ideas of its most efficient
defenders in its earlier years.Secondly, it is among these ideas that
we have to look for the representation in their most direct, logical,
uncompromising, and unmistakable form of those theological ways of
regarding life and prescribing right conduct, whose more or less rapidly
accelerated destruction is the first condition of the further elevation
of humanity, as well in power of understanding as in morals and
spirituality.In all contests of this kind there is the greatest and
most obvious advantage in being able to see your enemy full against the
light.Thirdly, in one or two respects, the Catholic reactionaries at
the beginning of the century insisted very strongly on principles of
society which the general thought of the century before had almost
entirely dropped out of sight, and which we who, in spite of many
differences, still sail down the same great current, and are propelled
by the same great tide, are accustomed almost equally either to leave in
the background of speculation, or else deliberately to deny and
suppress.Such we may account the importance which they attach to
organisation, and the value they set upon a common spiritual faith and
doctrine as a social basis.That the form which the recognition of these
principles is destined to assume will at all correspond to their hopes
and anticipations, is one of the most unlikely things possible.This,
however, need not detract from the worth for our purpose of their
exposition of the principles themselves.Again, the visible traces of
the impression made by the writings of this school on the influential
founder of the earliest Positivist system, are sufficiently deep and
important to make some knowledge of them of the highest historical
interest, both to those who accept and those who detest that system.At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were three chief
schools of thought, the Sensational, the Catholic, and the Eclectic; or
as it may be put in other terms, the Materialist, the Theological, and
the Spiritualist.The first looked for the sources of knowledge, the
sanction of morals, the inspiring fountain and standard of aesthetics, to
the outside of men, to matter, and the impressions made by matter on the
corporeal senses.The second looked to divine revelation, authority and
the traditions of the Church.The third, steering a middle course,
looked partly within and partly without, relied partly on the senses,
partly on revelation and history, but still more on a certain internal
consciousness of a direct and immediate kind, which is the supreme and
reconciling judge of the reports alike of the senses, of history, of
divine revelation.[1] Each of these schools had many exponents.The
three most conspicuous champions of revived Catholicism were De Maistre,
De Bonald, and Chateaubriand.The last of them, the author of the _Genie
du Christianisme_, was effective in France because he is so deeply
sentimental, but he was too little trained in speculation, and too
little equipped with knowledge, to be fairly taken as the best
intellectual representative of their way of thinking.De Bonald was of
much heavier calibre.He really thought, while Chateaubriand only felt,
and the _Legislation Primitive_ and the _Pensees sur Divers Sujets_
contain much that an enemy of the school will find it worth while to
read, in spite of an artificial, and, if a foreigner may judge, a
detestable style.De Maistre was the greatest of the three, and deserves better than
either of the others to stand as the type of the school for many
reasons.His style is so marvellously lucid, that, notwithstanding the
mystical, or, as he said, the illuminist side of his mind, we can never
be in much doubt about his meaning, which is not by any means the case
with Bonald.To say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity,
De Maistre's extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a
source of strength, which might indeed have been thought indispensable,
if only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did,
without knowing much or anything at all at first-hand about them.Then
he goes over the whole field of allied subjects, which we have a right
to expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the
origin of knowledge, the meaning of ethics, the elements of social order
and progressiveness, the government and scheme of the universe.And
above all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life,
which comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with
which social philosophers have to deal.Lamennais had in many respects a
finer mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally
landed, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example
of the truly Catholic reaction.He obviously represented the Revolution,
or the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's
ruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, '_absolument tuer
l'esprit du dix-huitieme siecle_.'On all these accounts he appears to
be the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that
closed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence.FOOTNOTE:

Joseph de Maistre was born at Chambery in the year 1754.[2] His family
was the younger branch of a stock in Languedoc, which about the
beginning of the seventeenth century divided itself into two, one
remaining in France, the other establishing itself in Piedmont.It is
not wonderful that the descendants of the latter, settled in a country
of small extent and little political importance, placed a high value on
their kinship with an ancient line in the powerful kingdom of France.Joseph de Maistre himself was always particularly anxious to cultivate
close relations with his French kinsfolk, partly from the old
aristocratic feeling of blood, and partly from his intellectual
appreciation of the gifts of the French mind, and its vast influence as
an universal propagating power.His father held a high office in the
government of Savoy, and enjoyed so eminent a reputation that on his
death both the Senate and the King of Sardinia deliberately recorded
their appreciation of his loss as a public calamity.His mother is said
to have been a woman of lofty and devout character, and her influence
over her eldest son was exceptionally strong and tender.He used to
declare in after life that he was as docile in her hands as the youngest
of his sisters.Among other marks of his affectionate submission to
parental authority, we are told that during the whole time of his
residence at Turin, where he followed a course of law, he never read a
single book without previously writing to Chambery to one or other of
his parents for their sanction.Such traditions linger in families, and
when he came to have children of his own, they too read nothing of which
their father had not been asked to express his approbation.De Maistre's
early education was directed by the Jesuits; and as might have been
expected from the generous susceptibility of his temper, he never ceased
to think of them with warm esteem.To the end of his life he remembered
the gloom which fell upon the household, though he was not nine years
old at the time, when the news arrived of the edict of 1764, abolishing
the Society in the kingdom of France.One element of his education he
commemorates in a letter to his favourite daughter.'Let your brother,'
he says, 'work hard at the French poets.Let him learn them by heart,
especially the incomparable Racine; never mind whether he understands
him yet or not.I didn't understand him when my mother used to come
repeating his verses by my bedside, and lulled me to sleep with her
fine voice to the sound of that inimitable music.I knew hundreds of
lines long before I knew how to read; and it is thus that my ears,
accustomed betimes to this ambrosia, have never since been able to
endure any sourer draught.'After his law studies at the University of Turin, then highly renowned
for its jurisconsults, the young De Maistre went through the successive
stages of an official career, performing various duties in the public
administration, and possessing among other honours a seat in the Senate,
over which his father presided.He led a tranquil life at Chambery, then
as at all other times an ardent reader and student.Unaided he taught
himself five languages.English he mastered so perfectly, that though he
could not follow it when spoken, he could read a book in that tongue
with as much ease as if it had been in his own.To Greek and German he
did not apply himself until afterwards, and he never acquired the same
proficiency in them as in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.To be ignorant of German then, it will be remembered, was not what it
would be now, to be without one of the literary senses.Like nearly every other great soldier of reaction, he showed in his
early life a decided inclination for new ideas.The truth that the
wildest extravagances of youthful aspiration are a better omen of a
vigorous and enlightened manhood than the decorous and ignoble faith in
the perfection of existing arrangements, was not belied in the case of
De Maistre.His intelligence was of too hard and exact a kind to
inspire him with the exalted schemes that present themselves to those
more nobly imaginative minds who dream dreams and see visions.He
projected no Savoyard emigration to the banks of the Susquehanna or
Delaware, to found millennial societies and pantisocratic unions.These
generous madnesses belong to men of more poetic temper.But still, in
spite of the deadening influences of officialism and relations with a
court, De Maistre had far too vigorous and active a character to subside
without resistance into the unfruitful ways of obstruction and social
complacency.It is one of the most certain marks, we may be sure, of a
superior spirit, that the impulses earliest awakened by its first fresh
contact with the facts of the outer world are those which quicken a
desire for the improvement of the condition of society, the increase of
the happiness of men, the amelioration of human destiny.With this
unwritten condition of human nature De Maistre, like other men of his
mental calibre, is found to have complied.He incurred the suspicion and
ill-will of most of those by whom he was immediately surrounded, by
belonging to a Reform Lodge at Chambery.The association was one of a
perfectly harmless character, but being an association, it diffused a
tarnishing vapour of social disaffection and insurgency over the names
of all who ventured to belong to it, and De Maistre was pointed out to
the Sardinian court as a man with leanings towards new things, and
therefore one of whom it were well to beware.In very small countries there is seldom room enough
for the growth of a spirit of social revolution; not at least until some
great and dominant country has released the forces of destruction.So,
when the menacing sounds of the approaching hurricane in France grew
heavy in the air, the little lodge at Chambery voluntarily dissolved
itself, and De Maistre was deputed to convey to the king, Victor Amadeo
III., the honourable assurance of its members that they had assembled
for the last time.In 1786, at the age of thirty-two, De Maistre had married, and when the
storm burst which destroyed all the hopes of his life, he was the father
of two children.In one of his gay letters to a venerable lady who was
on intimate terms with them both, he has left a picture of his wife,
which is not any less interesting for what it reveals of his own
character.'The contrast between us two is the very strangest in the
world.For me, as you may have found out, I am the _pococurante_
senator, and above all things very free in saying what I think.She, on
the contrary, will take care that it is noon before allowing that the
sun has risen, for fear of committing herself.She knows what must be
done or what must not be done on the tenth of October 1808, at ten
o'clock in the morning, to avoid some inconvenience which otherwise
would come to pass at midnight between the fifteenth and sixteenth of
March 1810."But, my dear husband, you pay attention to nothing; you
believe that nobody is thinking of any harm.Now I know, I have been
told, I have guessed, I foresee, I warn you," etc."Come now, my dear,
leave me alone.You are only wasting your time: I foresee that I shall
never foresee things: that's your business."She is the supplement to
me, and hence when I am separated from her, as I am now, I suffer
absurdly from being obliged to think about my own affairs; I would
rather have to chop wood all day.... My children ought to kiss her very
steps; for my part, I have no gift for education.She has such a gift,
that I look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the
Holy Ghost; I mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her
to torment her children from morning to night to do something, not to do
something, to learn--and yet without for a moment losing their tender
affection for her.She was
laughingly called by himself and her friends, Madame Prudence.It is
certain that few women have found more necessity for the qualities
implied in this creditable nickname.They had not been married many years before they were overtaken by
irreparable disaster.The French Revolution broke out, and Savoy was
invaded by the troops of the new Republic.Count De Maistre, with his
wife and children, fled from Chambery across the Alps to Aosta.'_Ma
chere amie_,' he said to his wife, by the side of a great rock which he
never afterwards forgot, 'the step that we are taking to-day is
irrevocable; it decides our lot for life;' and the presentiment was
true.Soon the _Loi des Allobroges_ was promulgated, which enjoined upon
all who had left their homes in Savoy to return instantly, under pain of
confiscation of all their property.Madame de Maistre was in the ninth month of her pregnancy.She knew that
her husband would endure anything rather than expose her to the risks of
a journey in such a season.So, urged by a desire to save something from
the wreck of their fortune by compliance with the French decree, she
seized the opportunity of her husband's absence at Turin, and started
for Savoy without acquainting him with her design.Bernard in the beginning of January on the back of a mule,
accompanied by her two little children wrapped in blankets.The Count,
on his return to Aosta two or three days afterwards, forthwith set off
in her steps, in the trembling expectation of finding her dead or dying
in some Alpine hovel.But the favour of fate and a stout heart brought
her safe to Chambery, where shortly afterwards she was joined by her
husband.The authorities vainly tendered him the oath, vainly bade him
inscribe his name on the register of citizens; and when they asked him
for a contribution to support the war, he replied curtly that he did not
give money to kill his brothers in the service of the King of Sardinia.As soon as his wife was delivered of their third child, whom he was
destined not to see again for nearly twenty years, he quitted her side,
abandoned his property and his country, and took refuge at Lausanne,
where in time his wife and his two eldest children once more came to
him.Gibbon tells us how a swarm of emigrants, escaping from the public ruin,
was attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the language of
Lausanne.'They are entitled to our pity,' he reflected, 'and they may
claim our esteem, but they cannot in their present state of mind and
fortune contribute much to our amusement.Instead of looking down as
calm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our domestic harmony
is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit.'Gibbon died in
London almost at the very moment that De Maistre arrived at Lausanne,
but his account of things remained true, and political feuds continued
to run as high as ever.Among the people with whom De Maistre was thrown
was Madame de Stael.'As we had not been to the same school,' he says,
'either in theology or in politics, we had some scenes enough to make
one die of laughter; still without quarrelling.Her father, who was then
alive, was the friend and relative of people that I love with all my
heart, and that I would not vex for all the world.So I allowed the
_emigres_ who surrounded us to cry out as they would, without ever
drawing the sword.'De Maistre thought he never came across a head so
completely turned wrong as Madame de Stael's, the infallible
consequence, as he took it to be, of modern philosophy operating upon a
woman's nature.if Madame de Stael had been
Catholic, she would have been adorable, instead of famous.'We can
believe that his position among the French _emigres_ was not
particularly congenial.For though they hated the Revolution, they had
all drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy, and De
Maistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the Revolution itself.Then again, they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong
government.'Yes,' said the Savoyard exile, 'but be quite sure that, to
make the monarchy strong, you must rest it on the laws, avoiding
everything arbitrary, too frequent commissions, and all ministerial
jobberies.'We may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just
talk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should
restore to them their old prerogatives of anti-social oppression and
selfish corruption.The order that De Maistre vindicated was a very
different thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object
of the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him.After staying three years at Lausanne, De Maistre went to Turin, but
shortly afterwards the Sardinian king, at the end of a long struggle,
was forced to succumb to the power of the French, then in the full tide
of success.Bonaparte's brilliant Italian campaign needs no words here.The French entered Turin, and De Maistre, being an _emigre_, had to
leave it.Furnished with a false passport, and undergoing a thousand
hardships and dangers, he made his way, once more in the depth of a
severe winter (1797), to Venice.He went part of the way down the Po in
a small trading ship, crowded with ladies, priests, monks, soldiers, and
a bishop.There was only one small fire on board, at which all the
cooking had to be done, and where the unhappy passengers had to keep
themselves warm as they could.At night they were confined each to a
space about three planks broad, separated from neighbours by pieces of
canvas hanging from a rope above.Each bank of the river was lined by
military posts--the left by the Austrians, and the right by the French;
and the danger of being fired into was constantly present to aggravate
the misery of overcrowding, scanty food, and bitter cold.Even this
wretchedness was surpassed by the hardships which confronted the exiles
at Venice.The physical distress endured here by De Maistre and his
unfortunate family exceeded that of any other period of their
wanderings.He was cut off from the court, and from all his relations
and friends, and reduced for the means of existence to a few fragments
of silver plate, which had somehow been saved from the universal wreck.This slender resource grew less day by day, and when that was exhausted
the prospect was a blank.The student of De Maistre's philosophy may see
in what crushing personal anguish some of its most sinister growths had
their roots.When the cares of beggary come suddenly upon a man in
middle life, they burn very deep.Alone, and starving for a cause that
is dear to him, he might encounter the grimness of fate with a fortitude
in which there should be many elevating and consoling elements.But the
destiny is intolerably hard which condemns a man of humane mould, as De
Maistre certainly was, to look helplessly on the physical pains of a
tender woman and famishing little ones.The anxieties that press upon
his heart in such calamity as this are too sharp, too tightened, and too
sordid for him to draw a single free breath, or to raise his eyes for a
single moment of relief from the monstrous perplexity that chokes him.The hour of bereavement has its bitterness, but the bitterness is
gradually suffused with soft reminiscence.The grip of beggary leaves a
mark on such a character as De Maistre's which no prosperity of after
days effaces.The seeming inhumanity of his theory of life, which is so
revolting to comfortable people like M. Villemain, was in truth the only
explanation of his own cruel sufferings in which he could find any
solace.It was not that he hated mankind, but that his destiny looked as
if God hated him, and this was a horrible moral complexity out of which
he could only extricate himself by a theory in which pain and torment
seem to stand out as the main facts in human existence.Hope smiled on him momentarily,
but, in his own words: 'It was only a flash in the night.'While he was
in Venice, the armies of Austria and Russia reconquered the north of
Italy, and Charles Emanuel IV., in the natural anticipation that the
allies would at once restore his dominions, hastened forward.Austria,
however, as De Maistre had seen long before, was indifferent or even
absolutely hostile to Sardinian interests, and she successfully opposed
Charles Emanuel's restoration.The king received the news of the perfidy
of his nominal ally at Florence, but not until after he had made
arrangements for rewarding the fidelity of some of his most loyal
adherents.It was from Florence that De Maistre received the king's nomination to
the chief place in the government of the island of Sardinia.Through the
short time of his administration here, he was overwhelmed with vexations
only a little more endurable than the physical distresses which had
weighed him down at Venice.During the war, justice had been
administered in a grossly irregular manner.Hence, people had taken the
law into their own hands, and retaliation had completed the round of
wrong-doing.The higher
class exhibited an invincible repugnance to paying their debts.Some of
these difficulties in the way of firm and orderly government were
insuperable, and De Maistre vexed his soul in an unequal and only
partially successful contest.In after years, amid the miseries of his
life in Russia, he wrote to his brother thus: 'Sometimes in moments of
solitude that I multiply as much as I possibly can, I throw my head back
on the cushion of my sofa, and there with my four walls around me, far
from all that is dear to me, confronted by a sombre and impenetrable
future, I recall the days when in a little town that you know well'--he
meant Cagliari--'with my head resting on another sofa, and only seeing
around our own exclusive circle (good heavens, what an impertinence!)little men and little things, I used to ask myself: "Am I then condemned
to live and die in this place, like a limpet on a rock?"I suffered
bitterly; my head was overloaded, wearied, flattened, by the enormous
weight of Nothing.'In 1802 he received an order
from the king to proceed to St.Petersburg as envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary at the court of Russia.Even from this bitter
proof of devotion to his sovereign he did not shrink.He had to tear
himself from his wife and children, without any certainty when so cruel
a separation would be likely to end; to take up new functions which the
circumstances of the time rendered excessively difficult; while the
petty importance of the power he represented, and its mendicant attitude
in Europe, robbed his position of that public distinction and dignity
which may richly console a man for the severest private sacrifice.It is
a kind destiny which veils their future from mortal men.Fifteen years
passed before De Maistre's exile came to a close.From 1802 to 1817 he
did not quit the inhospitable latitudes of northern Russia.De Maistre's letters during this desolate period furnish a striking
picture of his manner of life and his mental state.We see in them his
most prominent characteristics strongly marked.Not even the
painfulness of the writer's situation ever clouds his intrepid and
vigorous spirit.Lively and gallant sallies of humour to his female
friends, sagacious judgments on the position of Europe to political
people, bits of learned criticism for erudite people, tender and playful
chat with his two daughters, all these alternate with one another with
the most delightful effect.Whether he is writing to his little girl
whom he has never known, or to the king of Sardinia, or to some author
who sends him a book, or to a minister who has found fault with his
diplomacy, there is in all alike the same constant and remarkable play
of a bright and penetrating intellectual light, coloured by a humour
that is now and then a little sardonic, but more often is genial and
lambent.There is a certain semi-latent quality of hardness lying at the
bottom of De Maistre's style, both in his letters and in his more
elaborate compositions.His writings seem to recall the flavour and
bouquet of some of the fortifying and stimulating wines of Burgundy,
from which time and warmth have not yet drawn out a certain native
roughness that lingers on the palate.This hardness, if one must give
the quality a name that only imperfectly describes it, sprang not from
any original want of impressionableness or sensibility of nature, but
partly from the relentless buffetings which he had to endure at the
hands of fortune, and partly from the preponderance which had been given
to the rational side of his mind by long habits of sedulous and accurate
study.Few men knew so perfectly as he knew how to be touching without
ceasing to be masculine, nor how to go down into the dark pits of human
life without forgetting the broad sunlight, nor how to keep habitually
close to visible and palpable fact while eagerly addicted to
speculation.His contemplations were perhaps somewhat too near the
ground; they led him into none of those sublimer regions of subtle
feeling where the rarest human spirits have loved to travel; we do not
think of his mind among those who have gone

    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.If this kind of temper, strong, keen, frank, and a little hard and
mordent, brought him too near a mischievous disbelief in the dignity of
men and their lives, at least it kept him well away from morbid weakness
in ethics, and from beating the winds in metaphysics.But of this we
shall see more in considering his public pieces than can be gathered
from his letters.The discomforts of De Maistre's life at St.The
dignity of his official style and title was an aggravation of the
exceeding straitness of his means.The ruined master could do little to
mitigate the ruin of his servant.He had to keep up the appearance of an
ambassador on the salary of a clerk.'This is the second winter,' he
writes to his brother in 1810, 'that I have gone through without a
pelisse, which is exactly like going without a shirt at Cagliari.When I
come from court a very sorry lackey throws a common cloak over my
shoulders.'The climate suited him better than he had expected; and in
one letter he vows that he was the only living being in Russia who had
passed two winters without fur boots and a fur hat.It was considered
indispensable that he should keep a couple of servants; so, for his
second, De Maistre was obliged to put up with a thief, whom he rescued
under the shelter of ambassadorial privilege from the hands of justice,
on condition that he would turn honest.The Austrian ambassador, with
whom he was on good terms, would often call to take him out to some
entertainment.'His fine servants mount my staircase groping their way
in the dark, and we descend preceded by a servant carrying _luminare
minus quam ut praeesset nocti_.''I am certain,' he adds pleasantly,
'that they make songs about me in their Austrian patois.Sometimes he was reduced so far as to share the soup of his valet, for
lack of richer and more independent fare.Then he was constantly fretted
by enemies at home, who disliked his trenchant diplomacy, and distrusted
the strength and independence of a mind which was too vigorous to please
the old-fashioned ministers of the Sardinian court.These chagrins he
took as a wise man should.They disturbed him less than his separation
from his family.'Six hundred leagues away from you all,' he writes to
his brother, 'the thoughts of my family, the reminiscences of childhood,
transport me with sadness.'Visions of his mother's saintly face
haunted his chamber; almost gloomier still was the recollection of old
intimates with whom he had played, lived, argued, and worked for years,
and yet who now no longer bore him in mind.There are not many glimpses
of this melancholy in the letters meant for the eye of his beloved
_trinite feminine_, as he playfully called his wife and two daughters.'_A quoi bon vous attrister_,' he asked bravely, '_sans raison et sans
profit?_' Occasionally he cannot help letting out to them how far his
mind is removed from composure.'Every day as I return home I found my
house as desolate as if it was yesterday you left me.In society the
same fancy pursues me, and scarcely ever quits me.'Music, as might be
surmised in so sensitive a nature, drove him almost beside himself with
its mysterious power of intensifying the dominant emotion.'Whenever by
any chance I hear the harpsichord,' he says,'melancholy seizes me.The
sound of the violin gives me such a heavy heart, that I am fain to leave
the company and hasten home.'He tossed in his bed at night, thinking he
heard the sound of weeping at Turin, making a thousand efforts to
picture to himself the looks of that 'orphan child of a living father'
whom he had never known, wondering if ever he should know her, and
battling with a myriad of black phantoms that seemed to rustle in his
curtains.'But you, M. de Chevalier,' he said apologetically to the
correspondent to whom he told these dismal things, 'you are a father,
you know the cruel dreams of a waking man; if you were not of the
profession I would not allow my pen to write you this jeremiad.'As De
Maistre was accustomed to think himself happy if he got three hours'
sound sleep in the night, these sombre and terrible vigils were ample
enough to excuse him if he had allowed them to overshadow all other
things.But the vigour of his intellect was too strenuous, and his
curiosity and interest in every object of knowledge too
inextinguishable.'After all,' he said, 'the only thing to do is to put
on a good face, and to march to the place of torture with a few friends
to console you on the way.This is the charming image under which I
picture my present situation.Mark you,' he added, 'I always count books
among one's consoling friends.'In one of the most gay and charming of his letters, apologising to a
lady for the remissness of his correspondence, he explains that
diplomacy and books occupy every moment.'You will admit, madam, there
is no possibility of one's shutting up books entirely.Nay, more than
ever, I feel myself burning with the feverish thirst for knowledge.I
have had an access of it which I cannot describe to you.The most
curious books literally run after me, and hurry voluntarily to place
themselves in my hands.As soon as diplomacy gives me a moment of
breathing-time I rush headlong to that favourite pasture, to that
ambrosia of which the mind can never have enough--

    _Et voila ce qui fait que votre ami est muet._'

He thinks himself happy if, by refusing invitations to dinner, he can
pass a whole day without stirring from his house.'I read, I write, I
study; for after all one must know something.'In his hours of
depression he fancied that he only read and worked, not for the sake of
the knowledge, but to stupefy and tire himself out, if that were
possible.As a student De Maistre was indefatigable.He never belonged to that
languid band who hoped to learn difficult things by easy methods.The
only way, he warned his son, is to shut your door, to say that you are
not within, and to work.'Since they have set themselves to teach us how
we ought to learn the dead languages, you can find nobody who knows
them; and it is amusing enough that people who don't know them, should
be so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods
employed by us who do know them.'He was one of those wise and laborious
students who do not read without a pen in their hands.He never shrank
from the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he
read everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service
to him in his inquiries.As soon as one of
them was filled, he carefully made up an index of its contents, numbered
it, and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors.In one
place he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios
over the head of his writing-table.'If I am a pedant at home,' he said, 'at least I am as little as
possible a pedant out of doors.'In the evening he would occasionally
seek the society of ladies, by way of recovering some of that native
gaiety of heart which had hitherto kept him alive.'I blow on this
spark,' to use his own words, 'just as an old woman blows among the
ashes to get a light for her lamp.'A student and a thinker, De Maistre
was also a man of the world, and he may be added to the long list of
writers who have shown that to take an active part in public affairs and
mix in society give a peculiar life, reality, and force to both
scholarship and speculation.It was computed at that time that the
author of a philosophic piece could not safely count upon more than a
hundred and fifty readers in Russia; and hence, we might be sure, even
if we had not De Maistre's word for it, that away from his own house he
left his philosophy behind.The vehemence of his own convictions did not
prevent him from being socially tolerant to others who hated them.'If I
had the good fortune to be among his acquaintances,' he wrote of a
heretical assailant, 'he would see that among the people with
convictions it would be hard to find one so free from prejudice as I am.I have many friends among the Protestants, and now that their system is
tottering, they are all the dearer to me.'In spite of his scanty means,
his shabby valet, his threadbare cloak, and the humbleness of his
diplomatic position, the fire and honesty of his character combined with
his known ability to place him high in the esteem of the society of St.His fidelity, devotion, and fortitude, mellowed by many
years and by meditative habits, and tinged perhaps by the patrician
consciousness of birth, formed in him a modest dignity of manner which
men respected.They perceived it to be no artificial assumption, but the
outward image of a lofty and self-respecting spirit.His brother
diplomatists, even the representatives of France, appear to have treated
him with marked consideration.His letters prove him to have been a
favourite among ladies.The Emperor Alexander showed him considerable
kindness of the cheap royal sort.He conferred on his brother, Xavier de
Maistre, a post in one of the public museums, while to the Sardinian
envoy's son he gave a commission in the Russian service.The first departure of this son for the campaign of 1807 occasioned some
of the most charming passages in De Maistre's letters, both to the young
soldier himself and to others.For though without a touch of morbid
expansiveness, he never denied himself the solace of opening his heart
to a trusted friend, and a just reserve with strangers did not hinder a
humane and manly confidence with intimates.'This morning,' he wrote to
his stripling, soon after he had joined the army, 'I felt a tightening
at my heart when a pet dog came running in and jumped upon your bed,
where he finds you no more.He soon perceived his mistake, and said
clearly enough, after his own fashion: _I am mistaken; where can he be
then?_ As for me I have felt all that you will feel, if ever you pursue
this mighty trade of being a father.'And then he begs of his son if he
should find himself with a tape line in his hand, that he will take his
exact measure and forward it.Soon came the news of the battle of
Friedland, and the unhappy father thought he read the fate of his son in
the face of every acquaintance he met.And so it was in later campaigns,
as De Maistre records in correspondence that glows with tender and
healthy solicitude.All this is worth dwelling upon, for two reasons.First, because De Maistre has been too much regarded and spoken of as a
man of cold sensibility, and little moved by the hardships which fill
the destiny of our unfortunate race.And, secondly, because his own keen
acquaintance with mental anguish helps us to understand the zeal with
which he attempts to reconcile the blind cruelty and pain and torture
endured by mortals with the benignity and wisdom of the immortal.'After
all,' he used to say, 'there are only two real evils--remorse and
disease.'This is true enough for an apophthegm, but as a matter of fact
it never for an instant dulled his sensibility to far less supreme forms
of agony than the recollection of irreparable pain struck into the lives
of others.It is interesting and suggestive to recall how a later
publicist viewed the ills that dwarf our little lives.'If I were asked
to class human miseries,' said Tocqueville, 'I would do so in this
order: first, Disease; second, Death; third, Doubt.'At a later date, he
altered the order, and deliberately declared doubt to be the most
insupportable of all evils, worse than death itself.But Tocqueville was
an aristocrat, as Guizot once told him, who accepted his defeat.He
stood on the brink of the great torrent of democracy, and shivered.De
Maistre was an aristocrat too, but he was incapable of knowing what
doubt or hesitation meant.He never dreamt that his cause was lost, and
he mocked and defied the Revolution to the end.We easily see how
natures of this sort, ardent, impetuous, unflinching, find themselves in
the triumphant paths that lead to remorse at their close, and how they
thus come to feel remorse rather than doubt as the consummate agony of
the human mind.Having had this glimpse of De Maistre's character away from his books,
we need not linger long over the remaining events of his life.In 1814
his wife and two daughters joined him in the Russian capital.Two years
later an outburst of religious fanaticism caused the sudden expulsion of
the Jesuits from Russia, to De Maistre's deep mortification.Several
conversions had taken place from the Orthodox to the Western faith, and
these inflamed the Orthodox party, headed by the Prince de Galitzin, the
minister of public worship, with violent theological fury.De Maistre,
whose intense attachment to his own creed was well known, fell under
suspicion of having connived at these conversions, and the Emperor
himself went so far as to question him.'I told him,' De Maistre says,
'that I had never changed the faith of any of his subjects, but that if
any of them had by chance made me a sharer of their confidence, neither
honour nor conscience would have allowed me to tell them that they were
wrong.'This kind of dialogue between a sovereign and an ambassador
implied a situation plainly unfavourable to effective diplomacy.The
envoy obtained his recall, and after twenty-five years' absence returned
to his native country (1817).On his way home, it may be noticed, De
Maistre passed a few days in Paris, and thus, for the first and last
time, one of the most eminent of modern French writers found himself on
French soil.The king accorded De Maistre an honourable reception, conferred upon him
a high office and a small sum of money, and lent his ear to other
counsellors.The philosopher, though insisting on declaring his
political opinions, then, as ever, unwaveringly anti-revolutionary,
threw himself mainly upon that literary composition which had been his
solace in yet more evil days than these.It was at this time that he
gave to the world the supreme fruit of nearly half a century of study,
meditation, and contact with the world, in _Du Pape_, _Les Soirees de
Saint Petersbourg_, and _L'Eglise Gallicane_.Their author did not live
long to enjoy the vast discussion which they occasioned, nor the
reputation that they have since conferred upon his name.He died in
February 1821 after such a life as we have seen.FOOTNOTE:

[2] The facts of De Maistre's life I have drawn from a very meagre
biography by his son, Count Rodolphe de Maistre, supplemented by two
volumes of _Lettres et Opuscules_ (Fourth edition.1865),
and a volume of his _Diplomatic Correspondence_, edited by M. Albert
Blanc.It is not at all surprising that they upon whom the revolutionary deluge
came should have looked with indiscriminating horror and affright on all
the influences which in their view had united first to gather up, and
then to release the destructive flood.The eighteenth century to men
like De Maistre seemed an infamous parenthesis, mysteriously interposed
between the glorious age of Bossuet and Fenelon, and that yet brighter
era for faith and the Church which was still to come in the good time of
Divine Providence.The philosophy of the last century, he says on more
than one occasion, will form one of the most shameful epochs of the
human mind: it never praised even good men except for what was bad in
them.He looked upon the gods whom that century had worshipped as the
direct authors of the bloodshed and ruin in which their epoch had
closed.The memory of mild and humane philosophers was covered with the
kind of black execration that prophets of old had hurled at Baal or
Moloch; Locke and Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau, were habitually spoken of
as very scourges of God.From this temper two consequences naturally
flowed.In the first place, while it lasted there was no hope of an
honest philosophic discussion of the great questions which divide
speculative minds.Moderation and impartiality were virtues of almost
superhuman difficulty for controversialists who had made up their minds
that it was their opponents who had erected the guillotine, confiscated
the sacred property of the church, slaughtered and banished her
children, and filled the land with terror and confusion.It is hard amid
the smoking ruins of the homestead to do full justice to the theoretical
arguments of the supposed authors of the conflagration.Hence De
Maistre, though, as has been already said, intimately acquainted with
the works of his foes in the letter, was prevented by the vehemence of
his antipathy to the effects which he attributed to them, from having
any just critical estimate of their value and true spirit.'I do not
know one of these men,' he says of the philosophers of the eighteenth
century, 'to whom the sacred title of honest man is quite suitable.'Their very names '_me dechirent la
bouche_.'To admire Voltaire is the sign of a corrupt soul; and if
anybody is drawn to the works of Voltaire, then be sure that God does
not love such an one.The divine anathema is written on the very face of
this arch-blasphemer; on his shameless brow, in the two extinct craters
still sparkling with sensuality and hate, in that frightful _rictus_
running from ear to ear, in those lips tightened by cruel malice, like a
spring ready to fly back and launch forth blasphemy and sarcasm; he
plunges into the mud, rolls in it, drinks of it; he surrenders his
imagination to the enthusiasm of hell, which lends him all its forces;
Paris crowned him, Sodom would have banished him.[3] Locke, again, did
not understand himself.His distinguishing characteristics are
feebleness and precipitancy of judgment.Vagueness and irresolution
reign in his expressions as they do in his thoughts.He constantly
exhibits that most decisive sign of mediocrity--he passes close by the
greatest questions without perceiving them.In the study of philosophy,
contempt for Locke is the beginning of knowledge.[4] Condillac was even
more vigilantly than anybody else on his guard against his own
conscience.But Hume was perhaps the most dangerous and the most guilty
of all those mournful writers who will for ever accuse the last century
before posterity--the one who employed the most talent with the most
coolness to do most harm.[5] To Bacon De Maistre paid the compliment of
composing a long refutation of his main ideas, in which Bacon's
blindness, presumption, profanity, and scientific charlatanry are
denounced in vehement and almost coarse terms, and treated as the
natural outcome of a low morality.It has long been the inglorious speciality of the theological school to
insist in this way upon moral depravity as an antecedent condition of
intellectual error.De Maistre in this respect was not unworthy of his
fellows.He believed that his opponents were even worse citizens than
they were bad philosophers, and it was his horror of them in the former
capacity that made him so bitter and resentful against them in the
latter.He could think of no more fitting image for opinions that he did
not happen to believe than counterfeit money, 'which is struck in the
first instance by great criminals, and is afterwards passed on by honest
folk who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they do.'A
philosopher of the highest class, we may be sure, does not permit
himself to be drawn down from the true object of his meditations by
these sinister emotions.But De Maistre belonged emphatically to minds
of the second order, whose eagerness to find truth is never intense and
pure enough to raise them above perturbing antipathies to persons.His
whole attitude was fatal to his claim to be heard as a truth-seeker in
any right sense of the term.He was not only persuaded of the general
justice and inexpugnableness of the orthodox system, but he refused to
believe that it was capable of being improved or supplemented by
anything which a temperate and fair examination of other doctrines might
peradventure be found to yield.With De Maistre there was no
peradventure.Again, no speculative mind of the highest order ever
mistakes, or ever moves systematically apart from, the main current of
the social movement of its time.It is implied in the very definition of
a thinker of supreme quality that he should detect, and be in a certain
accord with, the most forward and central of the ruling tendencies of
his epoch.Three-quarters of a century have elapsed since De Maistre was
driven to attempt to explain the world to himself, and this interval
has sufficed to show that the central conditions at that time for the
permanent reorganisation of the society which had just been so violently
rent in pieces, were assuredly not theological, military, nor
ultramontane, but the very opposite of all these.There was a second consequence of the conditions of the time.The
catastrophe of Europe affected the matter as well as the manner of
contemporary speculation.The French Revolution has become to us no more
than a term, though the strangest term in a historic series.To some of
the best of those who were confronted on every side by its tumult and
agitation, it was the prevailing of the gates of hell, the moral
disruption of the universe, the absolute and total surrender of the
world to them that plough iniquity and sow wickedness.Even under
ordinary circumstances few men have gone through life without
encountering some triumphant iniquity, some gross and prolonged cruelty,
which makes them wonder how God should allow such things to be.If we
remember the aspect which the Revolution wore in the eyes of those who
seeing it yet did not understand, we can imagine what dimensions this
eternal enigma must have assumed in their sight.It was inevitable that
the first problem to press on men with resistless urgency should be the
ancient question of the method of the Creator's temporal government.What is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune?How can we
vindicate with regard to the conditions of this life, the different
destinies that fall to men?How can we defend the moral ordering of a
world in which the wicked and godless constantly triumph, while the
virtuous and upright who retain their integrity are as frequently
buffeted and put to shame?This tremendous question has never been presented with such sublimity of
expression, such noble simplicity and force of thought, as in the
majestic and touching legend of Job.But its completeness, as a
presentation of the human tragedy, is impaired by the excessive
prosperity which is finally supposed to reward the patient hero for his
fortitude.Job received twice as much as he had before, and his latter
end was blessed more than his beginning.In the chronicles of actual
history men fare not so.There is a terribly logical finish about some
of the dealings of fate, and in life the working of a curse is seldom
stayed by any dramatic necessity for a smooth consummation.No statement of
the case is adequate which maintains, by ever so delicate an
implication, that in the long run and somehow it is well in temporal
things with the just, and ill with the unjust.Until we have firmly
looked in the face the grim truth that temporal rewards and punishments
do not follow the possession or the want of spiritual or moral virtue,
so long we are still ignorant what that enigma is, which speculative
men, from the author of the book of Job downwards, have striven to
resolve.We can readily imagine the fulness with which the question
would grow up in the mind of a royalist and Catholic exile at the end of
the eighteenth century.Nothing can be more clearly put than De Maistre's answers to the
question which the circumstances of the time placed before him to solve.What is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune in this
life?Do prosperity and adversity fall respectively
to the just and the unjust, either individually or collectively?Has the
ancient covenant been faithfully kept, that whoso hearkens diligently to
the divine voice, and observes all the commandments to do them, shall be
blessed in his basket and his store and in all the work of his hand?Or
is God a God that hideth himself?De Maistre perceived that the optimistic conception of the deity as
benign, merciful, infinitely forgiving, was very far indeed from
covering the facts.So he insisted on seeing in human destiny the
ever-present hand of a stern and terrible judge, administering a
Draconian code with blind and pitiless severity.God created men under
conditions which left them free to choose between good and evil.All the
physical evil that exists in the world is a penalty for the moral evil
that has resulted from the abuse by men of this freedom of choice.For
these physical calamities God is only responsible in the way in which a
criminal judge is responsible for a hanging.Men cannot blame the judge
for the gallows; the fault is their own in committing those offences for
which hanging is prescribed beforehand as the penalty.These curses
which dominate human life are not the result of the cruelty of the
divine ruler, but of the folly and wickedness of mankind, who, seeing
the better course, yet deliberately choose the worse.The order of the
world is overthrown by the iniquities of men; it is we who have provoked
the exercise of the divine justice, and called down the tokens of his
vengeance.The misery and disaster that surround us like a cloak are the
penalty of our crimes and the price of our expiation.Thomas has said: _Deus est auctor mali quod est poena, non autem mali
quod est culpa._ There is a certain quantity of wrong done over the face
of the world; therefore the great Judge exacts a proportionate quantity
of punishment.The total amount of evil suffered makes nice equation
with the total amount of evil done; the extent of human suffering
tallies precisely with the extent of human guilt.Of course you must
take original sin into account, 'which explains all, and without which
you can explain nothing.''In virtue of this primitive degradation we
are subject to all sorts of physical sufferings _in general_; just as in
virtue of this same degradation we are subject to all sorts of vices _in
general_.This original malady therefore [which is the correlative of
original sin] has no other name.It is only the capacity of suffering
all evils, as original sin is only the capacity of committing all
crimes.'[6] Hence all calamity is either the punishment of sins actually
committed by the sufferers, or else it is the general penalty exacted
for general sinfulness.Sometimes an innocent being is stricken, and a
guilty being appears to escape.But is it not the same in the
transactions of earthly tribunals?And yet we do not say that they are
conducted without regard to justice and righteousness.'When God
punishes any society for the crimes that it has committed, he does
justice as we do justice ourselves in these sorts of circumstance.A
city revolts; it massacres the representatives of the sovereign; it
shuts its gates against him; it defends itself against his arms; it is
taken.The prince has it dismantled and deprived of all its privileges;
nobody will find fault with this decision on the ground that there are
innocent persons shut up in the city.'[7]

De Maistre's deity is thus a colossal Septembriseur, enthroned high in
the peaceful heavens, demanding ever-renewed holocausts in the name of
the public safety.It is true, as a general rule of the human mind, that the objects which
men have worshipped have improved in morality and wisdom as men
themselves have improved.The quiet gods, without effort of their own,
have grown holier and purer by the agitations and toil which civilise
their worshippers.In other words, the same influences which elevate and
widen our sense of human duty give corresponding height and nobleness to
our ideas of the divine character.The history of the civilisation of
the earth is the history of the civilisation of Olympus also.It will be
seen that the deity whom De Maistre sets up is below the moral level of
the time in respect of Punishment.In intellectual matters he vehemently
proclaimed the superiority of the tenth or the twelfth over the
eighteenth century, but it is surely carrying admiration for those loyal
times indecently far, to seek in the vindictive sackings of revolted
towns, and the miscellaneous butcheries of men, women, and babes, which
then marked the vengeance of outraged sovereignty, the most apt parallel
and analogy for the systematic administration of human society by its
Creator.Such punishment can no longer be regarded as moral in any deep
or permanent sense; it implies a gross, harsh, and revengeful character
in the executioner, that is eminently perplexing and incredible to those
who expect to find an idea of justice in the government of the world, at
least not materially below what is attained in the clumsy efforts of
uninspired publicists.In mere point of administration, the criminal code which De Maistre put
into the hands of the Supreme Being works in a more arbitrary and
capricious manner than any device of an Italian Bourbon.As Voltaire
asks--

    _Lisbonne, qui n'est plus, eut-elle plus de vices
    Que Londres, que Paris, plonges dans les delices?Lisbonne est abimee, et l'on danse a Paris._


Stay, De Maistre replies, look at Paris thirty years later, not dancing,
but red with blood.This kind of thing is often said, even now; but it
is really time to abandon the prostitution of the name of Justice to a
process which brings Lewis XVI.to the block, and consigns De Maistre to
poverty and exile, because Lewis XIV., the Regent, and Lewis XV.had
been profligate men or injudicious rulers.The reader may remember how
the unhappy Emperor Maurice as his five innocent sons were in turn
murdered before his eyes, at each stroke piously ejaculated: 'Thou art
just, O Lord!'[8] Any name would befit
this kind of transaction better than that which, in the dealings of men
with one another at least, we reserve for the honourable anxiety that he
should reap who has sown, that the reward should be to him who has
toiled for it, and the pain to him who has deliberately incurred it.What is gained by attributing to the divine government a method tainted
with every quality that could vitiate the enactment of penalties by a
temporal sovereign?We need not labour this part of the discussion further.Though conducted
with much brilliance and vigour by De Maistre, it is not his most
important nor remarkable contribution to thought.Before passing on to
that, it is worth while to make one remark.It will be inferred from De
Maistre's general position that he was no friend to physical science.Just as moderns see in the advance of the methods and boundaries of
physical knowledge the most direct and sure means of displacing the
unfruitful subjective methods of old, and so of renovating the entire
field of human thought and activity, so did De Maistre see, as his
school has seen since, that here was the stronghold of his foes.'Ah,
how dearly,' he exclaimed, 'has man paid for the natural sciences!'Not
but that Providence designed that man should know something about them;
only it must be in due order.The ancients were not permitted to attain
to much or even any sound knowledge of physics, indisputably above us as
they were in force of mind, a fact shown by the superiority of their
languages which ought to silence for ever the voice of our modern pride.Why did the ancients remain so ignorant of natural science?'When all Europe was Christian, when the priests
were the universal teachers, when all the establishments of Europe were
Christianised, when theology had taken its place at the head of all
instruction, and the other faculties were ranged around her like maids
of honour round their queen, the human race being thus prepared, then
the natural sciences were given to it.'Science must be kept in its
place, for it resembles fire which, when confined in the grates prepared
for it, is the most useful and powerful of man's servants; scattered
about anyhow, it is the most terrible of scourges.Whence the marked
supremacy of the seventeenth century, especially in France?From the
happy accord of religion, science, and chivalry, and from the supremacy
conceded to the first.The more perfect theology is in a country the
more fruitful it is in true science; and that is why Christian nations
have surpassed all others in the sciences, and that is why the Indians
and Chinese will never reach us, so long as we remain respectively as we
are.The more theology is cultivated, honoured, and supreme, then, other
things being equal, the more perfect will human science be: that is to
say, it will have the greater force and expansion, and will be the more
free from every mischievous and perilous connection.[9]

Little would be gained here by serious criticism of a view of this kind
from a positive point.How little, the reader will understand from De
Maistre's own explanations of his principles of Proof and Evidence.'They have called to witness against Moses,' he says, 'history,
chronology, astronomy, geology, etc.The objections have disappeared
before true science; but those were profoundly wise who despised them
before any inquiry, or who only examined them in order to discover a
refutation, but without ever doubting that there was one.Even a
mathematical objection ought to be despised, for though it may be a
demonstrated truth, still you will never be able to demonstrate that it
contradicts a truth that has been demonstrated before.'His final
formula he boldly announced in these words: '_Que toutes les fois qu'une
proposition sera prouvee par le genre de preuve qui lui appartient,
l'objection quelconque,_ MEME INSOLUBLE, _ne doit plus etre ecoutee._'
Suppose, for example, that by a consensus of testimony it were perfectly
proved that Archimedes set fire to the fleet of Marcellus by a
burning-glass; then all the objections of geometry disappear.Prove if
you can, and if you choose, that by certain laws a glass, in order to be
capable of setting fire to the Roman fleet, must have been as big as the
whole city of Syracuse, and ask me what answer I have to make to that.'_J'ai a vous repondre qu'Archimede brula la flotte romaine avec un
miroir ardent._'

The interesting thing about such opinions as these is not the exact
height and depth of their falseness, but the considerations which could
recommend them to a man of so much knowledge, both of books and of the
outer facts of life, and of so much natural acuteness as De Maistre.Persons who have accustomed themselves to ascertained methods of proof,
are apt to look on a man who vows that if a thing has been declared
true by some authority whom he respects, then that constitutes proof to
him, as either the victim of a preposterous and barely credible
infatuation, or else as a flat impostor.Yet De Maistre was no ignorant
monk.He had no selfish or official interest in taking away the
keys of knowledge, entering not in himself, and them that would
enter in hindering.The true reasons for his detestation of the
eighteenth-century philosophers, science, and literature, are simple
enough.Like every wise man, he felt that the end of all philosophy and
science is emphatically social, the construction and maintenance and
improvement of a fabric under which the communities of men may find
shelter, and may secure all the conditions for living their lives with
dignity and service.Then he held that no truth can be harmful to
society.If he found any system of opinions, any given attitude of the
mind, injurious to tranquillity and the public order, he instantly
concluded that, however plausible they might seem when tested by logic
and demonstration, they were fundamentally untrue and deceptive.What is
logic compared with eternal salvation in the next world, and the
practice of virtue in this?The recommendation of such a mind as De
Maistre's is the intensity of its appreciation of order and social
happiness.The obvious weakness of such a mind, and the curse inherent
in its influence, is that it overlooks the prime condition of all; that
social order can never be established on a durable basis so long as the
discoveries of scientific truth in all its departments are suppressed,
or incorrectly appreciated, or socially misapplied.De Maistre did not
perceive that the cause which he supported was no longer the cause of
peace and tranquillity and right living, but was in a state of absolute
and final decomposition, and therefore was the cause of disorder and
blind wrong living.FOOTNOTES:

[7] De Maistre found a curiously characteristic kind of support for this
view in the fact that evils are called _fleaux_: flails are things to
beat with: so evils must be things with which men are beaten; and as we
should not be beaten if we did not deserve it, _argal_, suffering is a
merited punishment.Apart from that common infirmity which leads people
after they have discovered an analogy between two things, to argue from
the properties of the one to those of the other, as if, instead of being
analogous, they were identical, De Maistre was particularly fond of
inferring moral truths from etymologies.He has an argument for the
deterioration of man, drawn from the fact that the Romans expressed in
the same word, _supplicium_, the two ideas of prayer and punishment
(_Soirees, 2ieme entretien_, i. p.His profundity as an
etymologist may be gathered from his analysis of _cadaver_: _ca_-ro,
_da_-ta, _ver_-mibus.[8] _Gibbon_, c. xlvi.[9] See the _Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon_, vol.58 _et seq._




III.When the waters of the deluge of '89 began to assuage, the best minds
soon satisfied themselves that the event which Bonaparte's restoration
of order enabled them to look back upon with a certain tranquillity and
a certain completeness, had been neither more nor less than a new
irruption of barbarians into the European world.The monarchy, the
nobles, and the Church, with all the ideas that gave each of them life
and power, had fallen before atheists and Jacobins, as the ancient
empire of Rome had fallen before Huns and Goths, Vandals and Lombards.The leaders of the revolution had succeeded one another, as Attila had
come after Alaric, and as Genseric had been followed by Odoacer.The
problem which presented itself was not new in the history of western
civilisation; the same dissolution of old bonds which perplexed the
foremost men at the beginning of the nineteenth century, had distracted
their predecessors from the fifth to the eighth, though their conditions
and circumstances were widely different.The practical question in both
cases was just the same--how to establish a stable social order which,
resting on principles that should command the assent of all, might
secure the co-operation of all for its harmonious and efficient
maintenance, and might offer a firm basis for the highest and best life
that the moral and intellectual state of the time allowed.There were
two courses open, or which seemed to be open, in this gigantic
enterprise of reconstructing a society.One of them was to treat the
case of the eighteenth century as if it were not merely similar to, but
exactly identical with, the case of the fifth, and as if exactly the
same forces which had knit Western Europe together into a compact
civilisation a thousand years before, would again suffice for a second
consolidation.Christianity, rising with the zeal and strength of youth
out of the ruins of the Empire, and feudalism by the need of
self-preservation imposing a form upon the unshapen associations of the
barbarians, had between them compacted the foundations and reared the
fabric of mediaeval life.Why, many men asked themselves, should not
Christian and feudal ideas repeat their great achievement, and be the
means of reorganising the system which a blind rebellion against them
had thrown into deplorable and fatal confusion?Let the century which
had come to such an end be regarded as a mysteriously intercalated
episode, and no more, in the long drama of faith and sovereign order.Let it pass as a sombre and pestilent stream, whose fountains no man
should discover, whose waters had for a season mingled with the mightier
current of the divinely allotted destiny of the race, and had then
gathered themselves apart and flowed off, to end as they had begun, in
the stagnation and barrenness of the desert.Philosophers and men of
letters, astronomers and chemists, atheists and republicans, had shown
that they were only powerful to destroy, as the Goths and the Vandals
had been.They had shown that they were impotent, as the Goths and the
Vandals had been, in building up again.Let men turn their faces, then,
once more to that system by which in the ancient times Europe had been
delivered from a relapse into eternal night.The minds to whom it
commended itself were cast in a different mould and drew their
inspiration from other traditions.In their view the system which the
Church had been the main agency in organising, had fallen quite as much
from its own irremediable weakness as from the direct onslaughts of
assailants within and without.The barbarians had rushed in, it was
true, in 1793; but this time it was the Church and feudalism which were
in the position of the old empire on whose ruins they had built.What
had once restored order and belief to the West, was now in its own turn
overtaken by decay and dissolution.To look to them to unite these new
barbarians in a stable and vigorous civilisation, because they had
organised Europe of old, was as infatuated as it would have been to
expect the later emperors to equal the exploits of the Republic and
their greatest predecessors in the purple.To despise philosophers and
men of science was only to play over again in a new dress the very part
which Julian had enacted in the face of nascent Christianity.The
eighteenth century, instead of being that home of malaria which the
Catholic and Royalist party represented, was in truth the seed-ground of
a new and better future.Its ideas were to furnish the material and the
implements by which should be repaired the terrible breaches and chasms
in European order that had been made alike by despots and Jacobins, by
priests and atheists, by aristocrats and sans-culottes.Amidst all the
demolition upon which its leading minds had been so zealously bent, they
had been animated by the warmest love of social justice, of human
freedom, of equal rights, and by the most fervent and sincere longing to
make a nobler happiness more universally attainable by all the children
of men.It was to these great principles that we ought eagerly to turn,
to liberty, to equality, to brotherhood, if we wished to achieve before
the new invaders a work of civilisation and social reconstruction, such
as Catholicism and feudalism had achieved for the multitudinous invaders
of old.Such was the difference which divided opinion when men took heart to
survey the appalling scene of moral desolation that the cataclysm of '93
had left behind.For if the
conscience of the Liberals was oppressed by the sanguinary tragedy in
which freedom and brotherhood and justice had been consummated, the
Catholic and the Royalist were just as sorely burdened with the weight
of kingly basenesses and priestly hypocrisies.If the one had some
difficulty in interpreting Jacobinism and the Terror, the other was
still more severely pressed to interpret the fact and origin and meaning
of the Revolution; if the Liberal had Marat and Hebert, the Royalist had
Lewis XV., and the Catholic had Dubois and De Rohan.Each school could
intrepidly hurl back the taunts of its enemy, and neither of them did
full justice to the strong side of the other.Yet we who are, in England
at all events, removed a little aside from the centre of this great
battle, may perceive that at that time both of the contending hosts
fought under honourable banners, and could inscribe upon their shields a
rational and intelligible device.Indeed, unless the modern Liberal
admits the strength inherent in the cause of his enemies, it is
impossible for him to explain to himself the duration and obstinacy of
the conflict, the slow advance and occasional repulse of the host in
which he has enlisted, and the tardy progress that Liberalism has made
in that stupendous reconstruction which the Revolution has forced the
modern political thinker to meditate upon, and the modern statesman to
further and control.De Maistre, from those general ideas as to the method of the government
of the world, of which we have already seen something, had formed what
he conceived to be a perfectly satisfactory way of accounting for the
eighteenth century and its terrific climax.The will of man is left
free; he acts contrary to the will of God; and then God exacts the
shedding of blood as the penalty.The only hope of
the future lay in an immediate return to the system which God himself
had established, and in the restoration of that spiritual power which
had presided over the reconstruction of Europe in darker and more
chaotic times than even these.Though, perhaps, he nowhere expresses
himself on this point in a distinct formula, De Maistre was firmly
impressed with the idea of historic unity and continuity.He looked upon
the history of the West in its integrity, and was entirely free from
anything like that disastrous kind of misconception which makes the
English Protestant treat the long period between St.Paul and Martin
Luther as a howling waste, or which makes some Americans omit from all
account the still longer period of human effort from the crucifixion of
Christ to the Declaration of Independence.The rise of the vast
structure of Western civilisation during and after the dissolution of
the Empire, presented itself to his mind as a single and uniform
process, though marked in portions by temporary, casual, parenthetical
interruptions, due to depraved will and disordered pride.All the
dangers to which this civilisation had been exposed in its infancy and
growth were before his eyes.First, there were the heresies with which
the subtle and debased ingenuity of the Greeks had stained and distorted
the great but simple mysteries of the faith.Then came the hordes of
invaders from the North, sweeping with irresistible force over regions
that the weakness or cowardice of the wearers of the purple left
defenceless before them.Before the northern tribes had settled in their
possessions, and had full time to assimilate the faith and the
institutions which they had found there, the growing organisation was
menaced by a more deadly peril in the incessant and steady advance of
the bloody and fanatical tribes from the East.And in this way De
Maistre's mind continued the picture down to the latest days of all,
when there had arisen men who, denying God and mocking at Christ, were
bent on the destruction of the very foundations of society, and had
nothing better to offer the human race than a miserable return to a
state of nature.As he thus reproduced this long drama, one benign and central figure was
ever present, changeless in the midst of ceaseless change; laboriously
building up with preterhuman patience and preterhuman sagacity, when
other powers, one after another in evil succession, were madly raging to
destroy and to pull down; thinking only of the great interests of order
and civilisation, of which it had been constituted the eternal
protector, and showing its divine origin and inspiration alike by its
unfailing wisdom and its unfailing benevolence.It is the Sovereign
Pontiff who thus stands forth throughout the history of Europe, as the
great Demiurgus of universal civilisation.If the Pope had filled only
such a position as the Patriarch held at Constantinople, or if there had
been no Pope, and Christianity had depended exclusively on the East for
its propagation, with no great spiritual organ in the West, what would
have become of Western development?It was the energy and resolution of
the Pontiffs which resisted the heresies of the East, and preserved to
the Christian religion that plainness and intelligibility, without which
it would never have made a way to the rude understanding and simple
hearts of the barbarians from the North.It was their wise patriotism
which protected Italy against Greek oppression, and by acting the part
of mayors of the palace to the decrepit Eastern emperors, it was they
who contrived to preserve the independence and maintain the fabric of
society until the appearance of the Carlovingians, in whom, with the
rapid instinct of true statesmen, they at once recognised the founders
of a new empire of the West.If the Popes, again, had possessed over the
Eastern empire the same authority that they had over the Western, they
would have repulsed not only the Saracens, but the Turks too, and none
of the evils which these nations have inflicted on us would ever have
taken place.[10] Even as it was, when the Saracens threatened the West,
the Popes were the chief agents in organising resistance, and giving
spirit and animation to the defenders of Europe.Their alert vision saw
that to crush for ever that formidable enemy, it was not enough to
defend ourselves against his assaults; we must attack him at home.The
Crusades, vulgarly treated as the wars of a blind and superstitious
piety, were in truth wars of high policy.From the Council of Clermont
down to the famous day of Lepanto, the hand and spirit of the Pontiff
were to be traced in every part of that tremendous struggle which
prevented Europe from being handed over to the tyranny, ignorance, and
barbarism that have always been the inevitable fruits of Mahometan
conquest, and had already stamped out civilisation in Asia Minor and
Palestine and Greece, once the very garden of the universe.This admirable and politic heroism of the Popes in the face of foes
pressing from without, De Maistre found more than equalled by their
wisdom, courage, and activity in organising and developing the elements
of a civilised system within.The maxim of old societies had been that
which Lucan puts into the mouth of Caesar--_humanum paucis vivit genus_.A vast population of slaves had been one of the inevitable social
conditions of the period: the Popes never rested from their endeavours
to banish servitude from among Christian nations.Women in old
societies had filled a mean and degraded place: it was reserved for the
new spiritual power to rescue the race from that vicious circle in which
men had debased the nature of women, and women had given back all the
weakness and perversity they had received from men, and to perceive that
'the most effectual way of perfecting the man is to ennoble and exalt
the woman.'The organisation of the priesthood, again, was a masterpiece
of practical wisdom.Such an order, removed from the fierce or selfish
interests of ordinary life by the holy regulation of celibacy, and by
the austere discipline of the Church, was indispensable in the midst of
such a society as that which it was the function of the Church to guide.Who but the members of an order thus set apart, acting in strict
subordination to the central power, and so presenting a front of
unbroken spiritual unity, could have held their way among tumultuous
tribes, half-barbarous nobles, and proud and unruly kings, protesting
against wrong, passionately inculcating new and higher ideas of right,
denouncing the darkness of the false gods, calling on all men to worship
the cross and adore the mysteries of the true God?Compare now the
impotency of the Protestant missionary, squatting in gross comfort with
wife and babes among the savages he has come to convert, preaching a
disputatious doctrine, wrangling openly with the rival sent by some
other sect--compare this impotency with the success that follows the
devoted sons of the Church, impressing their proselytes with the
mysterious virtue of their continence, the self-denial of their lives,
the unity of their dogma and their rites; and then recognise the wisdom
of these great churchmen who created a priesthood after this manner in
the days when every priest was as the missionary is now.Finally, it was
the occupants of the holy chair who prepared, softened, one might almost
say sweetened, the occupants of thrones; it was to them that Providence
had confided the education of the sovereigns of Europe.The Popes
brought up the youth of the European monarchy; they made it precisely in
the same way in which Fenelon made the Duke of Burgundy.In each case
the task consisted in eradicating from a fine character an element of
ferocity that would have ruined all.'Everything that constrains a man
strengthens him.He cannot obey without perfecting himself; and by the
mere fact of overcoming himself he is better.Any man will vanquish the
most violent passion at thirty, because at five or six you have taught
him of his own will to give up a plaything or a sweetmeat.That came to
pass to the monarchy, which happens to an individual who has been well
brought up.The continued efforts of the Church, directed by the
Sovereign Pontiff, did what had never been seen before, and what will
never be seen again where that authority is not recognised.Insensibly,
without threats or laws or battles, without violence and without
resistance, the great European charter was proclaimed, not on paper nor
by the voice of public criers; but in all European hearts, then all
Catholic Kings surrender the power of judging by themselves, and nations
in return declare kings infallible and inviolable.Such is the
fundamental law of the European monarchy, and it is the work of the
Popes.'[11]

All this, however, is only the external development of De Maistre's
central idea, the historical corroboration of a truth to which he
conducts us in the first instance by general considerations.Assuming,
what it is less and less characteristic of the present century at any
rate to deny, that Christianity was the only actual force by which the
regeneration of Europe could be effected after the decline of the Roman
civilisation, he insists that, as he again and again expresses it,
'without the Pope there is no veritable Christianity.'What he meant by
this condensed form needs a little explanation, as is always the case
with such simple statements of the products of long and complex
reasoning.In saying that without the Pope there is no true
Christianity, what he considered himself as having established was, that
unless there be some supreme and independent possessor of authority to
settle doctrine, to regulate discipline, to give authentic counsel, to
apply accepted principles to disputed cases, then there can be no such
thing as a religious system which shall have power to bind the members
of a vast and not homogeneous body in the salutary bonds of a common
civilisation, nor to guide and inform an universal conscience.In each
individual state everybody admits the absolute necessity of having some
sovereign power which shall make, declare, and administer the laws, and
from whose action in any one of these aspects there shall be no appeal;
a power that shall be strong enough to protect the rights and enforce
the duties which it has authoritatively proclaimed and enjoined.In free
England, as in despotic Turkey, the privileges and obligations which the
law tolerates or imposes, and all the benefits which their existence
confers on the community, are the creatures and conditions of a supreme
authority from which there is no appeal, whether the instrument by which
this authority makes its will known be an act of parliament or a ukase.This conception of temporal sovereignty, especially familiarised to our
generation by the teaching of Austin, was carried by De Maistre into
discussions upon the limits of the Papal power with great ingenuity and
force, and, if we accept the premisses, with great success.It should be said here, that throughout his book on the Pope, De Maistre
talks of Christianity exclusively as a statesman or a publicist would
talk about it; not theologically nor spiritually, but politically and
socially.The question with which he concerns himself is the utilisation
of Christianity as a force to shape and organise a system of civilised
societies; a study of the conditions under which this utilisation had
taken place in the earlier centuries of the era; and a deduction from
them of the conditions under which we might ensure a repetition of the
process in changed modern circumstance.In the eighteenth century men
were accustomed to ask of Christianity, as Protestants always ask of so
much of Catholicism as they have dropped, whether or no it is true.But
after the Revolution the question changed, and became an inquiry whether
and how Christianity could contribute to the reconstruction of society.People asked less how true it was, than how strong it was; less how many
unquestioned dogmas, than how much social weight it had or could
develop; less as to the precise amount and form of belief that would
save a soul, than as to the way in which it might be expected to assist
the European community.It was the strength of this temper in him which led to his extraordinary
detestation and contempt for the Greeks.Their turn for pure speculation
excited all his anger.In a curious chapter, he exhausts invective in
denouncing them.[12] The sarcasm of Sallust delights him, that the
actions of Greece were very fine, _verum aliquanto minores quam fama
feruntur_.Their military glory was only a flash of about a hundred and
fourteen years from Marathon; compare this with the prolonged splendour
of Rome, France, and England.In philosophy they displayed decent
talent, but even here their true merit is to have brought the wisdom of
Asia into Europe, for they invented nothing.Greece was the home of
syllogism and of unreason.'Read Plato: at every page you will draw a
striking distinction.As often as he is Greek, he wearies you.He is
only great, sublime, penetrating, when he is a theologian; in other
words, when he is announcing positive and everlasting dogmas, free from
all quibble, and which are so clearly marked with the eastern cast, that
not to perceive it one must never have had a glimpse of Asia.... There
was in him a sophist and a theologian, or, if you choose, a Greek and a
Chaldean.'The Athenians could never pardon one of their great leaders,
all of whom fell victims in one shape or another to a temper frivolous
as that of a child, ferocious as that of men,--'_espece de moutons
enrages, toujours menes par la nature, et toujours par nature devorant
leurs bergers_.'As for their oratory, 'the tribune of Athens would have
been the disgrace of mankind if Phocion and men like him, by
occasionally ascending it before drinking the hemlock or setting out for
their place of exile, had not in some sort balanced such a mass of
loquacity, extravagance, and cruelty.'[13]

It is very important to remember this constant solicitude for ideas that
should work well, in connection with that book of De Maistre's which
has had most influence in Europe, by supplying a base for the theories
of ultramontanism.Unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his
ardent speculations on the Papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing
the practical solution of a pressing social problem, we easily
misunderstand him and underrate what he had to say.A charge has been
forcibly urged against him by an eminent English critic, for example,
that he has confounded supremacy with infallibility, than which, as the
writer truly says, no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct, one
being superiority of force, and the other incapacity of error.[14] De
Maistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this, but he
was too acute, I think, deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure
upon a confusion so very obvious, and that must have stared him in the
face from the first page of his work to the last.If we look upon his
book as a mere general defence of the Papacy, designed to investigate
and fortify all its pretensions one by one, we should have great right
to complain against having two claims so essentially divergent, treated
as though they were the same thing, or could be held in their places by
the same supports.But let us regard the treatise on the Pope not as
meant to convince free-thinkers or Protestants that divine grace
inspires every decree of the Holy Father, though that would have been
the right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier.It was
composed within the first twenty years of the present century, when the
universe, to men of De Maistre's stamp, seemed once more without form
and void.His object, as he tells us more than once, was to find a way
of restoring a religion and a morality in Europe; of giving to truth the
forces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating; of
strengthening the thrones of sovereigns, and of gently calming that
general fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any
that had yet overwhelmed society.From this point of view we shall see
that the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth
recognising.Practically, he says, 'infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy,
or rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names....
In effect it is the same thing, _in practice_, not to be subject to
error, and not to be liable to be accused of it.Thus, even if we should
agree that no divine promise was made to the Pope, he would not be less
infallible or deemed so, as the final tribunal; for every judgment from
which you cannot appeal is and must be (_est et doit etre_) held for
just in every human association, under any imaginable form of
government; and every true statesman will understand me perfectly, when
I say that the point is to ascertain not only if the Sovereign Pontiff
is, but if he must be, infallible.'[15] In another place he says
distinctly enough that the infallibility of the Church has two aspects;
in one of them it is the object of divine promise, in the other it is a
human implication, and that in the latter aspect infallibility is
supposed in the Church, just 'as we are absolutely bound to suppose it,
even in temporal sovereignties (where it does not really exist), under
pain of seeing society dissolved.'The Church only demands what other
sovereignties demand, though she has the immense superiority over them
of having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven.[16] Take away
the dogma, if you will, he says, and only consider the thing
politically, which is exactly what he really does all through the book.The pope, from this point of view, asks for no other infallibility than
that which is attributed to all sovereigns.[17] Without either
vindicating or surrendering the supernatural side of the Papal claims,
he only insists upon the political, social, or human side of it, as an
inseparable quality of an admitted supremacy.[18] In short, from
beginning to end of this speculation, from which the best kind of
ultramontanism has drawn its defence, he evinces a deprecatory
anxiety--a very rare temper with De Maistre--not to fight on the issue
of the dogma of infallibility over which Protestants and unbelievers
have won an infinite number of cheap victories; that he leaves as a
theme more fitted for the disputations of theologians.My position, he
seems to keep saying, is that if the Pope is spiritually supreme, then
he is virtually and practically _as if he were_ infallible, just in the
same sense in which the English Parliament and monarch, and the Russian
Czar, are as if they were infallible.But let us not argue so much about
this, which is only secondary.The main question is whether without the
Pope there can be a true Christianity, 'that is to say, a Christianity,
active, powerful, converting, regenerating, conquering, perfecting.'De Maistre was probably conducted to his theory by an analogy, which he
tacitly leaned upon more strongly than it could well bear, between
temporal organisation and spiritual organisation.In inchoate
communities, the momentary self-interest and the promptly stirred
passions of men would rend the growing society in pieces, unless they
were restrained by the strong hand of law in some shape or other,
written or unwritten, and administered by an authority, either
physically too strong to be resisted, or else set up by the common
consent seeking to further the general convenience.To divide this
authority, so that none should know where to look for a sovereign
decree, nor be able to ascertain the commands of sovereign law; to
embody it in the persons of many discordant expounders, each assuming
oracular weight and equal sanction; to leave individuals to administer
and interpret it for themselves, and to decide among themselves its
application to their own cases; what would this be but a deliberate
preparation for anarchy and dissolution?For it is one of the clear
conditions of the efficacy of the social union, that every member of it
should be able to know for certain the terms on which he belongs to it,
the compliances which it will insist upon in him, and the compliances
which it will in turn permit him to insist upon in others, and therefore
it is indispensable that there should be some definite and admitted
centre where this very essential knowledge should be accessible.Some such reflections as these must have been at the bottom of De
Maistre's great apology for the Papal supremacy, or at any rate they may
serve to bring before our minds with greater clearness the kind of
foundations on which his scheme rested.For law substitute Christianity,
for social union spiritual union, for legal obligations the obligations
of the faith.Instead of individuals bound together by allegiance to
common political institutions, conceive communities united in the bonds
of religious brotherhood into a sort of universal republic, under the
moderate supremacy of a supreme spiritual power.As a matter of fact, it
was the intervention of this spiritual power which restrained the
anarchy, internal and external, of the ferocious and imperfectly
organised sovereignties that figure in the early history of modern
Europe.And as a matter of theory, what could be more rational and
defensible than such an intervention made systematic, with its
rightfulness and disinterestedness universally recognised?Grant
Christianity as the spiritual basis of the life and action of modern
communities; supporting both the organised structure of each of them,
and the interdependent system composed of them all; accepted by the
individual members of each, and by the integral bodies forming the
whole.But who shall declare what the Christian doctrine is, and how its
maxims bear upon special cases, and what oracles they announce in
particular sets of circumstances?Amid the turbulence of popular
passion, in face of the crushing despotism of an insensate tyrant,
between the furious hatred of jealous nations or the violent ambition of
rival sovereigns, what likelihood would there be of either party to the
contention yielding tranquilly and promptly to any presentation of
Christian teaching made by the other, or by some suspected neutral as a
decisive authority between them?Obviously there must be some supreme
and indisputable interpreter, before whose final decree the tyrant
should quail, the flood of popular lawlessness flow back within its
accustomed banks, and contending sovereigns or jealous nations
fraternally embrace.Again, in those questions of faith and discipline,
which the ill-exercised ingenuity of men is for ever raising and
pressing upon the attention of Christendom, it is just as obvious that
there must be some tribunal to pronounce an authoritative judgment.Otherwise, each nation is torn into sects; and amid the throng of sects
where is unity?'To maintain that a crowd of independent churches form a
church, one and universal, is to maintain in other terms that all the
political governments of Europe only form a single government, one and
universal.'There could no more be a kingdom of France without a king,
nor an empire of Russia without an emperor, than there could be one
universal church without an acknowledged head.That this head must be
the successor of St.Peter, is declared alike by the voice of tradition,
the explicit testimony of the early writers, the repeated utterances of
later theologians of all schools, and that general sentiment which
presses itself upon every conscientious reader of religious history.The argument that the voice of the Church is to be sought in general
councils is absurd.To maintain that a council has any other function
than to assure and certify the Pope, when he chooses to strengthen his
judgment or to satisfy his doubts, is to destroy visible unity.Suppose
there to be an equal division of votes, as happened in the famous case
of Fenelon, and might as well happen in a general council, the doubt
would after all be solved by the final vote of the Pope.And 'what is
doubtful for twenty selected men is doubtful for the whole human race.Those who suppose that by multiplying the deliberating voices doubt is
lessened, must have very little knowledge of men, and can never have sat
in a deliberative body.'Again, supposing there to present itself one of
those questions of divine metaphysics that it is absolutely necessary to
refer to the decision of the supreme tribunal.Then our interest is not
that it should be decided in such or such a manner, but that it should
be decided without delay and without appeal.Besides, the world is now
grown too vast for general councils, which seem to be made only for the
youth of Christianity.In fine, why pursue futile or mischievous
discussions as to whether the Pope is above the Council or the Council
above the Pope?In ordinary questions in which a king is conscious of
sufficient light, he decides them himself, while the others in which he
is not conscious of this light, he transfers to the States-General
presided over by himself, but he is equally sovereign in either case.Let us be content to know, in the words
of Thomassin,[19] that 'the Pope in the midst of his Council is above
himself, and that the Council decapitated of its chief is below him.'The point so constantly dwelt upon by Bossuet, the obligation of the
canons upon the Pope, was of very little worth in De Maistre's judgment,
and he almost speaks with disrespect of the great Catholic defender for
being so prolix and pertinacious in elaborating it.Here again he finds
in Thomassin the most concise statement of what he held to be the true
view, just as he does in the controversy as to the relative superiority
of the Pope or the Council.'There is only an apparent contradiction,'
says Thomassin, 'between saying that the Pope is above the canons, and
that he is bound by them; that he is master of the canons, or that he is
not.Those who place him above the canons or make him their master, only
pretend that he _has a dispensing power over them_; while those who deny
that he is above the canons or is their master, mean no more than that
_he can only exercise a dispensing power for the convenience and in the
necessities of the Church_.'This is an excellent illustration of the
thoroughly political temper in which De Maistre treats the whole
subject.He looks at the power of the Pope over the canons much as a
modern English statesman looks at the question of the coronation oath,
and the extent to which it binds the monarch to the maintenance of the
laws existing at the time of its imposition.In the same spirit he
banishes from all account the crowd of nonsensical objections to Papal
supremacy, drawn from imaginary possibilities.Suppose a Pope, for
example, were to abolish all the canons at a single stroke; suppose him
to become an unbeliever; suppose him to go mad; and so forth.'Why,' De
Maistre says, 'there is not in the whole world a single power in a
condition to bear all possible and arbitrary hypotheses of this sort;
and if you judge them by what they can do, without speaking of what they
have done, they will have to be abolished every one.'[20] This, it may
be worth noticing, is one of the many passages in De Maistre's writings
which, both in the solidity of their argument and the direct force of
their expression, recall his great predecessor in the anti-revolutionary
cause, the ever-illustrious Burke.The vigour with which De Maistre sums up all these pleas for supremacy
is very remarkable; and to the crowd of enemies and indifferents, and
especially to the statesmen who are among them, he appeals with
admirable energy.Do you mean that the nations
should live without any religion, and do you not begin to perceive that
a religion there must be?And does not Christianity, not only by its
intrinsic worth but because it is in possession, strike you as
preferable to every other?Have you been better contented with other
attempts in this way?Peradventure the twelve apostles might please you
better than the Theophilanthropists and Martinists?Does the Sermon on
the Mount seem to you a passable code of morals?And if the entire
people were to regulate their conduct on this model, should you be
content?I fancy that I hear you reply affirmatively.Well, since the
only object now is to maintain this religion for which you thus declare
your preference, how could you have, I do not say the stupidity, but the
cruelty, to turn it into a democracy, and to place this precious deposit
in the hands of the rabble?'You attach too much importance to the dogmatic part of this religion.By what strange contradiction would you desire to agitate the universe
for some academic quibble, for miserable wranglings about mere words
(these are your own terms)?Will you
call the Bishop of Quebec and the Bishop of Lucon to interpret a line of
the Catechism?That believers should quarrel about infallibility is what
I know, for I see it; but that statesmen should quarrel in the same way
about this great privilege, is what I shall never be able to
conceive.... That all the bishops in the world should be convoked to
determine a divine truth necessary to salvation--nothing more natural,
if such a method is indispensable; for no effort, no trouble, ought to
be spared for so exalted an aim.But if the only point is the
establishment of one opinion in the place of another, then the
travelling expenses of even one single Infallible are sheer waste.If
you want to spare the two most valuable things on earth, time and money,
make all haste to write to Rome, in order to procure thence a lawful
decision which shall declare the unlawful doubt.Nothing more is needed;
policy asks no more.'[21]

Definitely, then, the influence of the Popes restored to their ancient
supremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social
order resting on the Christian faith, somewhat after this manner.The
anarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples, having failed to do
anything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience
do not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion,
would be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the
Holy See.Do not suppose that the Revolution is at an end, or that the
column is replaced because it is raised up from the ground.A man must
be blind not to see that all the sovereignties in Europe are growing
weak; on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them; sects
and the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an
appalling manner.There are only two alternatives: you must either
purify the will of men, or else you must enchain it; the monarch who
will not do the first, must enslave his subjects or perish; servitude or
spiritual unity is the only choice open to nations.On the one hand is
the gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled
Imperialism, and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of
temporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and
accepted spiritual power.No middle path lies before the people of
Europe.Temporal absolutism we must have.The only question is whether
or no it shall be modified by the wise, disinterested, and moderating
counsels of the Church, as given by her consecrated chief.*       *       *       *       *

There can be very little doubt that the effective way in which De
Maistre propounded and vindicated this theory made a deep impression on
the mind of Comte.Very early in his career this eminent man had
declared: 'De Maistre has for me the peculiar property of helping me to
estimate the philosophic capacity of people, by the repute in which they
hold him.'Among his other reasons at that time for thinking well of M.
Guizot was that, notwithstanding his transcendent Protestantism, he
complied with the test of appreciating De Maistre.[22] Comte's rapidly
assimilative intelligence perceived that here at last there was a
definite, consistent, and intelligible scheme for the reorganisation of
European society, with him the great end of philosophic endeavour.Its
principle of the division of the spiritual and temporal powers, and of
the relation that ought to subsist between the two, was the base of
Comte's own scheme.In general form the plans of social reconstruction are identical; in
substance, it need scarcely be said, the differences are fundamental.The temporal power, according to Comte's design, is to reside with
industrial chiefs, and the spiritual power to rest upon a doctrine
scientifically established.De Maistre, on the other hand, believed that
the old authority of kings and Christian pontiffs was divine, and any
attempt to supersede it in either case would have seemed to him as
desperate as it seemed impious.In his strange speculation on _Le
Principe Generateur des Constitutions Politiques_, he contends that all
laws in the true sense of the word (which by the way happens to be
decidedly an arbitrary and exclusive sense) are of supernatural origin,
and that the only persons whom we have any right to call legislators,
are those half-divine men who appear mysteriously in the early history
of nations, and counterparts to whom we never meet in later days.Elsewhere he maintains to the same effect, that royal families in the
true sense of the word 'are growths of nature, and differ from others,
as a tree differs from a shrub.'People suppose a family to be royal because it reigns; on the contrary,
it reigns because it is royal, because it has more life, _plus d'esprit
royal_--surely as mysterious and occult a force as the _virtus
dormitiva_ of opium.The common life of man is about thirty years; the
average duration of the reigns of European sovereigns, being Christian,
is at the very lowest calculation twenty.How is it possible that 'lives
should be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five,
if princes had not more common life than other men?'Mark again, the
influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties.All the
Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient
and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns.The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years
before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and
those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure
of seventeen.Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear
to have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with
rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising.As a matter
of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and
there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the
universe in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a
Protestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view
being true.Many differences among the people who hold to the
theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the
different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the
intervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the
ground by a special and direct energy of the divine will, up to those
at the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation
ended when the universe was once fairly launched.De Maistre was of
those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times.If, then,
Protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had
provided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be
likely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their
backslidings, with the curse of shortness of days?In a trenchant passage De Maistre has expounded the Protestant
confession of faith, and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an
interpretation of the dealings of God with man.'By virtue of a terrible
anathema,' he supposes the Protestant to say, 'inexplicable no doubt,
but much less inexplicable than incontestable, the human race lost all
its rights.Plunged in mortal darkness, it was ignorant of all, since it
was ignorant of God; and, being ignorant of him, it could not pray to
him, so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life.Arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement, it
outraged nature by its manners, its laws, even by its religions.It
consecrated all vices, it wallowed in filth, and its depravation was
such that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture, which it
is not good for all men so much as to look upon.God, however, _having
dissembled for forty centuries_, bethought him of his creation.At the
appointed moment announced from all time, he did not despise a virgin's
womb; he clothed himself in our unhappy nature, and appeared on the
earth; we saw him, we touched him, he spoke to us; he lived, he taught,
he suffered, he died for us.He arose from his tomb according to his
promise; he appeared again among us, solemnly to assure to his Church a
succour that would last as long as the world.'But, alas, this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from
securing all the success that had been foretold.For lack of knowledge,
or of strength, or by distraction maybe, God missed his aim, and could
not keep his word.Less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut
up ether in canvas or paper, he only confided to men the truth that he
had brought upon the earth; it escaped, then, as one might have
foreseen, by all human pores; soon, this holy religion revealed to man
by the Man-God, became no more than an infamous idolatry, which would
remain to this very moment if Christianity after sixteen centuries had
not been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of
sorry creatures.'[23]

Perhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in
an equally irrational aspect.If you measure the proceedings of
omnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put
such superhuman power, if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with
it, De Maistre's theory of the extent to which a supreme being
interferes in human things, is after all only a degree less ridiculous
and illogical, less inadequate and abundantly assailable, than that
Protestantism which he so heartily despised.Would it be difficult,
after borrowing the account, which we have just read, of the tremendous
efforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon
the world, to perplex the Catholic as bitterly as the Protestant, by
confronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those
efforts, and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost
agencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces
practically spent?*       *       *       *       *

De Maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a
defender of the old order.If anybody could rationalise the idea of
supernatural intervention in human affairs, the idea of a Papal
supremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and
intellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social
need of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do
it.In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the
hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now.The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that
many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction.Legitimacy
and the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the
Revolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone
together, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power.Fifty
years have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive
decay in the principles which then were triumphant.It was not,
therefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against
believing '_que la colonne est replacee, parcequ'elle est relevee_.'The
solution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself
desperate and impossible.Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to
millions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment,
and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on
dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the
daily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its
existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the
preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or
indirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history
for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of
men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of
Catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent
that ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves
into maintaining or accepting.Over the modern invader it is as
powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old.The barbarians of
industrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest
or pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with
blind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help.Christianity,
according to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the
religion of Christ remains to be tried.One would prefer to qualify the
first clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe
even with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure
within the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its
founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human
sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting
men together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which
it is unnecessary to discuss here.'_They talk about the first centuries
of Christianity_,' said De Maistre, '_I would not be sure that they are
over yet_.'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,
it is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so
different from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve
another name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the
achievement of renewing society, De Maistre's ideal of a spiritual power
controlling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their
rulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little
chance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,
with a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on
which the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly
carried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern
civilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,
or at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination
or nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the
consciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost
hand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is
supreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is
an idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public
opinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all
other spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose
of their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De
Maistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre's mind was of the highest type of those who fill
the air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions
of the metaphysical stage of thought.At every point you meet the
peremptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological
property of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the
will of God; and the kings reign because they have the _esprit royal_.Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,
not historic.These differences in method and point of view amply
explain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who
look upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible
road to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the
positive generalisations of experience.There can be no more
satisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these
ancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the
willingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how
indispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can
best appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their
aspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why
their aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an
anachronism.FOOTNOTES:

[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the
Isaurian whose repulse of the Caliph's forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of
Charles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay's
_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.'The Greeks,' he
says, 'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical
controversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these
controversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the
natives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,
and polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight
examination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the
heresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more
profound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the
opinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the
mental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,
and had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.'--_Byzantine Empire,
from 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that 'the religious or
theological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is
really Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and
theoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the
work of the Latin Church.'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[16] _Ib._ bk.[17] _Ib._ bk.[18] '_Il n'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et
pour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans
l'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est
toujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle

pas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c'est la meme chose
DANS LA PRATIQUE, d'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the
middle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings
generally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or
doctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on
the Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to
the Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked
the Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the
decrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the
Church had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be
thought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l'Eglise_ in the twentieth
chapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *

End of Project Gutenberg's Critical Miscellanies (Vol.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.To others the ghosts of the men they had lately murdered, appeared
menacing them with fearful retribution.As the day advanced, and they had to some extent recovered their
spirits by the aid of their favorite stimulants, they attempted to
laugh the matter off as a mere bugbear created by an imagination over
heated by too great an indulgence in strong drink.Although this opinion was not shared by Captain Flint, who had
carefully abstained from over-indulgence, for reasons of his own, he
encouraged it in his men.But even they, while considering it necessary to remain quiet for a
few days, to see whether or not, any harm should result to them, in
consequence of their late attack on the merchant ship, none of them
showed a disposition to pass another night in the cave.Captain Flint made no objection to his men remaining outside on the
following night, as it would give him the opportunity to investigate
the matter, which he desired.On the next night, when there was no one in the cavern but himself and
the two who usually occupied it, he called Lightfoot to him, and asked
her if she had ever heard any strange noises in the place before."Sometime heard de voices of the Indian braves dat gone to the spirit
land," said the woman."Did you ever hear anything like the groan we heard last night?""Tink him de voice ob the great bad spirit," was the reply.Captain Flint, finding that he was not likely to learn anything in
this quarter that would unravel the mystery, now called the <DW64>."Bill," he said, "did you ever hear that noise before?""When you trow my--"

"Hold your tongue, you black scoundrel, or I'll break every bone in
your body!"roared his master, cutting off the boy's sentence in the
middle.The boy was going to say:

"When you trow'd my fadder into the sea."The captain now examined every portion of the cavern, to see if he
could discover anything that could account for the production of the
strange sound.In every part he tried his voice, to see if he could produce those
remarkable echoes, which had so startled him, on the previous night,
but without success.The walls, in various parts of the cavern, gave back echoes, but
nothing like those of the previous night.There were two recesses in opposite sides of the cave.The larger one
of these was occupied by Lightfoot as a sleeping apartment.The other,
which was much smaller, Black Bill made use of for the same purpose.From these two recesses, the captain had everything removed, in order
that he might subject them to a careful examination.He tried his voice here, as in other parts of the cavern, but the
walls gave back no unusual echoes.He was completely baffled, and, placing his lamp on the table, he sat
down on one of the seats, to meditate on what course next to pursue.Lightfoot and Bill soon after, at his request, retired.He had been seated, he could not tell how long, with his head resting
on his hands, when he was aroused by a yell more fearful, if possible,
even than the groan that had so alarmed him on the previous night.The yell was repeated in the same horrible and mysterious manner that
the groan had been.Flint sprang to his feet while the echoes were still ringing in his
ears, and rushed to the sleeping apartment, first, to that of the
Indian woman, and then, to that of the <DW64>.They both seemed to be sound asleep, to all appearance, utterly
unconscious of the fearful racket that was going on around them.Captain Flint, more perplexed and bewildered than ever, resumed his
seat by the table; but not to sleep again that night, though the
fearful yell was not repeated.The captain prided himself on being perfectly free from all
superstition.He held in contempt the stories of ghosts of murdered men coming back
to torment their murderers.In fact, he was very much inclined to disbelieve in any hereafter at
all, taking it to be only an invention of cunning priests, for the
purpose of extorting money out of their silly dupes.But here was
something, which, if not explained away, would go far to stagger his
disbelief.He was glad that the last exhibition had only been witnessed by
himself, and that the men for the present preferred passing their
nights outside; for, as he learned from Lightfoot, the noises were
only during the night time.This would enable him to continue his investigation without any
interference on the part of the crew, whom he wished to keep in utter
ignorance of what he was doing, until he had perfectly unraveled the
mystery.For this purpose, he gave Lightfoot and Black Bill strict charges not
to inform the men of what had taken place during the night.He was determined to pass the principal portion of the day in sleep,
so as to be wide awake when the time should come for him to resume his
investigations.On the day after the first scene in the cave, late in the afternoon,
three men sat on the deck of the schooner, as she lay in the shadow of
forest covered mountain.These were Jones Bradley, Old Ropes, and the man who went by the name
of the Parson.They were discussing the occurrences of the previous
night."I'm very much of the captains opinion," said the Parson, "that the
noises are caused by the wind rushing through the chinks and crevices
of the rocks.""Yes; but, then, there wan't no wind to speak of, and how is the wind
to make that horrible groan, s'pose it did blow a hurricane?""Just so," said Old Ropes; "that notion about the wind makin' such a
noise at that, is all bosh.My opinion is, that it was the voice of a
spirit.I know that the captain laughs at all such things, but all his
laughin' don't amount to much with one that's seen spirits."you don't mean to say that you ever actually see a live ghost?""That's jist what I do mean to say," replied Old Ropes."Hadn't you been takin' a leetle too much, or wasn't the liquor too
strong?""Well, you may make as much fun about it as you please," said Old
Ropes; "but I tell you, that was the voice of a spirit, and, what's
more, I believe it's either the spirit of some one that's been
murdered in that cave, by some gang that's held it before, and buried
the body over the treasure they've stowed away there, or else the
ghost of some one's that's had foul play from the captain.""Well," said the Parson, "if I thought there was any treasure there
worth lookin' after, all the ghosts you could scare up wouldn't hinder
me from trying to get at it.""But, no matter about that; you say you see a live ghost once."I suppose," said Old Ropes, "that there aint no satisfaction in a
feller's tellin' of things that aint no credit to him; but,
howsomever, I might as well tell this, as, after all, it's only in the
line of our business."You must know, then, that some five years ago, I shipped on board a
brig engaged in the same business that our craft is."I needn't tell you of all the battles we were in, and all the prizes
we made; but the richest prize that ever come in our way, was a
Spanish vessel coming from Mexico, With a large amount of gold and
silver on board."We attacked the ship, expecting to make an easy prize of her, but we
were disappointed."The Spaniards showed fight, and gave us a tarnal sight of trouble."This made our captain terrible wrothy.He swore that every soul that
remained alive on the captured vessel should be put to death."Now, it so happened that the wife and child (an infant,) of the
captain of the Spanish vessel, were on board.When the others had all
been disposed of, the men plead for the lives of these two.But our
captain would not listen to it; but he would let us cast lots to see
which of us would perform the unpleasant office."As bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me."It must be done; so, the plank was got ready.She took the baby in
her arms, stepped upon the plank, as I ordered her, and the next
moment, she, with the child in her arms, sank to rise no more; but the
look she gave me, as she went down, I shall never forget."It haunts me yet, and many and many is the time that Spanish woman,
with the child in her arms, has appeared to me, fixing upon me the
same look that she gave me, as she sank in the sea."Luck left us from that time; we never took a prize afterwards."Our Vessel was captured by a Spanish cruiser soon afterwards.I, with
one other, succeeded in making our escape."The captain, and all the rest, who were not killed in the battle,
were strung out on the yard-arm.""I suppose that's because she's a Spaniard, and thinks you don't
understand her language," remarked the Parson, sneeringly."I wonder
why this ghost of the cave don't show himself, and not try to frighten
us with his horrible boo-wooing.""Well, you may make as much fun as you please," replied Old Ropes;
"but, mark my words for it, if the captain don't pay attention to the
warning he has had, that ghost will show himself in a way that won't
be agreeable to any of us.""If he takes my advice, he'll leave the cave, and take up his quarters
somewhere else."you don't mean to say you're afraid!""Put an enemy before me in the shape of flesh and blood, and I'll show
you whether I'm afeard, or not," said Old Ropes; "but this fighting
with dead men's another affair.Lead and
steel wont reach 'em, and the very sight on 'em takes the pluck out of
a man, whether he will or no."An enemy of real flesh and blood, when he does kill you, stabs you or
shoots you down at once, and there's an end of it; but, these ghosts
have a way of killing you by inches, without giving a fellow a chance
to pay them back anything in return.""It's pretty clear, anway, that they're a 'tarnal set of cowards,"
remarked the Parson."The biggest coward's the bravest men, when there's no danger,"
retorted Old Ropes.To this, the Parson made no reply, thinking, probably, that he had
carried the joke far enough, and not wishing to provoke a quarrel with
his companion."As to the affair of the cave," said Jones Bradley; "I think very much
as Old Ropes does about it.I'm opposed to troubling the dead, and I
believe there's them buried there that don't want to be disturbed by
us, and if we don't mind the warning they give us, still the worse for
us.""The captain don't seem to be very much alarmed about it," said the
Parson; "for he stays in the cave.And, then, there's the Indian woman
and the darkey; the ghost don't seem to trouble them much.""I'll say this for Captain Flint," remarked Old Ropes, "if ever I
knowed a man that feared neither man nor devil, that man is Captain
Flint; but his time'll come yet.""You don't mean to say you see breakers ahead, do you?""Not in the way of our business, I don't mean," said Ropes; "but, I've
had a pretty long experience in this profession, and have seen the
finishing up of a good many of my shipmates; and I never know'd one
that had long experience, that would not tell you that he had been put
more in fear by the dead than ever he had by the living.""We all seem to be put in low spirits by this afternoon," said the
Parson; "s'pose we go below, and take a little something to cheer us
up."To this the others assented, and all three went below.All Captain Flint's efforts to unravel the mysteries of the cave were
unsuccessful; and he was reluctantly obliged to give up the attempt,
at least for the present; but, in order to quiet the minds of the
crew, he told them that he had discovered the cause, and that it was
just what he had supposed it to be.As everything remained quiet in the cave for a long time after this,
and the minds of the men were occupied with more important matters,
the excitement caused by it wore off; and, in a while, the affair
seemed to be almost forgotten.And here we may as well go back a little in our narrative, and restore
the chain where it was broken off a few chapters back.When Captain Flint had purchased the schooner which he commanded, it
was with the professed object of using her as a vessel to trade with
the Indians up the rivers, and along the shore, and with the various
seaports upon the coast.To this trade it is true, he did to some extent apply himself, but
only so far as it might serve as a cloak to his secret and more
dishonorable and dishonest practices.Had Flint been disposed to confine himself to the calling he pretended
to follow, he might have made a handsome fortune in a short time, but
that would not have suited the corrupt and desperate character of the
man.He was like one of those wild animals which having once tasted blood,
have ever afterward an insatiable craving for it.It soon became known to a few of the merchants in the city, among the
rest Carl Rosenthrall, that Captain Flint had added to his regular
business, that of smuggling.This knowledge, however, being confined to those who shared the
profits with him, was not likely to be used to his disadvantage.After a while the whole country was put into a state of alarm by the
report that a desperate pirate had appeared on the coast.Several vessels which had been expected to arrive with rich cargoes
had not made their appearance, although the time for their arrival had
long passed.There was every reason to fear that they had been
captured by this desperate stranger who had sunk them, killing all on
board.The captain of some vessels which had arrived in safety reported
having been followed by a suspicious looking craft.They said she was a schooner about the size of one commanded by
Captain Flint, but rather longer, having higher masts and carrying
more sail.No one appeared to be more excited on the subject of the pirate, than
Captain Flint.He declared that he had seen the mysterious vessel, had
been chased by her, and had only escaped by his superior sailing.Several vessels had been fitted out expressly for the purpose of
capturing this daring stranger, but all to no purpose; nothing could
be seen of her.For a long time she would seem to absent herself from the coast, and
vessels would come and go in safety.Then all of a sudden, she would
appear again and several vessels would be missing, and never heard
from more.The last occurrence of this kind is the one which we have already
given an account of the capturing and sinking of the vessel in which
young Billings had taken passage for Europe.We have already seen how Hellena Rosenthrall's having accidentally
discovered her lover's ring on the finger of Captain Flint, had
excited suspicions of the merchant's daughter, and what happened to
her in consequence.Captain Flint having made it the interest of Rosenthrall to keep his
suspicions to himself if he still adhered to them, endeavored to
convince him that his daughter was mistaken, and that the ring however
much it might resemble the one belonging to her lover, was one which
had been given to him by his own mother at her death, and had been
worn by her as long as he could remember.This explanation satisfied, or seemed to satisfy the merchant, and the
two men appeared to be as good friends as ever again.The sudden and strange disappearance of the daughter of a person of so
much consequence as Carl Rosenthrall, would cause no little excitement
in a place no larger than New York was at the time of which we write.Most of the people agreed in the opinion with the merchant that the
girl had been carried off by the Indian Fire Cloud, in order to avenge
himself for the insult he had received years before.As we have seen,
Captain Flint encouraged this opinion, and promised that in an
expedition he was about fitting out for the Indian country, he would
make the recovery of the young woman one of his special objects.Flint knew all the while where Fire Cloud was to be found, and fearing
that he might come to the city ignorant as he was of the suspicion he
was laboring under, and thereby expose the double game he was playing,
he determined to visit the Indian in secret, under pretence of putting
him on his guard, but in reality for the purpose of saving himself.He sought out the old chief accordingly, and warned him of his danger.Fire Cloud was greatly enraged to think that he should be suspected
carrying off the young woman."He hated her father," he said, "for he was a cheat, and had a crooked
tongue.But the paleface maiden was his friend, and for her sake he
would find her if she was among his people, and would restore her to
her friends.""If you enter the city of the palefaces, they will hang you up like a
dog without listening to anything you have to say in your defence,"
said Flint."The next time Fire Cloud enters the city of the palefaces, the maiden
shall accompany him," replied the Indian.This was the sort of an answer that Flint wished, and expected, and he
now saw that there was no danger to be apprehended from that quarter.But if Captain Flint felt himself relieved from danger in this
quarter, things looked rather squally in another.If he knew how to
disguise his vessel by putting on a false bow so as to make her look
longer, and lengthen the masts so as to make her carry more sail, he
was not the only one who understood these tricks.And one old sailor
whose bark had been chased by the strange schooner, declared that she
very much resembled Captain Flint's schooner disguised in this way.And then it was observed that the strange craft was never seen when
the captain's vessel was lying in port, or when she was known to be up
the river where he was trading among the Indians.Another suspicious circumstance was, that shortly after the strange
disappearance of a merchant vessel, Flint's schooner came into port
with her rigging considerably damaged, as if she had suffered from
some unusual cause.Flint accounted for it by saying that he had been
fired into by the pirate, and had just escaped with the skin of his
teeth.These suspicions were at first spoken cautiously, and in whispers
only, by a very few.They came to the ears of Flint himself at last, who seeing the danger
immediately set about taking measures to counteract it by meeting and
repelling, what he pretended to consider base slanders invented by his
enemies for the purpose of effecting his ruin.He threatened to prosecute the slanderers, and if they wished to see
how much of a pirate he was, let them fit out a vessel such as he
would describe, arm her, and man her according to his directions, give
him command of her, and if he didn't bring that blasted pirate into
port he'd never return to it himself.He'd like no better fun than to
meet her on equal terms, in an open sea.This bragadocia had the desired effect for awhile; besides, although
it could hardly be said that Flint had any real friends, yet there
were so many influential men who were concerned with him in some of
his contraband transactions.These dreaded the exposure to themselves,
should Flint's real character be discovered, which caused them to
answer for him in the place of friends.These men would no doubt be the first to crush him, could they only do
so without involving themselves in his ruin.But all this helped to convince Flint that his time in this part of
the country was pretty near up, and if he meant to continue in his
present line of business, he must look out for some new field of
operations.More than ever satisfied on this point, Captain Flint anxiously
awaited the arrival of the vessel, the capture of which was to be the
finishing stroke of his operations in this part of the world.When Captain Flint had decided to take possession of the cavern, and
fit it up as a place of retreat and concealment for himself and his
gang, he saw the necessity of having some one whom he could trust to
take charge of the place in his absence.A moment's reflection
satisfied him there was no one who would be more likely to serve him
in this capacity than the Indian woman who had rescued him from the
fearful fate he had just escaped.Lightfoot, who in her simplicity, looked upon him as a great chief,
was flattered by the proposal which he made her, and immediately took
charge of the establishment, and Captain Flint soon found that he had
no reason to repent the choice he had made, so far as fidelity to his
interests was concerned.For a while at first he treated her with as much kindness as it was in
the nature of such as he to treat any one.He may possibly have felt some gratitude for the service she had
rendered him, but it was self-interest more than any other feeling
that caused him to do all in his power to gain a controling influence
over her.He loaded her with presents of a character suited to her uncultivated
taste.Her person fairly glittered with beads, and jewelry of the most gaudy
character, while of shawls and blankets of the most glaring colors,
she had more than she knew what to do with.This course he pursued until he fancied he had completely won her
affection, and he could safely show himself in his true character
without the risk of loosing his influence over her.His manner to her now changed, and he commenced treating her more as a
slave than an equal, or one to whom he felt himself under obligations.It is true he would now and then treat her as formerly, and would
occasionally make her rich presents, but it would be done in the way
that the master would bestow a favor on a servant.Lightfoot bore this unkind treatment for some time without resenting
it, or appearing to notice it.Thinking perhaps that it was only a
freak of ill-humor that would last but for a short time, and then the
great chiefs attachment would return.Flint fancied that he had won the heart of the Indian woman, and
acting on the presumption that "love is blind," he thought that he
could do as he pleased without loosing hold on her affections.He had only captured the woman's
fancy.So that when Lightfoot found this altered manner of the captain's
towards her was not caused by a mere freak of humor, but was only his
true character showing itself, her fondness for him, if fondness it
could be called, began to cool.Things had come to this pass, when Hellena Rosenthrall was brought
into the cave.The first thought of Lightfoot was that she had now discovered the
cause of the captain's change of manner towards her.He had found
another object on which to lavish his favors and here was her rival.And she was to be the servant, the slave of this new favorite.Flint, in leaving Hellena in charge of Lightfoot, gave strict charges
that she should be treated with every attention, but that she should
by no means be allowed to leave the cave.The manner of Lightfoot to Hellena, was at first sullen: and reserved,
and although she paid her all the attention that Hellena required of
her, she went no further.But after awhile, noticing the sad countenance of her paleface sister,
and that her face was frequently bathed in tears, her heart softened
toward her, and she ventured to ask the cause of her sorrow.And when
she had heard Hellena's story, her feelings towards her underwent an
entire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot
pledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make
her take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so
without endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since
her capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in
the person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be
perfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,
his admiration for her could hardly have been greater.He could not
keep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though
generally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,
as to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts
of kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black
Bill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the
narrative.When it was finished, and Hellena's eyes were filled with
tears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:

"Don't cry, don't cry misses, de debble's comin arter massa Flint
berry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de
white angel."This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the
<DW64>, expressed as it was in such a strange manner, brought a smile
to the face of the maiden, notwithstanding the affliction which was
crushing her to the earth."Why Bill," said Hellena, "you don't mean to say you ever saw the
devil here, do you?""Never seed him, but heer'd him doe, sometimes," replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means
free from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and
witches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of
considerable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:

"I hope there ain't any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.""No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to
Hellena) or Lightfoot," said the Indian woman."The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of
spirits come back here sometimes.""Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime," replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, "are they not my friends?"Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena's curiosity, as well as her fears
were excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,
commenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to
the cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:

She said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had
put foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land
for a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a
great nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in
the bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough
to contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not
utterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for
bravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted
as much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land
was overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was
because they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to
them in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal
chiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit
would speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,
every thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said
he would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him
that they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if
he persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and
told them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great
Spirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose
of frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a
great brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to
him, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country
of all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his
own, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then
he laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into
the magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to
say.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came
out sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,
and his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation
scattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.But by
this time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united
against him as a common enemy.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste, as
theirs had been laid waste before.And the war was carried on for many years, until the prophesy was
fulfilled that had been spoken by the Great Spirit, and the people of
this once mighty nation were scattered to the four winds.This people as a great nation are known no longer, but a remnant still
remains scattered among the other tribes.Occasionally some of them
visit this cave, to whom alone its mysteries are known, or were,
Lightfoot said, until she had brought Captain Flint there in order to
escape their pursuers."Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard
there since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the
spirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back
from the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the
friends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of
Hellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a
dreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to
her imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly
be placed in.CHAPTER X.


When there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of
Lightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the
cavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night
following the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad
history of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl's sleep would be very
sound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob
goblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking
over the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and
expecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its
appearance in the shape of an enormous Indian in his war paint, and
his hands reeking with blood.After a while she fell into a doze in which she had a horrid dream,
where all the things she had been thinking of appeared and took form,
but assuming shapes ten times more horrible than any her waking
imagination could possibly have created.She had started from one of these horrid dreams,
and afraid to go to sleep again, lay quietly gazing around the cavern
on the ever varying reflections cast by the myriads of crystals that
glittered upon the wall and ceiling.Although there were in some portions of the cavern walls chinks or
crevices which let in air, and during some portion of the day a few
straggling sunbeams, it was found necessary even during the day to
keep a lamp constantly burning.And the one standing on the table in
the centre of the cave was never allowed to go out.As we have said, Hellena lay awake gazing about her.A perfect stillness reigned in the cave, broken only by the rather
heavy breathing of the Indian woman who slept soundly.Suddenly she heard, or thought she heard a slight grating noise at the
further side of the cavern.or does she actually
see the wall of the cavern parting?Such actually seems to be the
case, and from the opening out steps a figure dressed like an Indian,
and bearing in his hand a blazing torch.Hellena's tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth, and her limbs are
paralyzed with terror.The figure moves about the room with a step as noiseless as the step
of the dead, while the crystals on the walls seem to be set in motion,
and to blaze with unnatural brilliancy as his torch is carried from
place to place.He carefully examines everything as he proceeds; particularly the
weapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take
his fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined
it.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and
gazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white
maiden.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as
stealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and
everything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences
of the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed
were real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.The horrible
spectres which she had seen in the fore part of the night seemed like
those which visit us in our dreams when our minds are troubled.But
the apparition of the Indian seemed more real.or were the two
scenes only different parts of one waking vision?To this last opinion she seemed most inclined, and was fully confirmed
in the opinion that the cavern was haunted.Although Hellena was satisfied in her own mind that the figure that
had appeared so strangely was a disembodied spirit, yet she had a
vague impression that she had somewhere seen that form before.But
when, or where, she could not recollect.When in the morning she related the occurrences of the night to
Lightfoot, the Indian expressed no surprise, and exhibited no alarm.Nor did she attempt to offer any explanation seeming to treat it as a
matter of course.Although this might be unsatisfactory to Hellena in some respects, it
was perhaps after all, quite as well for her that Lightfoot did not
exhibit any alarm at what had occurred, as by doing so she imparted
some of her own confidence to her more timid companion.All this while Black Bill had not been thought of but after a while he
crawled out from his bunk, his eyes twice their usual size, and coming
up to Hellena, he said:

"Misses, misses, I seed do debble last night wid a great fire-brand in
his hand, and he went all round de cabe, lookin' for massa Flint, to
burn him up, but he couldn't fine him so he went away agin.Now I know
he's comin' after massa Flint, cause he didn't touch nobody else.""No; but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at
me, but he didn't say noffen, so I know'd it wasn't dis darkey he was
after."This statement of the <DW64>'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been
dreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the
horrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took
a lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could
discover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass
through, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing
like what she was in search of.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any
other entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had
entered.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that
she might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the
dark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following
day, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous
night, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as
something called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story
made up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Or perhaps invented for the purpose of arousing his superstition in
order to make him leave the cave, and take her to some place where
escape would be more easy.So she concluded to say nothing to him about it.About a week after the occurrence of the events recorded in the last
chapter, Captain Flint and his crew were again assembled in the
cavern.It was past midnight, and they evidently had business of
importance before them, for although the table was spread as upon the
former occasion, the liquors appeared as yet to be untasted, and
instead of being seated around the table, the whole party were sitting
on skins in a remote corner of the cavern, and conversing in a
suppressed tone of voice as if fearful of being heard."Something must be done," said one of the men, "to quiet this darn
suspicion, or it's all up with us.""I am for leaving at once," said Old Ropes; "the only safety for us
now is in giving our friends the slip, and the sooner we are out of
these waters the better it will be for us.""What, and leave the grand prize expecting to take care of itself?""Darn the prize," said Old Ropes, "the East Indiaman ain't expected
this two weeks yet, and if the suspicions agin us keep on increasin'
as they have for the last ten days, the land pirates'll have us all
strung up afore the vessel arrives."This opinion was shared by the majority of the men.Even the Parson
who took delight in opposing Old Ropes in almost every thing, agreed
with him here."Whether or not," said he, "I am afraid to face death in a fair
business-like way, you all know, but as sure as I'm a genuine parson,
I'd rather be tortured to death by a band of savage Indians, than to
be strung up to a post with my feet dangling in the air to please a
set of gaping fools.""Things do look rather squally on shore, I admit," said the captain,
"but I've hit upon a plan to remedy all that, and one that will make
us pass for honest men, if not saints, long enough to enable us to
finish the little job we have on hand.""Why, merely to make a few captures while we are lying quietly in the
harbour or a little way up the river.That'll turn the attention of
the people from us in another direction, in the mean while, we can
bide our time."We must man a whale boat or two and
attack some one of the small trading vessels that are coming in every
day.She must be run on the rocks where she may be examined
afterwards, so that any one may see that she has falling in the hands
of pirates.None of the crew must be allowed to escape, as that would
expose the trick."All this must take place while I am known to be on shore, and the
schooner lying in port."This plot, which was worthy the invention of a fiend, was approved by
all but Jones Bradley who declared that he would have nothing to do
with it.For which disobedience of orders he would have probably been
put to death had he been at sea.The plan of operations having been decided upon, the whole party
seated themselves round the table for the purpose as they would say of
making a night of it.But somehow or other they seemed to be in no humor for enjoyment, as
enjoyment is understood by such characters.A gloom seemed to have settled on the whole party.They could not even get their spirits up, by pouring spirits down.And although they drank freely, they drank for the most part in
silence.shouted captain Flint, "at last have we all lost our
voices?Can no one favor us with a song, or toast or a yarn?"Hardly had these words passed the lips of the captain, when the
piteous moan which had so startled the pirates, on the previous
evening again saluted them, but in a more suppressed tone of voice.The last faint murmurs of this moan had not yet died away, when a
shout, or rather a yell like an Indian war whoop, rang through the
cavern in a voice that made the very walls tremble, its thousand
echoes rolling away like distant thunder.The whole group sprang to their feet aghast.The two woman followed by Black Bill, terror stricken, joined the
group.This at least might be said of Hellena and the <DW64>.The latter
clinging to the skirts of the white maiden for protection, as a mortal
in the midst of demons might be supposed to seek the protection of an
Angel.Captain Flint, now laying his hand violently on Lightfoot, said, "What
does all this mean?do you expect to frighten me by your juggling
tricks, you infernal squaw?"At these words he gave her a push that
sent her staggering to the floor.In a moment he saw his mistake, and went to her assistance (but she
had risen before he reached her,) and endeavored to conciliate her
with kind words and presents.He took a gold chain from his pocket, and threw it about her neck, and
drew a gold ring from his own finger and placed it upon hers.These attentions she received in moody silence.All this was done by Flint, not from any feelings of remorse for the
injustice he had done the woman, but from a knowledge of how much he
was in her power and how dangerous her enmity might be to him.Finding that she was not disposed to listen to him, he turned from her
muttering to himself:

"She'll come round all right by and by," and then addressing his men
said:

"Boys, we must look into this matter; there's something about this
cave we don't understand yet.There may be another one over it, or
under it.He did not repeat the explanation he had given before, feeling no
doubt, that it would be of no use.A careful examination of the walls of the cave were made by the whole
party, but to no purpose.Nothing was discovered that could throw any
light upon the mystery, and they were obliged to give it up.And thus they were compelled to let the matter rest for the present.When the morning came, the pirates all left with the exception of the
captain, who remained, he said, for the purpose of making further
investigations, but quite as much for the purpose of endeavoring to
find out whether or not, Lightfoot had anything to do with the
production of the strange noises.But here again, he was fated to
disappointment.The Indian could not, or would not, give any
satisfactory explanation.The noises she contended were made by the braves of her nation who had
gone to the spirit world, and who were angry because their sacred
cavern had been profaned by the presence of the hated palefaces.Had he consulted Hellena, or Black Bill, his investigations would
probably have taken a different turn.The figure of the Indian having been seen by both Hellena and the
black, would have excited his curiosity if not his fears, and led him
to look upon it as a more serious matter than he had heretofore
supposed.But he did not consult either of them, probably supposing them to be a
couple of silly individuals whose opinions were not worth having.If any doubt had remained in the minds of the men in regard to the
supernatural character of the noises which had startled them in the
cave, they existed no longer.Even the Parson although generally ridiculing the idea of all sorts of
ghosts and hobgoblins, admitted that there was something in this
affair that staggered him, and he joined with the others in thinking
that the sooner they shifted their quarters, the better."Don't you think that squaw had a hand in it?"asked one of the men:
"didn't you notice how cool she took it all the while?""That's a fact," said the Parson; "it's strange I didn't think of that
before.I shouldn't wonder if it wasn't after all, a plot contrived by
her and some of her red-skinned brethren to frighten us out of the
cave, and get hold of the plunder we've got stowed away there."Some of the men now fell in with this opinion, and were for putting it
to the proof by torturing Lightfoot until she confessed her guilt.The majority of the men, however, adhered to the original opinion that
the whole thing was supernatural, and that the more they meddled with
it, the deeper they'd get themselves into trouble."My opinion is," said Old Ropes, "that there's treasure buried there,
and the whole thing's under a charm, cave, mountain, and all.""If there's treasure buried there," said the Parson, "I'm for having a
share of it.""The only way to get treasure that's under charm," said Old Ropes, "is
to break the charm that binds it, by a stronger charm.""It would take some blasting to get at treasure buried in that solid
rock," said Jones Bradley."If we could only break the charm that holds the treasure, just as
like as not that solid rock would all turn into quicksand," replied
Old Ropes."No; but I've seen them as has," replied Old Ropes."And more than that," continued Old Ropes, "my belief is that Captain
Flint is of the same opinion, though he didn't like to say so."I shouldn't wonder now, if he hadn't some charm he was tryin', and
that was the reason why he stayed in the cave so much.""I rather guess the charm that keeps the captain so much in the cave
is a putty face," dryly remarked one of the men.While these things had been going on at the cavern, and Captain Flint
had been pretending to use his influence with the Indians for the
recovery of Hellena, Carl Rosenthrall himself had not been idle in the
meantime.He had dealings with Indians of the various tribes along the river,
and many from the Far North, and West, and he engaged them to make
diligent search for his daughter among their people, offering tempting
rewards to any who would restore her, or even tell him to a certainty,
where she was to be found.In order to induce Fire Cloud to restore her in case it should prove
it was he who was holding her in captivity, he sent word to that
chief, that if he would restore his child, he would not only not have
him punished, but would load him with presents.These offers, of course made through Captain Flint, who it was
supposed by Rosenthrall, had more opportunities than any one else of
communicating with the old chief.How likely they would have been to reach the chief, even if he had
been the real culprit, the reader can guess.In fact he had done all in his power to impress the Indian that to put
himself in the power of Rosenthrall, would be certain death to him.Thus more than a month passed without bringing to the distracted
father any tidings of his missing child.We may as well remark here, that Rosenthrall had lost his wife many
years before, and that Hellena was his only child, so that in losing
her he felt that he had lost everything.The Indians whom he had employed to aid him in his search, informed
him that they could learn nothing of his daughter among their people,
and some of them who were acquainted with Fire Cloud, told him that
the old chief protested he knew nothing of the matter.Could it be that Flint was playing him false?He could hardly think that it was Flint himself who had stolen his
child, for what motive could he have in doing it?The more he endeavored to unravel the mystery, the stranger and more
mysterious it became.Notwithstanding the statements to the contrary made by the Indians,
Flint persisted in giving it as his belief, that Fire Cloud had
carried off the girl and was still holding her a prisoner.He even
said that the chief had admitted as much to him.Yet he was sure that
if he was allowed to manage the affair in his own way, he should be
able to bring the Indian to terms.It was about this time that the dark suspicions began to be whispered
about that Captain Flint was in some way connected with the horrible
piracies that had recently been perpetrated on the coast, if he were
not in reality the leader of the desperate gang himself, by whom they
had been perpetrated.Those suspicions as we have seen, coming to Flint's own ears, had
caused him to plan another project still more horrible than the one he
was pursuing, in order to quiet those suspicions until he should have
an opportunity of capturing the rich prize which was to be the
finishing stroke to his achievements in this part of the world.The suspicions in regard to Captain Flint had reached the ears of
Rosenthrall, as well as others, who had been secretly concerned with
him in his smuggling transactions, although in no way mixed up with
his piracies.Rosenthrall feared that in case these suspicions against Flint should
lead to his arrest, the whole matter would come out and be exposed,
leading to the disgrace if not the ruin, of all concerned.It was therefore with a feeling of relief, while joining in the
general expression of horror, that he heard of a most terrible piracy
having been committed on the coast.Captain Flint's vessel was lying
in port, and he was known to be in the city.There was one thing too connected with this affair that seemed to
prove conclusively, that the suspicions heretofore harboured against
the captain were unjust.And that was the report brought by the crew of a fishing smack, that
they had seen a schooner answering to the description given of the
pirate, just before this horrible occurrence took place.Captain Flint now assumed the bearing of a man whose fair fame had
been purified of some foul blot stain that had been unjustly cast upon
it, one who had been honorably acquitted of base charges brought
against him by enemies who had sought his ruin.He had not been ignorant, he said, of the dark suspicions that had
been thrown out against him.But he had trusted to time to vindicate his character, and he had not
trusted in vain.Among the first to congratulate Captain Flint on his escape from the
danger with which he had been threatened, was Carl Rosenthrall.He admitted that he had been to some extent, tainted with suspicion,
in common with others, for which he now asked his forgiveness.The pardon was of course granted by the captain, coupled with hope
that he would not be so easily led away another time.The facts in regard to this last diabolical act of the pirates were
these.Captain Flint, in accordance with the plan which he had decided upon,
and with which the reader has already been made acquainted, fitted out
a small fishing vessel, manned by some of the most desperate of his
crew, and commanded by the Parson and Old Ropes.Most of the men went on board secretly at night, only three men
appearing on deck when she set sail.In fact, no one to look at her, would take her for anything but an
ordinary fishing smack.They had not been out long, before they came in sight of a vessel
which they thought would answer their purpose.It was a small brig
engaged in trading along the coast, and such a vessel as under
ordinary circumstances they would hardly think worth noticing.But
their object was not plunder this time, but simply to do something
that would shield them from the danger that threatened them on shore.The time seemed to favor them, for the night was closing in and there
were no other vessels in sight.On the pirates making a signal of distress, the commander of the brig
brought his vessel to, until the boat from the supposed smack could
reach him, and the crew could make their wants known.To his surprise six men fully armed sprang upon his deck.To resist this force there were only himself, and two men, all
unarmed.Of these the pirates made short work not deigning to answer the
questions put to them by their unfortunate victims.When they had murdered all on board, and thrown overboard such of the
cargo as they did not want they abandoned the brig, knowing from the
direction of the wind, and the state of the tide, that she would soon
drift on the beach, and the condition in which she would be found,
would lead people to believe that she had been boarded by pirates, and
all on board put to death.After having accomplished this hellish act, they turned their course
homeward, bringing the report that they had seen the notorious
piratical schooner which had committed so many horrible depredations,
leading every one to conclude that this was another of her terrible
deeds.Captain Flint, satisfied with the result of this last achievement,
felt himself secure for the present.He could now without fear of interruption, take time to mature his
plans for carrying out his next grand enterprise, which was to be the
crowning one of all his adventures, and which was to enrich all
engaged in it.Captain Flint's plan for the accomplishment of his last grand
enterprise was, as soon as it should be announced to him by those he
had constantly on the lookout, that the expected vessel was in sight,
to embark in a large whale boat which he had secretly armed, and
fitted for the purpose.After killing the crew of the vessel they expected to capture, he
would tack about ship, and take her into some port where he could
dispose of the vessel and cargo.As, in this case, it was his intention to abandon the country for
ever, he removed under various pretences, all his most valuable
property from the cavern.The schooner he was to leave in charge of Jones Bradley, under
pretence that it was necessary to do so, in order to divert suspicion
from him when the thing should have been accomplished.The fact was, that as he should have no further use for the schooner,
and having for some time past, feared that Bradley seemed to be too
tender-hearted to answer his purpose, he had determined to abandon him
and the schooner together.At last, news was brought to Captain Flint that a vessel answering the
one they were expecting was in sight.Flint who, with his crew of desperators, was lying at a place now
known as Sandy Hook, immediately started in pursuit.The doomed ship was making her
way under a light breeze apparently unconscious of danger.There was one thing about the ship, that struck the pirates as rather
unusual.There seemed to be more hands on board than were required to
man such a vessel."I'm afraid there's more work for us than we've bargained for," said
one of the men."They seem to have a few passengers on board," remarked Flint, "but we
can soon dispose of them."The principal part of Flint's men had stretched themselves on the
bottom of the boat for fear of exciting the suspicion of those on
board the ship by their numbers.As the pirate craft approached the merchant man, apparently with no
hostile intention, those on board the ship were watching the boat as
closely as they were themselves watched.As soon as they came within hailing distance, the man at the bow of
the boat notified the captain of the ship that he wished to come along
side, as he had something of importance to communicate.The captain of the ship commenced apparently making preparations to
receive the visit, when one of the men on deck who had been observing
the boat for some time came to him and said:

"That's he.The man on the bow of the
boat is the notorious pirate Flint."In a moment more they would be along side, and nothing could prevent
them from boarding the ship.In that moment the captain of the ship, by a skilful movement suddenly
tacked his vessel about just as the pirates came up, coming in contact
with the boat in such a manner as to split her in two in a moment.A dozen men sprung up from the bottom of the boat, uttering horrid
curses while they endeavored to reach the ship or cling to portions of
their shattered boat.The greater portion of them were drowned, as no efforts were made to
rescue them.Three only succeeded in reaching the deck of the ship in safety, and
these would probably have rather followed their comrades had they
known how few were going to escape.These three were Captain Flint, the one called the Parson and Old
Ropes.These were at first disposed to show fight, but it was of no use.Their arms had been lost in their struggle in the water.They were soon overpowered and put in irons.Great was the excitement caused in the goodly little City of New York,
by the arrival of the merchant ship bringing as prisoners, the daring
pirate with two of his men whose fearful deeds had caused all the
inhabitants of the land to thrill with horror.And great was the surprise of the citizens to find in that terrible
pirate a well-known member of the community, and one whom nearly all
regarded as a worthy member of society.Another cause of surprise to the good people of the city, was the
arrival by this vessel, of one whom all had long given up as lost, and
that was Henry Billings, the lover of Hellena Rosenthrall.He it was who had recognized in the commander of the whale boat, the
pirate Flint, and had warned the captain of the ship of his danger,
thereby enabling him to save his vessel, and the lives of all on
board.Captain Flint made a slight mistake when he took the vessel by which
he was run down, for the India man he was looking out for.It was an
ordinary merchant ship from Amsterdam, freighted with merchandise from
that port.Though in appearance she very much resembled the vessel
which Captain Flint had taken her for.The reason young Billings happened to be on board of her was this:

It will be remembered that when the ship in which Billings had taken
passage for Europe, was attacked by the pirates, he was forced to walk
the plank.By the pirates, he was of course supposed to have been drowned, but in
this they were mistaken.He had been in the water but a few moments
when he came in contact with a portion of a spar which had probably
come from some wreck or had been washed off of some vessel.To this he lashed himself with a large handkerchief which it was his
good fortune to have at the time.Lashed to this spar he passed the night.When morning came he found that he had drifted out to sea; he could
not tell how far.He was out of sight of land, and no sail met his anxious gaze.His strength was nearly exhausted, and he felt a stupor coming over
him.How long he lay in this condition he could not tell.When he came to
himself, he found that he was lying in the birth of a vessel, while a
sailor was standing at his side.He had been discovered by the Captain of a ship bound for England,
from Boston.He had been taken on board, in an almost lifeless condition, and
kindly cared for.In a little while he recovered his usual strength, and although his
return home must necessarily be delayed, he trusted to be enabled
before a great while to do so and bring to justice the villains who
had attempted his murder.Unfortunately the vessel by which he had been rescued, was wrecked on
the coast of Ireland, he and the crew barely escaping with their
lives.After a while, he succeeded in getting to England by working his
passage there.From London, he made his way in the same manner, to Amsterdam, where
the mercantile house with which he was connected being known, he found
no difficulty in securing a passage for New York.Billings now for the first time heard the story of Hellena's
mysterious disappearance.It immediately occurred to him that Captain Flint was some way
concerned in the affair not withstanding his positive denial that he
knew anything of the matter further than he had already made known.The capture of Captain Flint, and the other two pirates of course led
to the arrest of Jones Bradley who had been left in charge of the
schooner.He was found on board of the vessel, which was lying a short distance
up the river, and arrested before he had learned the fate of his
comrades.He was cast into prison with the rest, though each occupied a separate
cell.As no good reason could be given for delaying the punishment of the
prisoners, their trial was commenced immediately.The evidence against them was too clear to make a long trial
necessary.They were all condemned to death with the exception of Jones Bradley,
whose punishment on account of his not engaged in last affair, and
having recommended mercy in the case of Henry Billings, was committed
to imprisonment for life.When the time came for the carrying out of sentence of the three who
had been condemned to death, it was found that one of them was missing
and that one, the greatest villain of them all, Captain Flint himself!No one had visited him on the previous
day but Carl Rosenthrall, and he was a magistrate, and surely he would
be the last one to aid in the escape of a prisoner!That he was gone however, was a fact.But If it were a fact that he had made his escape, it was equally
true, that he could not have gone very far, and the community were not
in the humor to let such a desperate character as he was now known to
be, escape without making a strenuous effort to recapture him.The execution of the two who had been sentenced to die at the same
time, was delayed for a few days in the hope of learning from them,
the places where Flint would most probably fly to, but they maintained
a sullen silence on the subject.They then applied to Jones Bradley with, at first, no better result.But when Henry Billings, who was one of those appointed to visit him,
happened to allude to the strange fate of Hellena Rosenthrall, he
hesitated a moment, and then said he knew where the girl was, and that
she had been captured by Captain Flint, and kept in close confinement
by him.He had no wish he said to betray his old commander, though he knew
that he had been treated badly by him, but he would like to save the
young woman.Captain Flint might be in the same place, but if he was, he thought
that he would kill the girl sooner than give her up.If Captain Flint, was not there, the only ones in the cave besides the
girl, were a squaw, and Captain Flint's <DW64> boy, Bill.For the sake of the girl Bradley said he would guide a party to the
cave.This offer was at once accepted, and a party well armed, headed by
young Billings, and guided by Jones Bradley, set out immediately.When Captain Flint made his escape from prison, it naturally enough
occurred to him, that the safest place for him for awhile, would be
the cave.In it he thought he could remain in perfect safety, until he should
find an opportunity for leaving the country.The cave, or at least the secret chamber, was unknown to any except
his crew, and those who were confined in it.On leaving the cave, the last time, with a heartlessness worthy a
demon, he had barred the entrance to the cavern on the outside, so as
to render it impossible for those confined there to escape in that
direction.In fact, he had, be supposed, buried them alive--left them to die of
hunger.Captain Flint reached the entrance of the cave in safety, and found
everything as he had left it.On reaching the inner chamber where he had left the two women and the
<DW64> boy, he was startled to find the place apparently deserted,
while all was in total darkness, except where a few rays found their
way through the crevices of the rocks.He called the names first of one, and then another, but the only
answer he received was the echo of his own voice.They certainly could not have made their escape, for the fastenings
were all as he had left them.The means of striking fire were at hand, and a lamp was soon lighted.He searched the cave, but could discover no trace of the missing ones.A strange horror came over him, such as he had never felt before.The stillness oppressed him; no living enemy could have inspired him
with the fear he now felt from being alone in this gloomy cavern."I must leave this place," he said, "I would rather be in prison than
here."Again he took up the lamp, and went round the cave, but more this time
in hopes of finding some weapon to defend himself with, in case he
should be attacked, than with the hope of discovering the manner in
which those he had left there had contrived to make their escape.It had been his custom, lately, on leaving the cavern, to take his
weapons with him, not knowing what use might be made of them by the
women under the provocation, to which they were sometimes subjected.The only weapon he could find was a large dagger.This he secured, and
was preparing to leave the cavern, when he thought he saw something
moving in one corner.In order to make sure that he had not been mistaken, he approached the
place.It was a corner where a quantity of skins had been thrown, and which
it had not been convenient for him to remove, when he left the cavern.Thinking that one of these skins might be of service to him in the
life he would be obliged to live for some time, he commenced sorting
them over, for the purpose of finding one that would answer his
purpose, when a figure suddenly sprang up from the pile.It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more frightened."Dat you, massa," at length exclaimed the familiar voice of Black
Bill."I tought it was de debil come back agin to carry me off."said Flint, greatly relieved, and glad to
find some one who could explain the strange disappearance of Hellena
and Lightfoot.he asked; "where's the white girl and the
Indian woman?""Debble carry dim off," said Bill."What do you mean, you black fool?"said his master; "if you don't
tell me where they've gone, I'll break your black skull for you.""Don't know where dar gone," said Bill, tremblingly, "Only know dat de
debble take dem away."Flint finding that he was not likely to get anything out of the boy by
frightening him, now changed his manner, saying;

"Never mind, Bill, let's hear all about it."The boy reassured, now told his master that the night before while he
was lying awake near the pile of skins and the women were asleep, he
saw the walls of the cavern divide and a figure holding a blazing
torch such as he had never seen before, enter the room."I tought," said Bill, "dat it was de debble comin' arter you agin,
massa, and I was 'fraid he would take me along, so I crawled under de
skins, but I made a hole so dat I could watch what he was doin'.""He looked all round a spell for you, massa, an' when he couldn't find
you, den he went were de women was sleepin' an woke dem up and made
dem follow him."Den da called me and looked all ober for me an' couldn't find me, an'
de debble said he couldn't wait no longer, an' dat he would come for
me annudder time, An den de walls opened agin, an' da all went true
togedder.When I heard you in de cave, massa, I tought it was de
debble come agin to fetch me, an' so I crawled under de skins agin."From this statement of the boy, Flint come to the conclusion that Bill
must have been too much frightened at the time to know what was
actually taking place.One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had
been aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most
strange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the
same result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass
out through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,
for he found everything as he had left it.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled
and disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell
of enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in
the manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was
telling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even
though a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the
feeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon
entering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,
before taking his departure.This determination of Captain Flint's was by no means agreeable to the
<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the
clutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him
that he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the
captain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of
the cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day
passed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his
appearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the
cave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and
not to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,
however, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it
at all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no
disposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards
him, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much
longer, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go
in search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the
others to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was
barred against her from the outside.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of
the captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they
immediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by
that means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,
and endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold
ring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain
Flint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look
at it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by
her lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was
satisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden
disappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this
villain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now
desirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time
before sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when
Hellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure
she had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a
spectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, "has the little paleface
maiden forgotten; no, no!"she recognized in the intruder, her old
friend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing
her arms around the old chief, exclaimed:

"Save me, no, no, save me!"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the
appearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she
had expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a
place of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in
charge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And
she recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He
was also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with
all the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and
bade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for
the first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to
perish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was
called to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go
without him, the chief promising to return and make another search for
him, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under
the pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might
be called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,
and stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a
sudden pressure, when a portion of the wall moved aside, disclosing a
passage, till then unknown to all except Fire Cloud himself.It was
one of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the
purpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed
after him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could
not see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over
the difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path
widening until it might be called another cavern, and then again
becoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they
suddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter's wand could
open the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the
passage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower
part, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and
making an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves
in the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one
unacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking
rock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the
mountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of
Indian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his
own hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find
herself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white
face to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a
stranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found
herself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling
himself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately
escaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to
persuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for
passing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in
sleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern
was the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would
certainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this
he would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him
also, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the
loud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast
asleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had
thrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the
captain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the
table, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards
the entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,
and the fastening could be easily removed.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit
of boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may
come arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain't a goun to ketch
dis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de
sea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might
be overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further
into the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the
devil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his
slumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a
crevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as
we have said had been carried off by the <DW64>."Hello, there, Bill, you black imp," shouted the captain, "bring a
light."But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times
repeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he
always kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place
of the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought
to have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in
silence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy
place, once more came over him."Who knows," he thought, "but this black imp may betray me into the
hands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his
power to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on
the outside, bury me alive!"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the
cavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard
the sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in
order to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,
who seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man
his old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the
cave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and
reconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of
everything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,
when Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, "So it's you, you
traitor, who has betrayed me," at the same moment plunging his dagger
in the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several
shots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the
advantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon
hidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident
that his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the
unfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,
and they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them
stumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang
Black Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had
discovered that he was among friends."Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?""Gone dat way, and a-runnin' as if de debble was arter him, an' I
guess he is, too."The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a
precipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low
growl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to
shrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were
in pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from
wounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?"De debble got him now," said Black Bill, and the whole party took
their way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in
company with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to
their coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the
devil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,
that they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his
mind not to return to the city, until he had learned something
definite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages
belonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had
come up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,
for the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,
occupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of
canoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt
to avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the
savages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to
trade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced
endeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their
astonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their
prisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their
course down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke
English tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that
he was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape
they had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and
they thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as
to bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of
their mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was
of no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently
his arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they
had made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for
having performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and
reproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And
Billings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left
for him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of
success were greatly against him this time, on account of the time
that had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this
delay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,
now came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing
maiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the
streams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while
traveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was
gladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered
to accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the
protection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must
travel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under
such a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian
country, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred
worth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the
remainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was
the residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father
of Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure
and disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted
in the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was
answered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of
his Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a
single canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of
Old Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man
somewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian
woman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,
Lightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,
but not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or
otherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being
delayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have
saved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her
father and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never
expected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena's happiness would now have been complete, had it
not been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled
by without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was
fast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the
one for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her
wonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did
we not think that justice to the reader, required that we should
explain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet
accounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she
had seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but
we have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so
alarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a
recess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>'s bed, there was a deep
fissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,
to amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,
when to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and
over, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,
which came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the
wall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of
times, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed
it to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, "The debil comin' after master," and repeated it a
great many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had
been talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,
Bill was lying awake, listening to the captain's story.When he came
to the part where he describes the throwing the boy's father
overboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the
crevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in
his memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had
learned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm
was caused by Fire Cloud after his visit to the cave on the occasion
that he had been taken for the devil by Bill, and an Indian ghost by
Hellena.Fire Cloud had remained in another chamber of the cavern connected
with the secret passage already described, and where the echo was even
more wonderful than the one pronounced from the opening through which
the <DW64> had spoken.Here he could hear all that was passing in the great chamber occupied
by the pirates, and from this chamber the echoes were to those who did
not understand their cause, perfectly frightful.All these peculiarities of the cavern had been known to the ancient
Indian priests or medicine men, and by them made use of to impose on
their ignorant followers.BEADLE'S FRONTIER SERIES


    1.Wapawkaneta, or the Rangers of the Oneida.Scar-Cheek, the Wild Half-Breed.Red Rattlesnake, The Pawnee.THE ARTHUR WESTBROOK CO.Cleveland, U.S.A.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
