“And I want to go,” she adds, looking round at Dick, her bright face
flushed with exercise, and her brown hair flying behind her like a
veritable little Amazon.Dick knows by sore experience that when
this little lady wants her own way she usually gets it.“Your pa said,” he mutters; but it is all of no avail, and they
continue their course by the river bank.The cottage stands with its back to the river, the mill, now idle and
unused, is built alongside.Once on a day this same mill was a busy
enough place, now it is falling to decay for lack of use, and no sign
or sound either there or at the cottage testify to the whereabouts of
the lonely inhabitant.An enormous brindled cat is mewing upon the
doorstep, a couple of gaunt hens and a bedraggled cock are pacing the
deserted gardens, while from a lean-to outhouse comes the unmistakable
grunt of a pig.“He’s not at home,” he mutters.“I’m just as glad, for your pa would
have been mighty angry with me.Somewhere not far off he’ll be, I
reckon, and up to no good.Come along, Miss Ruby; we’d better be
getting home, or the mistress’ll be wondering what’s come over you.”

They are riding homewards by the river’s bank, when they come upon a
curious figure.An old, old man, bent almost double under his load of
<DW19>s, his red handkerchief tied three cornered-wise beneath his chin
to protect his ancient head from the blazing sun.The face which looks
out at them from beneath this strange head-gear is yellow and wizened,
and the once keen blue eyes are dim and bleared, yet withal there is a
sort of low cunning about the whole countenance which sends a sudden
shiver to Ruby’s heart, and prompts Dick to touch up both ponies with
that convenient switch of his so smartly as to cause even lethargic
Smuttie to break into a canter.“Who is he?” Ruby asks in a half-frightened whisper as they slacken
pace again.She looks over her shoulder as she asks the question.The old man is standing just as they left him, gazing after them
through a flood of golden light.“He’s an old wicked one!” he mutters.“That’s him, Miss Ruby, him as we
were speaking about, old Davis, as stole your pa’s sheep.Your pa would
have had him put in prison, but that he was such an old one.He’s a bad
lot though, so he is.”

“He’s got a horrid face.I don’t like his face one bit,” says Ruby.Her
own face is very white as she speaks, and her brown eyes ablaze.“I
wish we hadn’t seen him,” shivers the little girl, as they set their
faces homewards.[Illustration]

CHAPTER IV.“I kissed thee when I went away
    On thy sweet eyes--thy lips that smiled.I heard thee lisp thy baby lore--
    Thou wouldst not learn the word farewell.God’s angels guard thee evermore,
    Till in His heaven we meet and dwell!”

                               HANS ANDERSON.It is stilly night, and she is
standing down by the creek, watching the dance and play of the water
over the stones on its way to the river.All around her the moonlight
is streaming, kissing the limpid water into silver, and in the deep
blue of the sky the stars are twinkling like gems on the robe of the
great King.Not a sound can the little girl hear save the gentle murmur of the
stream over the stones.All the world--the white, white, moon-radiant
world--seems to be sleeping save Ruby; she alone is awake.Stranger than all, though she is all alone, the child feels no sense of
dread.She is content to stand there, watching the moon-kissed stream
rushing by, her only companions those ever-watchful lights of heaven,
the stars.Faint music is sounding in her ears, music so faint and far away that
it almost seems to come from the streets of the Golden City, where the
redeemed sing the “new song” of the Lamb through an endless day.Ruby
strains her ears to catch the notes echoing through the still night in
faint far-off cadence.Nearer, ever nearer, it comes; clearer, ever clearer, ring those glad
strains of joy, till, with a great, glorious rush they seem to flood
the whole world:

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

“It’s on Jack’s card!” Ruby cannot help exclaiming; but the words die
away upon her lips.Gazing upwards, she sees such a blaze of glory as almost seems to blind
her.Strangely enough the thought that this is only a dream, and the
attendant necessity of pinching, do not occur to Ruby just now.She is gazing upwards in awestruck wonder to the shining sky.What is
this vision of fair faces, angel faces, hovering above her, faces
shining with a light which “never was on land or sea,” the radiance
from their snowy wings striking athwart the gloom?And in great, glorious unison the grand old Christmas carol rings
forth--

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

Open-eyed and awestruck, the little girl stands gazing upwards, a
wonder fraught with strange beauty at her heart.Can it be possible
that one of those bright-faced angels may be the mother whom Ruby never
knew, sent from the far-off land to bear the Christmas message to the
child who never missed a mother’s love because she never knew it?“Oh, mamma,” cries poor Ruby, stretching appealing hands up to the
shining throng, “take me with you!Take me with you back to heaven!”

She hardly knows why the words rise to her lips.Heaven has never been
a very real place to this little girl, although her mother is there;
the far-off city, with its pearly gates and golden streets, holds but
a shadowy place in Ruby’s heart, and before to-night she has never
greatly desired to enter therein.The life of the present has claimed all her attention, and, amidst
the joys and pleasures of to-day, the coming life has held but little
place.But now, with heaven’s glories almost opened before her, with
the “new song” of the blessed in her ears, with her own long-lost
mother so near, Ruby would fain be gone.Slowly the glory fades away, the angel faces grow dimmer and dimmer,
the heavenly music dies into silence, and the world is calm and hushed
as before.Still Ruby stands gazing upwards, longing for the angel
visitants to come again.But no heavenly light illumines the sky, only
the pale radiance of the moon, and no sound breaks upon the child’s
listening ear save the monotonous music of the ever-flowing water.With a disappointed little sigh, Ruby brings her gaze back to earth
again.The white moonlight is flooding the country for miles around,
and in its light the ringed trees in the cleared space about the
station stand up gaunt and tall like watchful sentinels over this
home in the lonely bush.Yet Ruby has no desire to retrace her steps
homewards.It may be that the angel host with their wondrous song will
come again.So the child lingers, throwing little pebbles in the brook,
and watching the miniature circles widen and widen, brightened to
limpid silver in the sheeny light.A halting footstep makes her turn her head.There, a few paces away,
a bent figure is coming wearifully along, weighted down beneath its
bundle of <DW19>s.Near Ruby it stumbles and falls, the <DW19>s
rolling from the wearied back down to the creek, where, caught by a
boulder, they swing this way and that in the flowing water.Involuntarily the child gives a step forward, then springs back with
a sudden shiver.“It’s the wicked old one,” she whispers.“And I
_couldn’t_ help him!Oh, I _couldn’t_ help him!”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Faint and far away is the echo,
yet full of meaning to the child’s heart.She gives a backward glance
over her shoulder at the fallen old man.He is groping with his hands
this way and that, as though in darkness, and the blood is flowing from
a cut in the ugly yellow wizened face.“If it wasn’t _him_,” Ruby mutters.“If it was anybody else but the
wicked old one; but I can’t be kind to _him_.”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Clearer and clearer rings out
the angel benison, sent from the gates of heaven, where Ruby’s mother
waits to welcome home again the husband and child from whose loving
arms she was so soon called away.To be “kind,” that is what Ruby has
decided “good will” means.Is she, then, being kind, to the old man
whose groping hands appeal so vainly to her aid?“Dad wouldn’t like me to,” decides Ruby, trying to stifle the voice of
conscience.“And he’s _such_ a horrid old man.”

Clearer and still clearer, higher and still higher rings out the
angels’ singing.There is a queer sort of tugging going on at Ruby’s
heart.She knows she ought to go back to help old Davis and yet she
cannot--cannot!Then a great flash of light comes before her eyes, and Ruby suddenly
wakens to find herself in her own little bed, the white curtains drawn
closely to ward off mosquitoes, and the morning sun slanting in and
forming a long golden bar on the opposite curtain.The little girl rubs her eyes and stares about her.She, who has so
often even doubted reality, finds it hard to believe that what has
passed is really a dream.Even yet the angel voices seem to be sounding
in her ears, the heavenly light dazzling her eyes.“And they weren’t angels, after all,” murmurs Ruby in a disappointed
voice.“It was only a dream.”

Only a dream!How many of our so-called realities are “only a dream,”
from which we waken with disappointed hearts and saddened eyes.One far
day there will come to us that which is not a dream, but a reality,
which can never pass away, and we shall awaken in heaven’s morning,
being “satisfied.”

“Dad,” asks Ruby as they go about the station that morning, she hanging
on her father’s arm, “what was my mamma like--my own mamma, I mean?”

The big man smiles, and looks down into the eager little face uplifted
to his own.“Your own mamma, little woman,” he repeats gently.of course you don’t remember her.You remind me of her, Ruby, in a
great many ways, and it is my greatest wish that you grow up just such
a woman as your dear mother was.I
don’t think you ever asked me about your mother before.”

“I just wondered,” says Ruby.She is gazing up into the cloudless blue
of the sky, which has figured so vividly in her dream of last night.“I
wish I remembered her,” Ruby murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.“Poor little lassie!” says the father, patting the small hand.“Her
greatest sorrow was in leaving you, Ruby.You were just a baby when she
died.Not long before she went away she spoke about you, her little
girl whom she was so unwilling to leave.‘Tell my little Ruby,’ she
said, ‘that I shall be waiting for her.I have prayed to the dear Lord
Jesus that she may be one of those whom He gathers that day when He
comes to make up His jewels.’ She used to call you her little jewel,
Ruby.”

“And my name means a jewel,” says Ruby, looking up into her father’s
face with big, wondering brown eyes.The dream mother has come nearer
to her little girl during those last few minutes than she has ever
done before.Those words, spoken so long ago, have made Ruby feel her
long-dead young mother to be a real personality, albeit separated from
the little girl for whom one far day she had prayed that Christ might
number her among His jewels.In that fair city, “into which no foe can
enter, and from which no friend can ever pass away,” Ruby’s mother has
done with all care and sorrow.God Himself has wiped away all tears
from her eyes for ever.Ruby goes about with a very sober little face that morning.She gathers
fresh flowers for the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses
across the courtyard to the kitchen to wash them out.This is one of
Ruby’s customary little duties.She has a variety of such small tasks
which fill up the early hours of the morning.After this Ruby usually
conscientiously learns a few lessons, which her step-mother hears her
recite now and then, as the humour seizes her.But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in honour of Christmas,
holidays which the little girl has decided shall last a month or more,
if she can possibly manage it.“You’re very quiet to-day, Ruby,” observes her step-mother, as the
child goes about the room, placing the vases of flowers in their
accustomed places.Thorne is reclining upon her favourite sofa,
the latest new book which the station affords in her hand.“Aren’t you
well, child?” she asks.“Am I quiet?” Ruby says.“I didn’t notice, mamma.I’m all right.”

It is true, as the little girl has said, that she has not even noticed
that she is more quiet than usual.Involuntarily her thoughts have
gone out to the mother whom she never knew, the mother who even now is
waiting in sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has left behind.Since she left her so long ago, Ruby has hardly given a thought to her
mother.The snow is lying thick on her grave in the little Scottish
kirkyard at home; but Ruby has been happy enough without her, living
her own glad young life without fear of death, and with no thought to
spare for the heaven beyond.But now the radiant vision of last night’s dream, combined with her
father’s words, have set the child thinking.Will the Lord Jesus indeed
answer her mother’s prayer, and one day gather little Ruby among His
jewels?Will he care very much that this little jewel of His has never
tried very hard throughout her short life to work His will or do His
bidding?What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds Ruby all unworthy
to be numbered amongst those jewels of His?And the long-lost mother,
who even in heaven will be the gladder that her little daughter is with
her there, how will she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so long
ago is all in vain?“And if he doesn’t gather me,” Ruby murmurs, staring straight up into
the clear, blue sky, “what shall I do?Oh, what shall I do?”

CHAPTER V.

THE BUSH FIRE.“Will you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ’s sake
    to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?”

    “I will so shew myself, by God’s help.”

                     _Consecration of Bishops, Book of Common Prayer._


Jack’s card is placed upright on the mantel-piece of Ruby’s bedroom,
its back leaning against the wall, and before it stands a little girl
with a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle between her brows.“It says it there,” Ruby murmurs, the perplexed wrinkle deepening.“And
that text’s out of the Bible.But when there’s nobody to be kind to, I
can’t do anything.”

The sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene; but Ruby is not looking
at the snow scene.Her eyes are following the old, old words of the
first Christmas carol: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men!”

“If there was only anybody to be kind to,” the little girl repeats
slowly.“Dad and mamma don’t need me to be kind to them, and I _am_
quite kind to Hans and Dick.If it was only in Scotland now; but it’s
quite different here.”

The soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds gently to and fro,
and ruffling with its soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about the
station.To the child’s mind has come a remembrance, a remembrance of
what was “only a dream,” and she sees an old, old man, bowed down with
the weight of years, coming to her across the moonlit paths of last
night, an old man whom Ruby had let lie where he fell, because he was
only “the wicked old one.”

“It was only a dream, so it didn’t matter.” Thus the little girl tries
to soothe a suddenly awakened conscience.“And he _is_ a wicked old
one; Dick said he was.”

Ruby goes over to the window, and stands looking out.There is no
change in the fair Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby’s eyes
have rested since first she came.But there is a strange, unexplained
change in the little girl’s heart.Only that the dear Lord Jesus has
come to Ruby, asking her for His dear sake to be kind to one of the
lowest and humblest of His creatures.“If it was only anybody else,”
she mutters.“But he’s so horrid, and he has such a horrid face.And I
don’t see what I could do to be kind to such a nasty old man as he is.Besides, perhaps dad wouldn’t like me.”

“Good will toward men!Good will toward men!” Again the heavenly
voices seem ringing in Ruby’s ears.There is no angel host about her
to strengthen and encourage her, only one very lonely little girl who
finds it hard to do right when the doing of that right does not quite
fit in with her own inclinations.She has taken the first step upon the
heavenly way, and finds already the shadow of the cross.The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in Ruby’s brown eyes, the
radiance, it may be, of something far greater in her heart.“I’ll do it!” the little girl decides suddenly.“I’ll try to be kind to
the ‘old one.’ Only what can I do?”

“Miss Ruby!” cries an excited voice at the window, and, looking out,
Ruby sees Dick’s brown face and merry eyes.“Come ’long as quick as
you can.There’s a fire, and you said t’other day you’d never seen one.I’ll get Smuttie if you come as quick as you can.It’s over by old
Davis’s place.”

Dick’s young mistress does not need a second bidding.She is out
waiting by the garden-gate long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.Away to the west she can see the long glare of fire shooting up tongues
of flame into the still sunlight, and brightening the river into a very
sea of blood.“I don’t think you should go, Ruby,” says her mother, who has come
out on the verandah.“It isn’t safe, and you are so venturesome.I am
dreadfully anxious about your father too.Dick says he and the men are
off to help putting out the fire; but in such weather as this I don’t
see how they can ever possibly get it extinguished.”

“I’ll be very, very careful, mamma,” Ruby promises.Her brown eyes
are ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.“And I’ll be there
to watch dad too, you know,” she adds persuasively in a voice which
expresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he
and his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be
got to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The
first spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the
excessive heat of the sun’s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,
and where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been
laid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the
case, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.“Look at it!” Dick cries excitedly.“Goin’ like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn’t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He’ll maybe be frightened at
the fire.they’ve got the start of it.Do you see that other fire
on ahead?That’s where they’re burning down!”

Ruby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as
Dick has said, “like steam-engines.”

“My!” the boy cries suddenly; “it’s the old wicked one’s house.It’s it
that has got afire.There’s not enough
of them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it’ll be on to your
pa’s land if they don’t stop it pretty soon.I’ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby.You’ll have to get off Smuttie and hold
him in case he gets scared at the fire.”

“Oh, Dick!” the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes
are fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.“Do you think
he’ll be dead?Do you think the old man’ll be dead?”

“Not him,” Dick returns, with a grin.“He’s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!” the boy ejaculates.“It would be a good
riddance of bad rubbish, that’s what it would.”

“Oh, Dick,” shivers Ruby, “I wish you wouldn’t say that.I’ve never been kind!” Ruby
breaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is
hard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the
Australian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are
two detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish
the flames of poor old Davis’s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down
the thickets in advance, and thus starving the main fire as it gains
ground.This method of “starving the fire” is well known to dwellers in
the Australian bush, though at times the second fire thus given birth
to assumes such proportions as to outrun its predecessor.“It’s not much use.It’s too dry,” Dick mutters.“I don’t like leaving
you, Miss Ruby; but I’ll have to do it.Even a boy’s a bit of help in
bringing the water.You don’t mind, do you, Miss Ruby?I think, if I
was you, now that you’ve seen it, I’d turn and go home again.Smuttie’s
easy enough managed; but if he got frightened, I don’t know what you’d
do.”

“I’ll get down and hold him,” Ruby says.“I want to watch.” Her heart
is sick within her.She has never seen a fire before, and it seems so
fraught with danger that she trembles when she thinks of dad, the being
she loves best on earth.“Go you away to the fire, Dick,” adds Ruby,
very pale, but very determined.“I’m not afraid of being left alone.”

The fire is gaining ground every moment, and poor old Davis’s desolate
home bids fair to be soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.Dick gives one look at the burning house, and another at his little
mistress.There is no time to waste if he is to be of any use.“I don’t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,” says Dick again; but he goes all
the same.Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie’s head, consoling that faithful
little animal now and then with a pat of the hand.It is hot,
scorchingly hot; but such cold dread sits at the little girl’s heart
that she does not even feel the heat.In her ears is the hissing of
those fierce flames, and her love for dad has grown to be a very agony
in the thought that something may befall him.“Ruby!” says a well-known voice, and through the blaze of sunlight she
sees her father coming towards her.His face, like Ruby’s, is very
pale, and his hands are blackened with the grime and soot.“You ought
not to be here, child.Away home to your mother,
and tell her it is all right, for I know she will be feeling anxious.”

“But is it all right, dad?” the little girl questions anxiously.Her
eyes flit from dad’s face to the burning cottage, and then to those
other figures in the lurid light far away.“And mamma _will_ be
frightened; for she’ll think you’ll be getting hurt.And so will I,”
adds poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.“What nonsense, little girl,” says her father cheerfully.“There,
dear, I have no time to wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you
away.That’s a brave little girl,” he adds, stooping to kiss the small
anxious face.It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides home lonely by the
river’s side.She has not waited for her trouble to come to her, but
has met it half way, as more people than little brown-eyed Ruby are too
fond of doing.Dad is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole wide
world, and if anything happens to dad, whatever will she do?“I just couldn’t bear it,” murmurs poor Ruby, wiping away a very big
tear which has fallen on Smuttie’s broad back.Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown eyes, you have still to
learn that any trouble can be borne patiently, and with a brave face to
the world, if only God gives His help![Illustration]




[Illustration]




CHAPTER VI.“I CAN NEVER DO IT NOW!”

          “Then, darling, wait;
          Nothing is late,
  In the light that shines for ever!”


That is a long, long day to Ruby.From Glengarry they can watch far
away the flames, like so many forked and lurid tongues of fire, leaping
up into the still air and looking strangely out of place against
the hazy blue of the summer sky.The little girl leaves her almost
untouched dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where she sits, a
forlorn-looking little figure, in the glare of the afternoon sunshine,
with her knees drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes following
eagerly the pathway by the river where she has ridden with Dick no
later than this morning.This morning!--to waiting Ruby it seems more
like a century ago.Jenny finds her there when she has washed up the dinner dishes, tidied
all for the afternoon, and come out to get what she expresses as a
“breath o’ caller air,” after her exertions of the day.The “breath
o’ air” Jenny may get; but it will never be “caller” nor anything
approaching “caller” at this season of the year.Poor Jenny, she may
well sigh for the fresh moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its
shady glens, where the bracken and wild hyacinth grow, and where the
very plash of the mountain torrent or “sough” of the wind among the
trees, makes one feel cool, however hot and sultry it may be.“Ye’re no cryin’, Miss Ruby?” ejaculates Jenny.“No but that the heat
o’ this outlandish place would gar anybody cry.What’s wrong wi’ ye, ma
lambie?” Jenny can be very gentle upon occasion.“Are ye no weel?” For
all her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny’s Scotch tongue is
still aggressively Scotch.Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles struggle hard for mastery.“I’m not crying, _really_, Jenny,” she answers.“Only,” with a
suspicious droop of the dark-fringed eye-lids and at the corners of the
rosy mouth, “I was pretty near it.I can’t help watching the flames, and thinking that something might
perhaps be happening to him, and me not there to know.And then I began
to feel glad to think how nice it would be to see him and Dick come
riding home.Jenny, how _do_ little girls get along who have no
father?”

It is strange that Ruby never reflects that her own mother has gone
from her.“The Lord A’mighty tak’s care o’ such,” Jenny responds solemnly.“Ye’ll just weary your eyes glowerin’ awa’ at the fire like that, Miss
Ruby.They say that ‘a watched pot never boils,’ an’ I’m thinkin’ your
papa’ll no come a meenit suner for a’ your watchin’.Gae in an’ rest
yersel’ like the mistress.She’s sleepin’ finely on the sofa.”

Ruby gives a little impatient wriggle.“How can I, Jenny,” she exclaims
piteously, “when dad’s out there?I don’t know whatever I would do
if anything was to happen to dad.”

“Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,” the Scotchwoman says
reverently.“Ye’ll be in richt gude keepin’ then, an’ them ye love as
weel.”

But Ruby only wriggles again.She does not want Jenny’s solemn talk.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little
daughter’s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so
tedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and
cups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child’s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been
gazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby
hardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members
suffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother’s
fretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away
her heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.“Oh, me!” sighs the poor little girl.“Will he never come?”

Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged
with the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to
meet him.“Oh, dad darling!” she cries.“I did think you were never coming.Oh,
dad, are you hurt?” her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a
sling.“Only a scratch, little girl,” he says.“Don’t
frighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened?Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?”

“I didn’t know,” Ruby says.“And mamma was
frightened too.And when even Dick didn’t come back.Oh, dad, wasn’t it
just dreadful--the fire, I mean?”

Black Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the
house, hanging on her father’s uninjured arm.The child’s heart has
grown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her
down for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous
self again.“Dad,” the little girl says later on.They are sitting out on the
verandah, enjoying the comparative cool of the evening.“What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house is burnt down?It won’t
hardly be worth while his building another, now that he’s so old.”

Dad does not answer just for a moment, and Ruby, glancing quickly
upwards, almost fancies that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave.Perhaps he does not even wish her to mention the
name of the old man, who, but that he is “so old,” should now have been
in prison.“Old Davis will never need another house now, Ruby,” Dad answers,
looking down into the eager little upturned face.God has taken him away, dear.”

“He’s dead?” Ruby questions with wide-open, horror-stricken eyes.The little girl hardly hears her father as he goes on to tell her how
the old man’s end came, suddenly and without warning, crushing him in
the ruins of his burning cottage, where the desolate creature died
as he had lived, uncared for and alone.Into Ruby’s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act left for ever undone,
a kind word for ever unspoken.“And I can never do it now!” the child sobs.“He’ll never even know I
wanted to be kind to him!”

“Kind to whom, little girl?” her father asks wonderingly.And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs out her story.“I can never
do it now!” that is the burden of her sorrow.The late Australian twilight gathers round them, and the stars twinkle
out one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars
and the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one
little girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be “kind,”
and it may be that in His own good time--and God’s time is always the
best--He will let old Davis “know” also.[Illustration]




CHAPTER VII.“There came a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season.Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,
  ‘A day for gods to stoop,’ she answered ‘Ay,
  And men to soar.’”

                                          TENNYSON.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase
away.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED

  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.Twelve light frames for firing the 12-pounder Rockets at
high angles are further provided in addition to the ground chambers,
and each of the drivers of the ammunition horses has one in his charge,
in case of distant action.The preparation of the Rocket for firing is merely the fixing the stick
to it, either by the pincers, pointed hammer, or wrench, provided for
joining the parts of the stick also.These modes I have lately devised,
as being more simple and economical than the screw formerly used; but
cannot at present pronounce which is the best; great care, however,
must be taken to fix the stick securely, as every thing depends on it;
the vent also must be very carefully uncovered, as, if not perfectly
so, the Rocket is liable to burst; and in firing the portfire must not
be thrust too far into the Rocket, for the same reason.On the words “_Cease firing_,” No.1 cuts his portfire, takes up
his chamber, runs back to his section, and replaces the chamber
immediately.3 also immediately runs back; and having no other
operation to perform, replaces the leading reins, and the whole are
ready to mount again, for the performance of any further manœuvre that
may be ordered, in less than a minute from the word “_Cease firing_”
having been given.It is obvious that the combined celerity and quantity of the discharge
of ammunition of this description of artillery cannot be equalled or
even approached, taking in view the means and nature of ammunition
employed, by any other known system; the universality also of the
operation, not being incumbered with wheel carriages, must be duly
appreciated, as, in fact, it can proceed not only wherever cavalry can
act, but even wherever infantry can get into action; it having been
already mentioned that part of the exercise of these troops, supposing
them to be stopped by walls, or ditches and morasses, impassable to
horses, is to take the holsters and sticks from the horses, and advance
on foot.Another vast advantage is the few men required to make a complete
section, as by this means the number of points of fire is so greatly
multiplied, compared to any other system of artillery.Thus it may
be stated that the number of bouches a feù, which may comparatively
be brought into action, by equal means, on the scale of a troop of
horse artillery, would be at least six to one; and that they may
either be spread over a great extent of line, or concentrated into a
very small focus, according to the necessity of the service; indeed
the skirmishing exercise of the Rocket Cavalry, divided and spread
into separate sections, and returning by sound of bugle, forms a very
interesting part of the system, and can be well imagined from the
foregoing description and the annexed Plate.[Illustration: _Plate 3_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




ROCKET CARS.1, represents a Rocket Car in line of march.There are
two descriptions of these cars, of similar construction--one for 32
or 24-pounder ammunition, the other for 18 or 12-pounder; and which
are, therefore, called heavy or light cars: the heavy car will carry
40 rounds of 24-pounder Rockets, armed with cohorn shells, and the
light one will convey 60 rounds of 12-pounder, or 50 of 18-pounder
ammunition, which is packed in boxes on the limber, the sticks being
carried in half lengths in the boxes on the after part of the carriage,
where the men also ride on seats fixed for the purpose, and answering
also for small store boxes; they are each supposed to be drawn by four
horses.These cars not only convey the ammunition, but are contrived also
to discharge each two Rockets in a volley from a double iron plate
trough, which is of the same length as the boxes for the sticks, and
travels between them; but which, being moveable, may, when the car is
unlimbered, be shifted into its fighting position at any angle from the
ground ranges, or point blank up to 45°, without being detached front
the carriage.2 represents these Rocket Cars in action: the one on the left
hand has its trough in the position for ground firing, the trough
being merely lifted off the bed of the axle tree on which it travels,
and laid on the ground, turning by two iron stays on a centre in the
axle tree; the right hand car is elevated to a high angle, the trough
being raised and supported by the iron stays behind, and in front by
the perch of the carriage, connected to it by a joint, the whole kept
steady by bolting the stays, and by tightening a chain from the perch
to the axle tree.The limbers are always supposed to be in the rear.The Rockets are fired with a portfire and long stick; and two men will
fight the light car, four men the heavy one.The exercise is very simple; the men being told off, Nos.1, 2, 3,
and 4, to the heavy carriage.On the words, “_Prepare for action, and
unlimber_,” the same process takes place as in the 6-pounder exercise.On the words, “_Prepare for ground firing_,” Nos.2 and 3 take hold
of the hand irons, provided on purpose, and, with the aid of No.4,
raise the trough from its travelling position, and lower it down to
the ground under the carriage; or on the words “_Prepare to elevate_,”
raise it to the higher angles, No.4 bolting the stays, and fixing the
chain.1 having in the mean time prepared and lighted his portfire,
and given the direction of firing to the trough, Nos.2, 3, and 4,
then run to the limber to fix the ammunition, which No.2 brings up,
two rounds at a time, or one, as ordered, and helping No.1 to place
them in the trough as far back as the stick will admit: this operation
is facilitated by No.1 stepping upon the lower end of either of the
stick boxes, on which a cleat is fastened for this purpose; No.1 then
discharges the two Rockets separately, firing that to leeward first,
while No.2 returns for more ammunition: this being the hardest duly,
the men will, of course, relieve No.In fighting the
light frame, two men are sufficient to elevate or depress it, but they
will want aid to fix and bring up the ammunition for quick firing.[Illustration: _Plate 4_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




ROCKET INFANTRY IN LINE OF MARCH, AND IN ACTION.1, represents a sub-division of Rocket infantry in line
of march--Fig.The system here shewn is the use
of the Rockets by infantry--one man in ten, or any greater proportion,
carrying a frame, of very simple construction, from which the Rockets
may be discharged either for ground ranges, or at high angles, and
the rest carrying each three rounds of ammunition, which, for this
service, is proposed to be either the 12-pounder Shell Rockets, or the
12-pounder Rocket case shot, each round equal to the 6-pounder case,
and ranging 2,500 yards.So that 100 men will bring into action, in
any situation where musketry can be used, nearly 300 rounds of this
description of artillery, with ranges at 45°, double those of light
field ordnance.The exercise and words of command are as follow:

No.1 carries the frame, which is of very simple construction, standing
on legs like a theodolite, when spread, and which closes similarly
for carrying.This frame requires no spunging, the Rocket being fired
merely from an open cradle, from which it may be either discharged by
a lock or by a portfire, in which case.1 also carries the pistol,
portfire-lighter, and tube box.2 carries a small pouch, with the
requisite small stores, such as spare tubes, portfires, &c.; and a long
portfire stick.3, 4, and 5, &c. to 10, carry each, conveniently, on his back, a
pouch, containing three Rockets; and three sticks, secured together by
straps and buckles.With this distribution, they advance in double files.On the word
“_Halt_,” “_Prepare for action_,” being given, No.1 spreads his frame,
and with the assistance of No.2, fixes it firmly into the ground,
preparing it at the desired elevation.2 then hands the portfire
stick to No.1, who prepares and lights it, while No.2 steps back to
receive the Rocket; which has been prepared by Nos.3, 4, &c. who have
fallen back about fifteen paces, on the word being given to “_Prepare
for action_.” These men can always supply the ammunition quicker than
it can be fired, and one or other must therefore advance towards the
frame to meet No.2 having thus received
the Rocket, places it on the cradle, at the same instant that No.1
puts a tube into the vent.2 then points the frame, which has an
universal traverse after the legs are fixed; he then gives the word
“_Ready_,” “_Fire_,” to No.1, who takes up his portfire and discharges
the Rocket.1 now sticks his portfire stick into the ground, and
prepares another tube; while No.2, as before, puts the Rocket into the
frame, points, and gives the word “_Ready_,” “_Fire_,” again.By this
process, from three to four Rockets a minute may, without difficulty,
be fired from one frame, until the words “_Cease firing_,” “_Prepare
to advance_,” or “_retreat_,” are given; when the frame is in a moment
taken from the ground, and the whole party may either retire or advance
immediately in press time, if required.To insure which, and at the
same time to prevent any injury to the ammunition, Nos.3, 4, &c. must
not be allowed to take off their pouches, as they will be able to
assist one another in preparing the ammunition, by only laying down
their sticks; in taking up which again no time is lost.If the frame is fired with a lock, the same process is used, except
that No.1 primes and cocks, and No.2 fires on receiving the word from
No.For ground firing, the upper part of this frame, consisting of the
chamber and elevating stem, takes off from the legs, and the bottom of
the stem being pointed like a picquet post, forms a very firm bouche a
feù when stuck into the ground; the chamber at point blank being at a
very good height for this practice, and capable of traversing in any
direction.The exercise, in this case, is, of course, in other respects
similar to that at high angles.[Illustration: _Plate 5_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT.1, represents the mode of carrying the bombarding frame
and ammunition by men.The apparatus required is merely a light
ladder, 12 feet in length, having two iron chambers, which are fixed
on in preparing for action at the upper end of the ladder; from which
chambers the Rockets are discharged, by means of a musket lock; the
ladder being reared to any elevation, by two legs or pry-poles, as in
Fig. 2.Every thing required for this service may be carried by men;
or a Flanders-pattern ammunition waggon, with four horses, will convey
60 rounds of 32-pounder Carcasses, in ten boxes, eight of the boxes
lying cross-ways on the floor of the waggon, and two length-ways, at
top.On these the frame, complete for firing two Rockets at a flight,
with spunges, &c. is laid; and the sticks on each side, to complete
the stowage of all that is necessary, the whole being covered by the
tilt.Four men only are required to be attached to each waggon, who are
numbered 1, 2, 3, & 4.The frame and ammunition having been brought into the battery, or to
any other place, concealed either by trees or houses (for from the
facility of taking new ground, batteries are not so indispensable as
with mortars), the words “_Prepare for bombardment_” are given; on
which the frame is prepared for rearing, Nos.1 and 2 first fixing the
chambers on the ladder; Nos.3 and 4 attaching the legs to the frame
as it lies on the ground.The words “_Rear frame_” are then given;
when all assist in raising it, and the proper elevation is given,
according to the words “_Elevate to 35°_” or “_45°_,” or whatever
angle the officer may judge necessary, according to the required
range, by spreading or closing the legs of the frame, agreeable to
the distances marked in degrees on a small measuring tape, which the
non-commissioned officer carries, and which is called--the Elevating
Line.The word “_Point_” is then given: which is done by means of a
plumb-line, hanging down from the vertex of the triangle, and which at
the same time shews whether the frame is upright or not.1 and 2 place themselves at the foot of the ladder,
and Nos.3 and 4 return to fix the ammunition in the rear, in readiness
for the word “_Load_.” When this is given, No.3 brings a Rocket to the
foot of the ladder, having before hand _carefully_ taken off the circle
that covered the vent, and handing it to No.1 has ascended the ladder to receive the first
Rocket from No.2, and to place it in the chamber at the top of the
ladder; by the time this is done, No.2 is ready to give him another
Rocket, which in like manner he places in the other chamber: he then
primes the locks with a tube and powder, and, cocking the two locks,
after every thing else is done, descends from the ladder, and, when
down, gives the word “_Ready_;” on which, he and No.2 each take one of
the trigger lines, and retire ten or twelve paces obliquely, waiting
for the word “_Fire_” from the officer or non-commissioned officer, on
which they pull, either separately or together, as previously ordered.1 immediately runs up and
spunges out the two chambers with a very wet spunge, having for this
purpose a water bucket suspended at the top of the frame; which being
done, he receives a Rocket from No.3 having, in
the mean time, brought up a fresh supply; in doing which, however, he
must never bring from the rear more than are wanted for each round.In this routine, any number of rounds is tired, until the words
“_Cease firing_” are given; which, if followed by those, “_Prepare to
retreat_,” Nos.3 and 4 run forward to the ladder; and on the words
_“Lower frame_,” they ease it down in the same order in which it was
raised, take it to pieces, and may thus retire in less than five
minutes: or if the object of ceasing to fire is merely a change of
position to no great distance, the four men may with ease carry the
frame, without taking it to pieces, the waggon following them with the
ammunition, or the ammunition being borne by men, as circumstances may
render expedient._The ammunition_ projected from this frame consists of 32-pounder
Rockets, armed with carcasses of the following sorts and ranges:--


1st.--_The small carcass_, containing 8 lbs.of carcass composition,
being 3 lbs.more than the present 10-inch spherical carcass.--Range
3,000 yards.2nd.--_The medium carcass_, containing 12 lbs.of carcass composition,
being equal to the present 13-inch.--Range 2,500 yards.3rd.--_The large carcass_, containing 18 lbs.of carcass composition,
being 6 lbs.more than the present 13-inch spherical carcass.--Range
2,000 yards.Or 32-pounder Rockets, armed with bursting cones, made of stout iron,
filled with powder, to be exploded by fuzes, and to be used to produce
the explosive effects of shells, where such effect is preferred to the
conflagration of the carcass.These cones contain as follows:--

_Small._--Five lbs.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a
10-inch shell.--Range 3,000 yards.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a
13-inch shell.--Range 2,500 yards.I have lately had a successful experiment, with bombarding
Rockets, six inches diameter, and weighing 148 lbs.--and doubt not of
extending the bombarding powers of the system much further.[Illustration: _Plate 6_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT, FROM EARTH WORKS, WITHOUT
APPARATUS.1, is a perspective view of a Battery, erected expressly
for throwing Rockets in bombardment, where the interior <DW72> has the
angle of projection required, and is equal to the length of the Rocket
and stick.The great advantage of this system is, that, as it dispenses with
apparatus: where there is time for forming a work of this sort, of
considerable length, the quantity of fire, that may be thrown in a
given time, is limited only by the length of the work: thus, as the
Rockets may be laid in embrasures cut in the bank, at every two feet, a
battery of this description, 200 feet in length, will fire 100 Rockets
in a volley, and so on; or an incessant and heavy fire may, by such
a battery, be kept up from one flank to the other, by replacing the
Rockets as fast as they are fired in succession.The rule for forming this battery is as follows.“The length of the interior <DW72> of this work is half formed by the
excavation, and half by the earth thrown out; for the base therefore of
the interior <DW72> of the part to be raised, at an angle of 55°, set
off two thirds of the intended perpendicular height--cut down the <DW72>
to a perpendicular depth equal to the above mentioned height--then
setting off, for the breadth of the interior excavation, one third more
than the intended thickness of the work, carry down a regular ramp
from the back part of this excavation to the foot of the <DW72>, and
the excavation will supply the quantity of earth necessary to give the
exterior face a <DW72> of 45°.”

Fig.2 is a perspective view of a common epaulement converted into a
Rocket battery.In this case, as the epaulement is not of sufficient
length to support the Rocket and stick, holes must be bored in the
ground, with a miner’s borer, of a sufficient depth to receive the
sticks, and at such distances, and such an angle, as it is intended
to place the Rockets for firing.The inside of the epaulement must be
pared away to correspond with this angle, say 55°.The Rockets are then
to be laid in embrasures, formed in the bank, as in the last case.Where the ground is such as to admit of using the borer, this latter
system, of course, is the easiest operation; and for such ground as
would be likely to crumble into the holes, slight tubes are provided,
about two feet long, to preserve the opening; in fact, these tubes will
be found advantageous in all ground.2 also shews a powerful mode of defending a field work by means of
Rockets, in addition to the defences of the present system; merely by
cutting embrasures in the glacis, for horizontal firing.[Illustration: _Plate 7_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




A ROCKET AMBUSCADE.1, represents one of the most important uses that can be
made of Rockets for field service; it is that of the Rocket Ambuscade
for the defence of a pass, or for covering the retreat of an army,
by placing any number, hundreds or thousands, of 32 or 24-pounder
shell Rockets, or of 32-pounder Rockets, armed with 18-pounder shot,
limited as to quantity only by the importance of the object, which
is to be obtained; as by this means, the most extensive destruction,
even amounting to annihilation, may be carried amongst the ranks of an
advancing enemy, and that with the exposure of scarcely an individual.The Rockets are laid in rows or batteries of 100 or 500 in a row,
according to the extent of ground to be protected.They are to be
concealed either in high grass, or masked in any other convenient
way; and the ambuscade may be formed of any required number of these
batteries, one behind the other, each battery being prepared to be
discharged in a volley, by leaders of quick match: so that one man is,
in fact, alone sufficient to fire the whole in succession, beginning
with that nearest to the enemy, as soon as he shall have perceived
them near enough to warrant his firing.Where the batteries are very
extensive, each battery may be sub-divided into smaller parts, with
separate trains to each, so that the whole, or any particular division
of each battery, may be fired, according to the number and position of
the enemy advancing.Trains, or leaders, are provided for this service,
of a particular construction, being a sort of flannel saucissons,
with two or three threads of slow match, which will strike laterally
at all points, and are therefore very easy of application; requiring
only to be passed from Rocket to Rocket, crossing the vents, by which
arrangement the fire running along, from vent to vent, is sure to
strike every Rocket in quick succession, without their disturbing each
others’ direction in going off, which they might otherwise do, being
placed within 18 inches apart, if all were positively fired at the same
instant.2 is a somewhat similar application, but not so much in the nature
of an ambuscade as of an open defence.Here a very low work is thrown
up, for the defence of a post, or of a chain of posts, consisting
merely of as much earth and turf as is sufficient to form the sides of
shallow embrasures for the large Rockets, placed from two to three feet
apart, or nearer; from which the Rockets are supposed to be discharged
independently, by a certain number of artillery-men, employed to keep
up the fire, according to the necessity of the case.It is evident, that by this mode, an incessant and tremendous fire may
be maintained, which it would be next to impossible for an advancing
enemy to pass through, not only from its quantity and the weight and
destructive nature of the ammunition, but from the closeness of its
lines and its contiguity to the ground; leaving, in fact, no space in
front which must not be passed over and ploughed up after very few
rounds.As both these operations are supposed to be employed in defensive
warfare, and therefore in fixed stations, there is no difficulty
involved in the establishment of a sufficient depôt of ammunition for
carrying them on upon the most extensive scale; though it is obviously
impossible to accomplish any thing approaching this system of defence,
by the ordinary means of artillery.[Illustration: _Plate 8_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF FORTIFIED PLACES.1, represents the advanced batteries and approaches in
the attack of some fortress, where an imperfect breach being supposed
to have been made in the salient angle of any bastion, large Rockets,
weighing each from two to three hundred weight or more, and being each
loaded with not less than a barrel of powder, are fired into the ruins
after the revetment is broken, in order, by continual explosions, to
render the breach practicable in the most expeditious way.To insure
every Rocket that is fired having the desired effect, they are so
heavily laden, as not to rise off the ground when fired along it; and
under these circumstances are placed in a small shallow trench, run
along to the foot of the glacis, from the nearest point of the third
parallel, and in a direct line for the breach: by this means, the
Rockets being laid in this trench will invariably pursue exactly the
same course, and every one of them will be infallibly lodged in the
breach.It is evident, that the whole of this is intended as a night
operation, and a few hours would suffice, not only for running forward
the trench, which need not be more than 18 inches deep, and about nine
inches wide, undiscovered, but also for firing a sufficient number of
Rockets to make a most complete breach before the enemy could take
means to prevent the combinations of the operation.From the experiments I have lately made, I have reason to believe, that
Rockets much larger than those above mentioned may be formed for this
description of service--Rockets from half a ton to a ton weight; which
being driven in very strong and massive cast iron cases, may possess
such strength and force, that, being fired by a process similar to
that above described, even against the revetment of any fortress,
unimpaired by a cannonade, it shall, by its mass and form, pierce the
same; and having pierced it, shall, with one explosion of several
barrels of powder, blow such portion of the masonry into the ditch, as
shall, with very few rounds, complete a practicable breach.It is evident, from this view of the weapon, that the Rocket System is
not only capable of a degree of portability, and facility for light
movements, which no weapon possesses, but that its ponderous parts, or
the individual masses of its ammunition, also greatly exceed those of
ordinary artillery.And yet, although this last description of Rocket
ammunition appears of an enormous mass, as ammunition, still if it be
found capable of the powers here supposed, of which _I_ have little
doubt, the whole weight to be brought in this way against any town, for
the accomplishment of a breach, will bear _no comparison_ whatever to
the weight of ammunition now required for the same service, independent
of the saving of time and expense, and the great comparative simplicity
of the approaches and works required for a siege carried on upon this
system.This class of Rockets I propose to denominate the _Belier a
feù_.2 represents the converse of this system, or the use of these
larger Rockets for the defence of a fortress by the demolition of the
batteries erected against it.In this case, the Rockets are fired from
embrasures, in the crest of the glacis, along trenches cut a part of
the way in the direction of the works to be demolished.[Illustration: _Plate 9_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




OF THE USE OF ROCKETS BY INFANTRY AGAINST CAVALRY, AND IN COVERING THE
STORMING OF A FORTRESS.1, represents an attack of cavalry against infantry,
repulsed by the use of Rockets.These Rockets are supposed to be of the
lightest nature, 12 or 9-pounders, carried on bat horses or in small
tumbrils, or with 6-pounder shell Rockets, of which one man is capable
of carrying six in a bundle, for any peculiar service; or so arranged,
that the flank companies of every regiment may be armed, each man, with
such a Rocket, in addition to his carbine or rifle, the Rocket being
contained in a small leather case, attached to his cartouch, slinging
the carbine or rifle, and carrying the stick on his shoulder, serving
him either as a spear, by being made to receive the bayonet, or as a
rest for his piece.By this means every battalion would possess a powerful battery of
this ammunition, _in addition_ to all its ordinary means of attack
and defence, and with scarcely any additional burthen to the flank
companies, the whole weight of the Rocket and stick not exceeding six
pounds, and the difference between the weight of a rifle and that of a
musket being about equivalent.As to the mode of using them in action,
for firing at long ranges, as these Rockets are capable of a range of
2,000 yards, a few portable frames might be carried by each regiment,
without any incumbrance, the frames for this description of Rocket not
being heavier than a musket; but as the true intention of the arm, in
this distribution of it, is principally for close quarters, either
in case of a charge of cavalry, or even of infantry, it is generally
supposed to be fired in vollies, merely laid on the ground, as in
the Plate here described.And, as it is well known, how successfully
charges of cavalry are frequently sustained by infantry, even by the
fire of the musket alone, it is not presuming too much to infer, that
the repulse of cavalry would be _absolutely certain_, by masses of
infantry, possessing the additional aid of powerful vollies of these
shell Rockets.So also in charges of infantry, whether the battalion so
armed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley
of one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank
companies, must produce the most decisive effects.Neither can it be
doubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might
make the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their
rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur manœuvres.In
like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,
or for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such
occasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as
shewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark
that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited
than the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by
means of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both
carcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from
the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of
the third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or
three vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the
storming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest
stress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not
therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket
carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as
the 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the
10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a
Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell
thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_
throwing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the
_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question
that an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,
is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of
ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow
succession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,
and a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the
general basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due
proportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be
attained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to
exceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily
        produce more destruction than when they happen in
        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as
        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of
fortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is
the only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried
into a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets
may accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is
infinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would
enable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only
to scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or
passage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;
but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,
while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as
to the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets.The
frame is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of
the legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for
which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,
therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,
each of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it
with the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by
the haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the
frame being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into
the stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by
a trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men
are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail
set, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually
prevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to
the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;
it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself
discharged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a
six-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is
evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as
well as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or
tanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and
an attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as
from its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is
no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the
marine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the
burthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,
so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the
point of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:
insomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest
mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the
smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell
Rockets recochét in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is
another use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be
passed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a
ship by boarding.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short
stick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the
Rocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with
10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes
are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by
hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,
so as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual
destruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst
the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by
the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect
has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when
they enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER
SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;
by which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these
ships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending
entirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided
in the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and
shell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly
close together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and
top-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives
for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these
racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents
uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which
can be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged
merely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a
considerable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen
to the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will
have returned into safety before any discharge takes place.It is
evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be
calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the
fire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in
the most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to
have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it
is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with
clouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power
of destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass
harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats
in towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely
precluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any
boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth
shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had
an opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French
Fleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was
ascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it
in the enemy.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire
Rockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every
vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the
gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the
smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;
the sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either
by iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the
Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,
as shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and
frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of
war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all
positions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any
possibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these
ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for
bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,
are capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even
24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description
of small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for
general service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be
fitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described
in Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or
the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a
small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside
of the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small
vessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not
carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:
it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore
OWEN’s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and
some with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig.4]




ROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition
which have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion
Rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell
Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and
light natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number
of inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the
24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to
the 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are
from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,
or bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks
are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in
the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in
each case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole
of this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same
facility as the medium and light parts.These Rockets are fired from
bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;
or they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may
also be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the
purposes of explosion.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less
diameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are
therefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the
demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been
realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not
its only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses
than can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project
which, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,
mortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers
of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to
specify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally
used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of
bombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders
them in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them
as medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds
of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and
may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,
either for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations
of three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks
in the centre also strongly bound together.The great art of firing
these _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by
priming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of
powder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42
and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the
32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch
howitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the
least Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed
either with shot or shell, for field service.The 24-pounder Rocket is
very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the
saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly
equal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,
is armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a
6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder
with a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast
expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing
the resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description
of case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity
of musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the
Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained
in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be
given in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates
the balls.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained
in a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in
the shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,
are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be
instantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,
by a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the
bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the
Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden
fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can
be necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is
regulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving
any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden
fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By
this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a
facility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar
operations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient
length for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they
are made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose
issuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell
and case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the
mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,
according to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements
used for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of
different sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they
belong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to
accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into
the stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix
it immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not
hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the
different natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of
speculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter
found a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or
projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of
combining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively
a shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the
Rocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is
required at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be
carried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as
in Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by
a slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the
air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the
parachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended
in the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will
continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere
for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will
float in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived
and unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the
disengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is
not only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every
Rocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal
case, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage
from humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board
of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less
than eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to
render them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere
expense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,
case, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable
as ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1–15]

CONCLUSION.Calculations proving the comparative Economy of the Rocket Ammunition,
both as to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the
expense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true
understanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest
mode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the
field.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,
which has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with
the 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._

                                                 ------------

If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used
instead of manual labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be
reduced four-fifths, which would lower the amount to about 18_s._
each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted, which I am
endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of
the projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the
comparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of
the charge of powder required to convey it the same distance._s._  _d._

                                                         ------------


So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an
actual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains
more composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing
any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and
that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together
with the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of
throwing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the
use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed £5; and indeed,
on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that
a transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with
every thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while
on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the
requisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need
specifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,
when compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch
spherical carcass costs £1.17_s._ 11½_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the
32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, does not cost more than £1.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case
there is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11½_d._ Now the large
Rocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the
difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the
different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least
double, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the
other comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15
to 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in
the first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate
economy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to
the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than £3.10_s._ that is to
say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,
though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration
are half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is
evident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets
may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling
mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch
shell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or
conflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the
first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a
comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the
Rocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                    {Cartridge, 3½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     7¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.Nothing more remained
to be done at Tientsin, where he had effectually checked the
pernicious counsel pressed on Li Hung Chang most strongly by the
German Minister, and in a minor degree by the representatives of
France and England.In order to influence the Central Government it
was necessary for him to proceed to Peking, and the following
unpublished letter graphically describes his views at the particular
moment:--

     "I am on my way to Peking.There are three parties--Li Hung Chang
     (1), the Court (2), the Literary Class (3).The two first are for
     peace, but dare not say it for fear of the third party.I have
     told Li that he, in alliance with the Court, must coerce the
     third party, and have written this to Li and to the Court Party.By so doing I put my head in jeopardy in going to Peking.I do
     not wish Li to act alone.It is not good he should do anything
     except support the Court Party morally.God will overrule for the
     best.If neither the Court Party nor Li can act, if these two
     remain and let things drift, then there will be a disastrous war,
     of which I shall not see the end.Having given up my commission, I have nothing to look for, and
     indeed I long for the quiet of the future.... If the third party
     hear of my recommendation before the Court Party acts, then I may
     be doomed to a quick exit at Peking.Li Hung Chang is a noble
     fellow, and worth giving one's life for; but he must not rebel
     and lose his good name.It is a sort of general election which is
     going on, but where heads are in gage."Writing to me some months later, General Gordon entered into various
matters relating to this period, and as the letter indirectly throws
light on what may be called the Li Hung Chang episode, I quote it
here, although somewhat out of its proper place:--

     "Thanks for your kind note.I send you the two papers which were
     made public in China, and through the Shen-pao some of it was
     sent over.Another paper of fifty-two articles I gave Li Hung
     Chang, but I purposely kept no copy of it, for it went into--

     "1.The contraband of salt and opium at Hongkong.The advantages of telegraphs and canals, not railways, which
     have ruined Egypt and Turkey by adding to the financial
     difficulties.The effeteness of the Chinese representatives abroad, etc.,
     etc., etc."I wrote as a Chinaman for the Chinese.I recommended Chinese
     merchants to do away with middle-men, and to have Government aid
     and encouragement to create houses or firms in London, etc.; to
     make their own cotton goods, etc.In fact, I wrote as a Chinaman.I see now and then symptoms that they are awake to the situation,
     for my object has been always to put myself into the skin of
     those I may be with, and I like these people as much--well, say
     nearly as much--as I like my countrymen."There are a lot of people in China who would egg on revolts of A
     and B. All this is wrong.I painted this
     picture to the Chinese of 1900: 'Who are those people hanging
     about with jinrickshas?''The Hongs of the European merchants,'
     etc., etc."People have asked me what I thought of the advance of China
     during the sixteen years I was absent.They looked superficially
     at the power military of China.You
     come, I must go; but I go on to say that the stride China has
     made in commerce is immense, and commerce and wealth are the
     power of nations, not the troops.Like the Chinese, I have a
     great contempt for military prowess.I admire
     administrators, not generals.A military Red-Button mandarin has
     to bow low to a Blue-Button civil mandarin, and rightly so to my
     mind."I wrote the other day to Li Hung Chang to protest against the
     railway from Ichang to Peking along the Grand Canal.In making it
     they would enter into no end of expenses, the coin would leave
     the country and they would not understand it, and would be
     fleeced by the financial cormorants of Great Britain.They can
     understand canals.Having arrived at Peking, Gordon was received in several councils by
Prince Chun, the father of the young Emperor and the recognised leader
of the War Party.The leading members of the Grand Council were also
present, and Gordon explained his views to them at length.In the
first place, he said, if there were war he would only stay to help
them on condition that they destroyed the suburbs of Peking, allowed
him to place the city in a proper state of defence, and removed the
Emperor and Court to a place of safety.When they expressed their
opinion that the Taku forts were impregnable, Gordon laughed, and said
they could be taken from the rear.The whole gist of his remarks was
that "they could not go to war," and when they still argued in the
opposite sense, and the interpreter refused to translate the harsh
epithets he applied to such august personages, he took the dictionary,
looked out the Chinese equivalent for "idiocy," and with his finger on
the word, placed it under the eyes of each member of the Council.The
end of this scene may be described in Gordon's own words: "I said make
peace, and wrote out the terms.They were, in all, five articles; the
only one they boggled at was the fifth, about the indemnity.They said
this was too hard and unjust.I said that might be, but what was the
use of talking about it?If a man demanded your money or your life,
you have only three courses open.You must either fight, call for
help, or give up your money.Now, as you cannot fight, it is useless
to call for help, since neither England nor France would stir a finger
to assist you.I believe these are the articles now under discussion
at St Petersburg, and the only one on which there is any question is
the fifth."This latter statement I may add, without going into the
question of the Marquis Tseng's negotiations in the Russian capital,
was perfectly correct.Gordon drew up several notes or memorandums for the information of the
Chinese Government.The first of these was mainly military, and the
following extracts will suffice:--

     "China's power lies in her numbers, in the quick moving of her
     troops, in the little baggage they require, and in their few
     wants.It is known that men armed with sword and spear can
     overcome the best regular troops equipped with breech-loading
     rifles, if the country is at all difficult and if the men with
     spears and swords outnumber their foe ten to one.If this is the
     case where men are armed with spears and swords, it will be much
     truer when those men are themselves armed with breech loaders.Her strength is in
     quiet movements, in cutting off trains of baggage, and in night
     attacks _not pushed home_--in a continuous worrying of her
     enemies.No artillery
     should be moved with the troops; it delays and impedes them.Infantry fire is the most fatal fire; guns make a noise far out
     of proportion to their value in war.If guns are taken into the
     field, troops cannot march faster than these guns.The degree of
     speed at which the guns can be carried dictates the speed at
     which the troops can march.As long as Peking is the centre of
     the Government of China, China can never go to war with any
     first-class power; it is too near the sea."The second memorandum was of greater importance and more general
application.In it he compressed the main heads of his advice into the
smallest possible space, and so far as it was at all feasible to treat
a vast and complicated subject within the limits of a simple and
practical scheme, he therein shows with the greatest clearness how the
regeneration of China might be brought about."In spite of the opinion of some foreigners, it will be generally
     acknowledged that the Chinese are contented and happy, that the
     country is rich and prosperous, and that the people are _au fond_
     united in their sentiments, and ardently desire to remain a
     nation.At constant intervals, however, the whole of this human
     hive is stirred by some dispute between the Pekin Government and
     some foreign Power; the Chinese people, proud of their ancient
     prestige, applaud the high tone taken up by the Pekin Government,
     crediting the Government with the power to support their strong
     words.This goes on for a time, when the Government gives in, and
     corresponding vexation is felt by the people.The recurrence of
     these disputes, the inevitable surrender ultimately of the Pekin
     Government, has the tendency of shaking the Chinese people's
     confidence in the Central Government.The Central Government
     appreciates the fact that, little by little, this prestige is
     being destroyed by their own actions among the Chinese people,
     each crisis then becomes more accentuated or difficult to
     surmount, as the Central Government know each concession is
     another nail in their coffin.The Central Government fear that
     the taking up of a spirited position by any pre-eminent Chinese
     would carry the Chinese people with him, and therefore the
     Central Government endeavour to keep up appearances, and to skirt
     the precipice of war as near as they possibly can, while never
     intending to enter into war."The Central Government residing in the extremity of the Middle
     Kingdom, away from the great influences which are now working in
     China, can never alter one iota from what they were years ago:
     they are being steadily left behind by the people they govern.They know this, and endeavour to stem these influences in all
     ways in their power, hoping to keep the people backward and in
     ignorance, and to <DW44> their progress to the same pace they
     themselves go, if it can be called a pace at all."It is therefore a maxim that 'no progress can be made by the
     Pekin Government.'To them any progress, whether slow or quick,
     is synonymous to slow or quick extinction, for they will never
     move."The term 'Pekin Government' is used advisedly, for if the
     Central Government were moved from Pekin into some province where
     the pulsations and aspirations of the Chinese people could have
     their legitimate effect, then the Central Government and the
     Chinese people, having a unison of thought, would work together."From what has been said above, it is maintained that, so long as
     the Central Government of China isolates itself from the Chinese
     people by residing aloof at Pekin, so long will the Chinese
     people have to remain passive under the humiliations which come
     upon them through the non-progressive and destructive disposition
     of their Government.These humiliations will be the chronic state
     of the Chinese people until the Central Government moves from
     Pekin and reunites itself to its subjects.No army, no purchases
     of ironclad vessels will enable China to withstand a first-class
     Power so long as China keeps her queen bee at the entrance of her
     hive.There is, however, the probability that a proud people like
     the Chinese may sicken at this continual eating of humble pie,
     that the Pekin Government at some time, by skirting too closely
     the precipice of war may fall into it, and then that sequence may
     be anarchy and rebellion throughout the Middle Kingdom which may
     last for years and cause endless misery."It may be asked--How can the present state of things be altered?How can China maintain the high position that the wealth,
     industry, and innate goodness of the Chinese people entitle her
     to have among the nations of the world?Some may say by the
     revolt of this Chinaman or of that Chinaman.To me this seems
     most undesirable, for, in the first place, such action would not
     have the blessing of God, and, in the second, it would result in
     the country being plunged into civil war.The fair, upright, and
     open course for the Chinese people to take is to work, through
     the Press and by petitions, on the Central Government, and to
     request them to move from Pekin, and bring themselves thus more
     into unison with the Chinese people, and thus save that people
     the constant humiliations they have to put up with, owing to the
     seat of the Central Government being at Pekin.This
     recommendation would need no secret societies, no rebellion, no
     treason; if taken up and persevered in it must succeed, and not
     one life need be lost."The Central Government at Pekin could not answer the Chinese
     people except in the affirmative when the Chinese people say to
     the Central Government--'By your residing aloof from us in Pekin,
     where you are exposed to danger, you separate our interests from
     yours, and you bring on us humiliation, which we would never have
     to bear if you resided in the interior.Take our application into
     consideration, and grant our wishes.'"I have been kindly treated by the Central Pekin Government and
     by the Chinese people; it is for the welfare of both parties that
     I have written and signed this paper.I may have expressed myself
     too strongly with respect to the non-progressive nature of the
     Pekin Government, who may desire the welfare of the Middle
     Kingdom as ardently as any other Chinese, but as long as the
     Pekin Government allow themselves to be led and directed by those
     drones of the hive, the Censors, so long must the Pekin
     Government bear the blame earned by those drones in plunging
     China into difficulties.In the insect world the bees get rid of
     the drones in winter."There was yet a third memorandum of a confidential nature written to
Li Hung Chang himself, of which Gordon did not keep a copy, but he
referred to it in the letter written to myself which I have already
quoted.: the prevention of war
between Russia and China, and of a rebellion on the part of Li Hung
Chang under European advice and encouragement, Gordon left China
without any delay.When he reached Shanghai on 16th August he found
another official telegram awaiting him: "Leave cancelled, resignation
not accepted."As he had already taken his passage home he did not
reply, but when he reached Aden he telegraphed as follows: "You might
have trusted me.My passage from China was taken days before the
arrival of your telegram which states 'leave cancelled.'Do you insist
on rescinding the same?"The next day he received a reply granting him
nearly six months' leave, and with that message the question of his
alleged insubordination may be treated as finally settled.There can
be no doubt that among his many remarkable achievements not the least
creditable was this mission to China, when by downright candour, and
unswerving resolution in doing the right thing, he not merely
preserved peace, but baffled the intrigues of unscrupulous
diplomatists and selfish governments.With that incident closed Gordon's connection with China, the country
associated with his most brilliant feats of arms, but in concluding
this chapter it seems to me that I should do well to record some later
expressions of opinion on that subject.The following interesting
letter, written on the eve of the war between France and China in
1882, was published by the _New York Herald_:--

     "The Chinese in their affairs with foreign nations are fully
     aware of their peculiar position, and count with reason that a
     war with either France or another Power will bring them perforce
     allies outside of England.The only Power that could go to war
     with them with impunity is Russia, who can attack them by land.I
     used the following argument to them when I was there:--The
     present dynasty of China is a usurping one--the Mantchou.We may
     say that it exists by sufferance at Pekin, and nowhere else in
     the Empire.If you look at the map of China Pekin is at the
     extremity of the Empire and not a week's marching from the
     Russian frontier.A war with Russia would imply the capture of
     Pekin and the fall of the Mantchou dynasty, which would never
     dare to leave it, for if they did the Chinamen in the south would
     smite them.I said, 'If you go to war then move the Queen
     Bee--_i.e._ the Emperor--into the centre of China and then fight;
     if not, you must make peace.'The two Powers who can coerce China
     are Russia and England.Russia could march without much
     difficulty on Pekin.This much would not hurt trade, so England
     would not interfere.England could march to Taku and Pekin and no
     one would object, for she would occupy the Treaty Ports.But if
     France tried to do so England would object.Thus it is that China
     will only listen to Russia and England, and eventually she must
     fear Russia the most of all Powers, for she can never get over
     the danger of the land journey, but she might, by a great
     increase of her fleet, get over the fear of England.I say China,
     but I mean the Mantchou dynasty, for the Mantchous are despised
     by the Chinese.Any war with China would be for France expensive
     and dangerous, not from the Chinese forces, which would be soon
     mastered, but from the certainty of complications with England.As for the European population in China, write them down as
     identical with those in Egypt in all affairs.Their sole idea is,
     without any distinction of nationality, an increased power over
     China for their own trade and for opening up the country as they
     call it, and any war would be popular with them; so they will egg
     on any Power to make it.My idea is that no colonial or foreign
     community in a foreign land can properly, and for the general
     benefit of the world, consider the questions of that foreign
     State.The leading idea is how they will benefit themselves.The
     Isle of Bourbon or Reunion is the cause of the Madagascar war.It
     is egged on by the planters there, and to my idea they (the
     planters) want slaves for Madagascar.I have a very mean opinion
     of the views of any colonial or foreign community: though I own
     that they are powerful for evil.Who would dare to oppose the
     European colony in Egypt or China, and remain in those
     countries?"In a letter to myself, written about this time, very much the same
views are expressed:--

     "I do not think I could enlighten _you_ about China.Her game is
     and will be to wait events, and she will try and work so as to
     embroil us with France if she does go to war.For this there
     would be plenty of elements in the Treaty Ports.One may say,
     humanly speaking, China going to war with France must entail our
     following suit.It would be a bad thing in some ways for
     civilization, for the Chinese are naturally so bumptious that any
     success would make them more so, and if allied to us, and they
     had success, it would be a bad look-out afterwards.Li Hung Chang as Emperor, if such a thing came to pass,
     would be worse than the present Emperor, for he is sharp and
     clever, would unite China under a Chinese dynasty, and be much
     more troublesome to deal with.Altogether, I cannot think that
     the world would gain if China went to war with France.Also I
     think it would be eventually bad for China.China being a queer
     country, we might expect queer things, and I believe if she did
     go to war she would contract with Americans for the destruction
     of French fleet, and she would let loose a horde of adventurers
     with dynamite.This is essentially her style of action, and Li
     Hung Chang would take it up, but do not say I think so."In a further letter from Jaffa, dated 17th November 1883, he wrote
finally on this branch of the subject:--

     "I fear I can write nothing of any import, so I will not attempt
     it.To you I can remark that if I were the Government I would
     consider the part that should be taken when the inevitable fall
     of the Mantchou dynasty takes place, what steps they would take,
     and how they would act in the break-up, which, however, will only
     end in a fresh cohesion of China, for we, or no other Power,
     could never for long hold the country.At Penang, Singapore,
     etc., the Chinese will eventually oust us in another generation."There was one other question about China upon which Gordon felt very
strongly, viz., the opium question, and as he expressed views which I
combated, I feel bound to end this chapter by quoting what he wrote on
this much-discussed topic.On one point he agrees with myself and his
other opponents in admitting that the main object with the Chinese
authorities was increased revenue, not morality.They have since
attained their object not only by an increased import duty, but also
in the far more extensive cultivation of the native drug, to which the
Emperor, by Imperial Edict, has given his formal sanction:--

                                   "PORT LOUIS, _3rd February 1882_."About the opium article, I think your article--'History of the
     Opium Traffic,' _Times_, 4th January 1884--reads well.But the
     question is this.The Chinese _amour propre_ as a nation is hurt
     by the enforced entry of the drug.This irritation is connected
     with the remembrance of the wars which led to the Treaties about
     opium.Had eggs or apples been the cause of the wars, _i.e._ had
     the Chinese objected to the import of eggs, and we had insisted
     on their being imported, and carried out such importation in
     spite of the Chinese wish by force of war, it would be to my own
     mind the same thing as opium now is to Chinese.We do not give
     the Chinese credit for being so sensitive as they are.As Black
     Sea Treaty was to Russia so opium trade is to China."I take the root of the question to be as above.I do not mean to
     say that all that they urge is fictitious about morality; and I
     would go further than you, and say I think they would willingly
     give up their revenue from opium, indeed I am sure of it, if they
     could get rid of the forced importation by treaty, but their
     action in so doing would be simply one of satisfying their _amour
     propre_.The opium importation is a constant reminder of their
     defeats, and I feel sure China will never be good friends with us
     till it is abolished.It is for that reason I would give it up,
     for I think the only two alliances worth having are France and
     China."I have never, when I have written on it, said anything further
     than this, _i.e.the Chinese Government will not have it_, let us
     say it is a good drug or not.I also say that it is not fair to
     force anything on your neighbour, and, therefore, morally, it is
     wrong, even if it was eggs."Further, I say that through our thrusting these eggs on China,
     this opium, we caused the wars with China which shook the
     prestige of the Pekin Government, and the outcome of this war of
     1842 was the Taeping Rebellion, with its deaths of 13,000,000.The military prestige of the Mantchous was shaken by these
     defeats, the heavy contributions for war led to thousands of
     soldiers being disbanded, to a general impoverishment of the
     people, and this gave the rebel chief, Hung-tsew-tsiuen, his
     chance."A wants B to let him import eggs, B refuses, A coerces him;
     therefore I say it is wrong, and that it is useless discussing
     whether eggs are good or not."Can anyone doubt but that, if the Chinese Government had the
     power, they would stop importation to-morrow?If so, why keep a
     pressure like this on China whom we need as a friend, and with
     whom this importation is and ever will be the sole point about
     which we could be at variance?I know this is the point with Li
     Hung Chang."People may laugh at _amour propre_ of China.It is a positive
     fact, they are most-pigheaded on those points.China is the only
     nation in the world which is forced to take a thing she does not
     want.England is the only nation which forces another nation to
     do this, in order to benefit India by this act.Put like this it
     is outrageous."Note this, only certain classes of vessels are subject to the
     Foreign Customs Office at Canton.By putting all vessels under
     that Office the Chinese Government would make L2,000,000 a year
     more revenue.The Chinese Government will not do this however,
     because it would put power in hands of foreigners, so they lose
     it.Did you ever read the letters of the Ambassador before
     Marquis Tseng?His name, I think, was Coh or Kwoh.He wrote home
     to Pekin about Manchester, telling its wonders, but adding,
     'These people are wonderful, but the masses are miserable far
     beyond Chinese.They think only of money and not of the welfare
     of the people.'"Any foreign nation can raise the bile of Chinese by saying,
     'Look at the English, they forced you to take their opium.'"I should not be a bit surprised did I hear that Li Hung Chang
     smoked opium himself.I know a lot of the princes do, so they
     say.I have no doubt myself that what I have said is the true and
     only reason, or rather root reason.Put our nation in the same
     position of having been defeated and forced to accept some
     article which theory used to consider bad for the health, like
     tea used to be, we would rebel as soon as we could against it,
     though our people drink tea.The opium trade is a standing,
     ever-present memento of defeat and heavy payments; and the
     Chinese cleverly take advantage of the fact that it is a
     deleterious drug."The opium wars were not about opium--opium was only a _cheval de
     bataille_.They were against the introduction of foreigners, a
     political question, and so the question of opium import is now.As for the loss to India by giving it up, it is quite another
     affair.On one hand you have gain, an embittered feeling and an
     injustice; on the other you have loss, friendly nations and
     justice.Cut down pay of all officers in India to Colonial
     allowances _above_ rank of captains.Do not give them Indian
     allowances, and you will cover nearly the loss, I expect.Why
     should officers in India have more than officers in Hongkong?"In a subsequent letter, dated from the Cape, 20th July 1882, General
Gordon replied to some objections I had raised as follows:--

     "As for the opium, to which you say the same objection applies as
     to tea, etc., it is not so, for opium has for ages been a tabooed
     article among Chinese respectable people.I own reluctance to
     foreign intercourse applies to what I said, but the Chinese know
     that the intercourse with foreigners cannot be stopped, and it,
     as well as the forced introduction of opium, are signs of defeat;
     yet one, that of intercourse, cannot be stopped or wiped away
     while the opium question can be.I am writing in a hurry, so am
     not very clear."What I mean is that no one country forces another country to
     take a drug like opium, and therefore the Chinese feel the
     forced introduction of opium as an intrusion and injustice;
     thence their feelings in the matter.This, I feel sure, is the
     case."What could our Government do _in re_ opium?Well, I should say,
     let the clause of treaty lapse about it, and let the smuggling be
     renewed."Pekin would, or rather could, never succeed in cutting off
     foreign intercourse.The Chinese are too much mixed up (and are
     increasingly so every year) with foreigners for Pekin even to try
     it.Also I do not think China would wish to stop its importation
     altogether.All they ask is an increased duty on it."CHAPTER X.

THE MAURITIUS, THE CAPE, AND THE CONGO.There was a moment of hesitation in Gordon's mind as to whether he
would come home or not.His first project on laying down the Indian
Secretaryship had been to go to Zanzibar and attack the slave trade
from that side.Before his plans were matured the China offer came,
and turned his thoughts in a different channel.On his arrival at
Aden, on the way back, he found that the late Sir William Mackinnon, a
truly great English patriot of the type of the merchant adventurers of
the Elizabethan age, had sent instructions that the ships of the
British India Steam Packet Company were at his disposal to convey him
whereever he liked, and for a moment the thought occurred to him to
turn aside to Zanzibar.But a little reflection led him to think that,
as he had been accused of insubordination, it would be better for him
to return home and report himself at headquarters.When he arrived in
London at the end of October 1880, he found that his letters, written
chiefly to his sister during his long sojourn in the Soudan, were on
the eve of publication by Dr Birkbeck Hill.That exceedingly
interesting volume placed at the disposal of the public the evidence
as to his great work in Africa, which might otherwise have been buried
in oblivion.It was written under considerable difficulties, for
Gordon would not see Dr Hill, and made a stringent proviso that he was
not to be praised, and that nothing unkind was to be said about
anyone.He did, however, stipulate for a special tribute of praise to
be given to his Arab secretary, Berzati Bey, "my only companion for
these years--my adviser and my counsellor."Berzati was among those
who perished with the ill-fated expedition of Hicks Pasha at the end
of 1883.To the publication of this work must be attributed the
establishment of Gordon's reputation as the authority on the Soudan,
and the prophetic character of many of his statements became clear
when events confirmed them.After a stay at Southampton and in London of a few weeks, Gordon was
at last induced to give himself a short holiday, and, strangely
enough, he selected Ireland as his recreation ground.I have been told
that Gordon had a strain of Irish blood in him, but I have failed to
discover it genealogically, nor was there any trace of its influence
on his character.He was not fortunate in the season of the year he
selected, nor in the particular part of the country he chose for his
visit.There is scenery in the south-west division of Ireland, quite
apart from the admitted beauty of the Killarney district, that will
vie with better known and more highly lauded places in Scotland and
Switzerland, but no one would recommend a stranger to visit that
quarter of Ireland at the end of November, and the absence of
cultivation, seen under the depressing conditions of Nature, would
strike a visitor with all the effect of absolute sterility.Gordon was
so impressed, and it seemed to him that the Irish peasants of a whole
province were existing in a state of wretchedness exceeding anything
he had seen in either China or the Soudan.If he had seen the same
places six months earlier, he would have formed a less extreme view of
their situation.It was just the condition of things that appealed to
his sympathy, and with characteristic promptitude he put his views on
paper, making one definite offer on his own part, and sent them to a
friend, the present General James Donnelly, a distinguished engineer
officer and old comrade, and moreover a member of a well-known Irish
family.Considering the contents of the letter, and the form in which
Gordon threw out his suggestions, it is not very surprising that
General Donnelly sent it to _The Times_, in which it was published on
3rd December 1880; but Gordon himself was annoyed at this step being
taken, because he realised that he had written somewhat hastily on a
subject with which he could scarcely be deemed thoroughly acquainted.The following is its text:--

     "You are aware how interested I am in the welfare of this
     country, and, having known you for twenty-six years, I am sure I
     may say the same of you."I have lately been over to the south-west of Ireland in the hope
     of discovering how some settlement could be made of the Irish
     question, which, like a fretting cancer, eats away our vitals as
     a nation."I have come to the conclusion that--

     "1.A gulf of antipathy exists between the landlords and tenants
     of the north-west, west, and south-west of Ireland.It is a gulf
     which is not caused alone by the question of rent; there is a
     complete lack of sympathy between these two classes.It is
     useless to inquire how such a state of things has come to pass.I
     call your attention to the pamphlets, letters, and speeches of
     the landlord class, as a proof of how little sympathy or kindness
     there exists among them for the tenantry, and I am sure that the
     tenantry feel in the same way towards the landlords.No half-measured Acts which left the landlords with any say
     to the tenantry of these portions of Ireland will be of any use.They would be rendered--as past Land Acts in Ireland have
     been--quite abortive, for the landlords will insert clauses to do
     away with their force.Any half-measures will only place the
     Government face to face with the people of Ireland as the
     champions of the landlord interest.The Government would be bound
     to enforce their decision, and with a result which none can
     foresee, but which certainly would be disastrous to the common
     weal.My idea is that, seeing--through this cause or that, it is
     immaterial to examine--a deadlock has occurred between the
     present landlords and tenants, the Government should purchase up
     the rights of the landlords over the whole or the greater part of
     Longford, Westmeath, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Leitrim,
     Sligo, Mayo, Cavan, and Donegal.The yearly rental of these
     districts is some four millions; if the Government give the
     landlords twenty years' purchase, it would cost eighty millions,
     which at three and a half per cent.would give a yearly interest
     of L2,800,000, of which L2,500,000 could be recovered; the lands
     would be Crown lands; they would be administered by a Land
     Commission, who would be supplemented by an Emigration
     Commission, which might for a short time need L100,000.This
     would not injure the landlords, and, so far as it is an
     interference with proprietary rights, it is as just as is the law
     which forces Lord A. to allow a railway through his park for the
     public benefit.I would restrain the landlords from any power or
     control in these Crown land districts.Poor-law, roads, schools,
     etc., should be under the Land Commission.For the rest of Ireland, I would pass an Act allowing free
     sale of leases, fair rents, and a Government valuation."In conclusion, I must say, from all accounts and my own
     observation, that the state of our fellow-countrymen in the parts
     I have named is worse than that of any people in the world, let
     alone Europe.I believe that these people are made as we are,
     that they are patient beyond belief, loyal, but, at the same
     time, broken-spirited and desperate, living on the verge of
     starvation in places in which we would not keep our cattle."The Bulgarians, Anatolians, Chinese, and Indians are better off
     than many of them are.The priests alone have any sympathy with
     their sufferings, and naturally alone have a hold over them.In
     these days, in common justice, if we endow a Protestant
     University, why should we not endow a Catholic University in a
     Catholic country?Is it not as difficult to get a L5 note from a
     Protestant as from a Catholic or Jew?Read the letters of ----
     and of ----, and tell me if you see in them any particle of kind
     feeling towards the tenantry; and if you have any doubts about
     this, investigate the manner in which the Relief Fund was
     administered, and in which the sums of money for improvements of
     estates by landlords were expended."In 1833 England gave freedom to the West Indian slaves at a cost
     of twenty millions--worth now thirty millions.This money left
     the country.By an expenditure of
     eighty millions she may free her own people.She would have the
     hold over the land, and she would cure a cancer.I am not well
     off, but I would offer ---- or his agent L1000, if either of them
     would live one week in one of these poor devil's places, and feed
     as these people do.Our comic prints do an infinity of harm by
     their caricatures--firstly, the caricatures are not true, for the
     crime in Ireland is not greater than that in England; and,
     secondly, they exasperate the people on both sides of the
     Channel, and they do no good."It is ill to laugh and scoff at a question which affects our
     existence."This heroic mode of dealing with an old and very complicated
difficulty scarcely came within the range of practical achievement.The Irish question is not to be solved by any such simple
cut-and-dried procedure.It will take time, sympathy, and good-will.When the English people have eradicated their opinion that the Irish
are an inferior race, and when the Irish realise that the old
prejudice has vanished, the root-difficulty will be removed.At least
Gordon deserves the credit of having seen that much from his brief
observation on the spot, and his plea for them as "patient beyond
belief and loyal," may eventually carry conviction to the hearts of
the more powerful and prosperous kingdom.The Irish question was not the only one on which he recorded a written
opinion.The question of retaining Candahar was very much discussed
during the winter of 1880-81, and as the Liberal Government was very
much put to it to get high military opinion to support their proposal
of abandonment, they were very glad when Gordon wrote to _The Times_
expressing a strong opinion on their side.I think the writing of that
letter was mainly due to a sense of obligation to Lord Ripon, although
the argument used as to the necessity of Candahar being held by any
_single_ ruler of Afghanistan was, and is always, unanswerable.But
the question at that time was this: Could any such single ruler be
found, and was Abdurrahman, recognised in the August of 1880 as Ameer
of Cabul, the man?On 27th July 1880, less than eight weeks after Gordon's resignation of
his Indian appointment, occurred the disastrous battle of Maiwand,
when Yakoob's younger brother, Ayoob, gained a decisive victory over a
British force.That disaster was retrieved six weeks later by Lord
Roberts, but Ayoob remained in possession of Herat and the whole of
the country west of the Helmund.It was well known that the rivalry
between him and his cousin Abdurrahman did not admit of being patched
up, and that it could only be settled by the sword.At the moment
there was more reason to believe in the military talent of Ayoob than
of the present Ameer, and it was certain that the instant we left
Candahar the two opponents would engage in a struggle for its
possession.The policy of precipitate evacuation left everything to
the chapter of accidents, and if Ayoob had proved the victor, or even
able to hold his ground, the situation in Afghanistan would have been
eminently favourable for that foreign intervention which only the
extraordinary skill and still more extraordinary success of the Ameer
Abdurrahman has averted.In giving the actual text of Gordon's letter,
it is only right, while frankly admitting that the course pursued has
proved most successful and beneficial, to record that it might well
have been otherwise, and that as a mere matter of argument the
probability was quite the other way.Neither Gordon nor any other
supporter of the evacuation policy ventured to predict that
Abdurrahman, who was then not a young man, and whose early career had
been one of failure, was going to prove himself the ablest
administrator and most astute statesman in Afghan history."Those who advocate the retention of Candahar do so generally on
     the ground that its retention would render more difficult the
     advance of Russia on, and would prevent her fomenting rebellion
     in, India, and that our prestige in India would suffer by its
     evacuation."I think that this retention would throw Afghanistan, in the hope
     of regaining Candahar, into alliance with Russia, and that
     thereby Russia would be given a temptation to offer which she
     otherwise would not have.Supposing that temptation did not
     exist, what other inducement could Russia offer for this
     alliance?If, then, Russia did advance, she
     would bring her auxiliary tribes, who, with their natural
     predatory habits, would soon come to loggerheads with their
     natural enemies, the Afghans, and that the sooner when these
     latter were aided by us.Would the Afghans in such a case be
     likely to be tempted by the small share they would get of the
     plunder of India to give up their secure, independent position
     and our alliance for that plunder, and to put their country at
     the mercy of Russia, whom they hate as cordially as they do us?If we evacuate Candahar, Afghanistan can only have this small
     inducement of the plunder of India for Russia to offer her.Some
     say that the people of Candahar desire our rule.I cannot think
     that any people like being governed by aliens in race or
     religion.They prefer their own bad native governments to a
     stiff, civilized government, in spite of the increased worldly
     prosperity the latter may give."We may be sure that at Candahar the spirit which induced
     children to kill, or to attempt to kill our soldiers in 1879,
     etc., still exists, though it may be cowed.We have trouble
     enough with the fanatics of India; why should we go out of our
     way to add to their numbers?"From a military point of view, by the retention we should
     increase the line we have to defend by twice the distance of
     Candahar to the present frontier, and place an objective point to
     be attacked.Naturally we should make good roads to Candahar,
     which on the loss of a battle there--and such things must be
     always calculated as within possibility--would aid the advance of
     the enemy to the Indus.The _debouche_ of the defiles, with good
     lateral communications between them, is the proper line of
     defence for India, not the entry into those defiles, which cannot
     have secure lateral communications.If the entries of the defiles
     are held, good roads are made through them; and these aid the
     enemy, if you lose the entries or have them turned.This does not
     prevent the passage of the defiles being disputed."The retention of Candahar would tend to foment rebellion in
     India, and not prevent it; for thereby we should obtain an
     additional number of fanatical malcontents, who as British
     subjects would have the greatest facility of passing to and fro
     in India, which they would not have if we did not hold it."That our prestige would suffer in India by the evacuation I
     doubt; it certainly would suffer if we kept it and forsook our
     word--_i.e._ that we made war against Shere Ali, and not against
     his people.The native peoples of India would willingly part with
     any amount of prestige if they obtained less taxation."India should be able, by a proper defence of her present
     frontier and by the proper government of her peoples, to look
     after herself.If the latter is wanting, no advance of frontier
     will aid her."I am not anxious about Russia; but, were I so, I would care much
     more to see precautions taken for the defence of our Eastern
     colonies, now that Russia has moved her Black Sea naval
     establishment to the China Sea, than to push forward an
     outstretched arm to Candahar.The interests of the Empire claim
     as much attention as India, and one cannot help seeing that they
     are much more imperilled by this last move of Russia than by
     anything she can do in Central Asia."Politically, militarily, and morally, Candahar ought not to be
     retained.It would oblige us to keep up an interference with the
     internal affairs of Afghanistan, would increase the expenditure
     of impoverished India, and expose us chronically to the reception
     of those painfully sensational telegrams of which we have had a
     surfeit of late."During these few months Gordon wrote on several other subjects--the
Abyssinian question, in connection with which he curiously enough
styled "the Abyssinians the best of mountaineers," a fact not
appreciated until their success over the Italians many years later,
the registration of slaves in Egypt, and the best way of carrying on
irregular warfare in difficult country and against brave and active
races.His remarks on the last subject were called forth by our
experiences in the field against the Zulus in the first place, and the
Boers in the second, and quite exceptional force was given to them by
the occurrence of the defeat at Majuba Hill one day after they
appeared in the _Army and Navy Gazette_.For this reason I quote the
article in its entirety:--

     "The individual man of any country in which active outdoor life,
     abstinence, hunting of wild game, and exposure to all weathers
     are the habits of life, is more than a match for the private
     soldier of a regular army, who is taken from the plough or from
     cities, and this is the case doubly as much when the field of
     operations is a difficult country, and when the former is, and
     the latter is not, acclimatised.On the one hand, the former is
     accustomed to the climate, knows the country, and is trained to
     long marches and difficulties of all sorts inseparable from his
     daily life; the latter is unacclimatised, knows nothing of the
     country, and, accustomed to have his every want supplied, is at a
     loss when any extraordinary hardships or difficulties are
     encountered; he has only his skill in his arms and discipline in
     his favour, and sometimes that skill may be also possessed by his
     foe.The native of the country has to contend with a difficulty
     in maintaining a long contest, owing to want of means and want of
     discipline, being unaccustomed to any yoke interfering with
     individual freedom.The resources of a regular army, in
     comparison to those of the natives of the country, are infinite,
     but it is accustomed to discipline.In a difficult country, when
     the numbers are equal, and when the natives are of the
     description above stated, the regular forces are certainly at a
     very great disadvantage, until, by bitter experience in the
     field, they are taught to fight in the same irregular way as
     their foes, and this lesson may be learnt at a great cost.I
     therefore think that when regular forces enter into a campaign
     under these conditions, the former ought to avoid any unnecessary
     haste, for time does not press with them, while every day
     increases the burden on a country without resources and
     unaccustomed to discipline, and as the forces of the country,
     unprovided with artillery, never ought to be able to attack
     fortified posts, any advance should be made by the establishment
     of such posts.All engagements in the field ought, if possible,
     to be avoided, except by corps raised from people who in their
     habits resemble those in arms, or else by irregular corps raised
     for the purpose, apart from the routine and red-tape inseparable
     from regular armies.The regular forces will act as the back-bone
     of the expedition, but the rock and cover fighting will be done
     better by levies of such specially raised irregulars.For war
     with native countries, I think that, except for the defence of
     posts, artillery is a great incumbrance, far beyond its value.It
     is a continual source of anxiety.Its transport regulates the
     speed of the march, and it forms a target for the enemy, while
     its effects on the scattered enemy is almost _nil_.An advance of
     regular troops, as at present organised, is just the sort of
     march that suits an active native foe.The regulars' column must
     be heaped together, covering its transport and artillery.The
     enemy knows the probable point of its destination on a particular
     day, and then, knowing that the regulars cannot halt definitely
     where it may be chosen to attack, it hovers round the column like
     wasps.The regulars cannot, from not being accustomed to the
     work, go clambering over rocks, or beating covers after their
     foes.Therefore I conclude that in these wars[1] regular troops
     should only act as a reserve; that the real fighting should be
     done either by native allies or by special irregular corps,
     commanded by special men, who would be untrammelled by
     regulations; that, except for the defence of posts, artillery
     should be abandoned.It may seem egotistical, but I may state
     that I should never have succeeded against native foes had I not
     had flanks, and front, and rear covered by irregular forces.Whenever either the flanks, or rear, or front auxiliaries were
     barred in their advance, we turned the regular forces on that
     point, and thus strengthening the hindered auxiliaries, drove
     back the enemy.We owed defeats, when they occurred, to the
     absence of these auxiliaries, and on two occasions to having
     cannon with the troops, which lost us 1600 men.The Abyssinians,
     who are the best of mountaineers, though they have them, utterly
     despise cannon, as they hinder their movements.I could give
     instance after instance where, in native wars, regular troops
     could not hold their own against an active guerilla, and where,
     in some cases, the disasters of the regulars were brought about
     by being hampered by cannon.No one can deny artillery may be
     most efficient in the contention of two regular armies, but it is
     quite the reverse in guerilla warfare.The inordinate haste which
     exists to finish off these wars throws away many valuable aids
     which would inevitably accrue to the regular army if time was
     taken to do the work, and far greater expense is caused by this
     hurry than otherwise would be necessary.All is done on the
     '_Veni, vidi, vici_' principle.It may be very fine, but it is
     bloody and expensive, and not scientific.I am sure it will occur
     to many, the times we have advanced, without proper breaches,
     bridges, etc., and with what loss, assaulted.It would seem that
     military science should be entirely thrown away when combating
     native tribes.I think I am correct in saying that the Romans
     always fought with large auxiliary forces of the invaded country
     or its neighbours, and I know it was the rule of the Russians in
     Circassia."[1] In allusion more particularly to the Cape and China.Perhaps Gordon was influenced by the catastrophes in South Africa when
he sent the following telegram at his own expense to the Cape
authorities on 7th April 1881: "Gordon offers his services for two
years at L700 per annum to assist in terminating war and administering
Basutoland."To this telegram he was never accorded even the courtesy
of a negative reply.It will be remembered that twelve months earlier
the Cape Government had offered him the command of the forces, and
that his reply had been to refuse.The incident is of some interest as
showing that his attention had been directed to the Basuto question,
and also that he was again anxious for active employment.His wish for
the latter was to be realised in an unexpected manner.He was staying in London when, on visiting the War Office, he casually
met the late Colonel Sir Howard Elphinstone, an officer of his own
corps, who began by complaining of his hard luck in its just having
fallen to his turn to fill the post of Engineer officer in command at
the Mauritius, and such was the distastefulness of the prospect of
service in such a remote and unattractive spot, that Sir Howard went
on to say that he thought he would sooner retire from the service.In
his impulsive manner Gordon at once exclaimed: "Oh, don't worry
yourself, I will go for you; Mauritius is as good for me as anywhere
else."The exact manner in which this exchange was brought about has
been variously described, but this is the literal version given me by
General Gordon himself, and there is no doubt that, as far as he could
regret anything that had happened, he bitterly regretted the accident
that caused him to become acquainted with the Mauritius.In a letter
to myself on the subject from Port Louis he said: "It was not over
cheerful to go out to this place, nor is it so to find a deadly sleep
over all my military friends here."In making the arrangements which
were necessary to effect the official substitution of himself for
Colonel Elphinstone, Gordon insisted on only two points: first, that
Elphinstone should himself arrange the exchange; and secondly that no
payment was to be made to him as was usual--in this case about
L800--on an exchange being effected.Sir Howard Elphinstone was thus
saved by Gordon's peculiarities a disagreeable experience and a
considerable sum of money.Some years after Gordon's death Sir Howard
met with a tragic fate, being washed overboard while taking a trip
during illness to Madeira.Like everything else he undertook, Gordon determined to make his
Mauritius appointment a reality, and although he was only in the
island twelve months, and during that period took a trip to the
interesting group of the Seychelles, he managed to compress an immense
amount of work into that short space, and to leave on record some
valuable reports on matters of high importance.He found at Mauritius
the same dislike for posts that were outside the ken of headquarters,
and the same indifference to the dry details of professional work that
drove officers of high ability and attainments to think of resigning
the service sooner than fill them, and, when they did take them, to
pass their period of exile away from the charms of Pall Mall in a
state of inaction that verged on suspended animation.In a passage
already quoted, he refers to the deadly sleep of his military friends,
and then he goes on to say in a sentence, which cannot be too much
taken to heart by those who have to support this mighty empire, with
enemies on every hand--"We are in a perfect Fools' Paradise about our
power.We have plenty of power if we would pay attention to our work,
but the fault is, to my mind, the military power of the country is
eaten up by selfishness and idleness, and we are trading on the
reputation of our forefathers.When one sees by the newspapers the
Emperor of Germany sitting, old as he is, for two long hours
inspecting his troops, and officers here grudging two hours a week for
their duties, one has reason to fear the future."During his stay at Mauritius he wrote three papers of first-rate
importance.One of them on Egyptian affairs after the deposition of
Ismail may be left for the next chapter, and the two others, one on
coaling stations in the Indian Ocean, and the second on the
comparative merits of the Cape and Mediterranean routes come within
the scope of this chapter, and are, moreover, deserving of special
consideration.With regard to the former of these two important
subjects, Gordon wrote as follows, but I cannot discover that anything
has been done to give practical effect to his recommendations:--

     "I spoke to you concerning Borneo and the necessity for coaling
     stations in the Eastern seas.Taking Mauritius with its large
     French population, the Cape with its conflicting elements, and
     Hongkong, Singapore, and Penang with their vast Chinese
     populations, who may be with or against us, but who are at any
     time a nuisance, I would select such places where no temptation
     would induce colonists to come, and I would use them as maritime
     fortresses.For instance, the only good coaling place between
     Suez and Adelaide would be in the Chagos group, which contain a
     beautiful harbour at San Diego.My object is to secure this for
     the strengthening of our maritime power.These islands are of
     great strategical importance _vis a vis_ with India, Suez, and
     Singapore.Remember Aden has no harbour to speak of, and has the
     need of a garrison, while Chagos could be kept by a company of
     soldiers.It is wonderful our people do not take the views of our
     forefathers.They took up their positions at all the salient
     points of the routes.We can certainly hold these places, but
     from the colonial feelings they have almost ceased to be our own.By establishing these coaling stations no diplomatic
     complications could arise, while by their means we could unite
     all our colonies with us, for we could give them effective
     support.The spirit of no colony would bear up for long against
     the cutting off of its trade, which would happen if we kept
     watching the Mediterranean and neglected the great ocean routes.The cost would not be more than these places cost now, if the
     principle of heavily-armed, light-draught, swift gunboats with
     suitable arsenals, properly (not over) defended, were followed."Chagos as well as Seychelles forms part of the administrative group of
the Mauritius.The former with, as Gordon states, an admirable port in
San Diego, lies in the direct route to Australia from the Red Sea, and
the latter contains an equally good harbour in Port Victoria Mahe.The
Seychelles are remarkably healthy islands--thirty in number--and
Gordon recommended them as a good place for "a man with a little money
to settle in."He also advanced the speculative and somewhat
imaginative theory that in them was to be found the true site of the
Garden of Eden.The views Gordon expressed in 1881 as to the diminished importance of
the Mediterranean as an English interest, and the relative superiority
of the Cape over the Canal route, on the ground of its security, were
less commonly held then than they have since become.Whether they are
sound is not to be taken on the trust of even the greatest of
reputations; and in so complicated and many-sided a problem it will be
well to consider all contingencies, and to remember that there is no
reason why England should not be able in war-time to control them
both, until at least the remote epoch when Palestine shall be a
Russian possession."I think Malta has very much lost its importance.The
     Mediterranean now differs much from what it was in 1815.Other
     nations besides France possess in it great dockyards and
     arsenals, and its shores are backed by united peoples.Any war
     with Great Britain in the Mediterranean with any one Power would
     inevitably lead to complications with neutral nations.Steam has
     changed the state of affairs, and has brought the Mediterranean
     close to every nation of Europe.War in the Mediterranean is _war
     in a basin_, the borders of which are in the hands of other
     nations, all pretty powerful and interested in trade, and all
     likely to be affected by any turmoil in that basin, and to be
     against the makers of such turmoil.In fact, the Mediterranean
     trade is so diverted by the railroads of Europe, that it is but
     of small importance.The trade which is of value is the trade
     east of Suez, which, passing through the Canal, depends upon its
     being kept open.If the entrance to the Mediterranean were
     blocked at Gibraltar by a heavy fleet, I cannot see any advantage
     to be gained against us by the fleets blocked up in it--at any
     rate I would say, let our _first care_ be for the Cape route, and
     secondly for the Mediterranean and Canal.The former route
     entails no complications, the latter endless ones, coupled with a
     precarious tenure.Look at the Mediterranean, and see how small
     is that sea on which we are apparently devoting the greater part
     of our attention.The
     Resident, according to existing orders, reports to Bombay, and
     Bombay to _that_ Simla Council, which knows and cares nothing
     for the question.A special regiment should be raised for its
     protection."While stationed in the Mauritius, Gordon attained the rank of
Major-General in the army, and another colonel of Engineers was sent
out to take his place.During the last three months of his residence
he filled, in addition to his own special post, that of the command of
all the troops on the station, and at one time it seemed as if he
might have been confirmed in the appointment.But this was not done,
owing, as he suggested, to the "determination not to appoint officers
of the Royal Artillery or Engineers to any command;" but a more
probable reason was that Gordon had been inquiring about and had
discovered that the colonists were not only a little discontented, but
had some ground for their discontent.By this time Gordon's
uncompromising sense of justice was beginning to be known in high
official quarters, and the then responsible Government had far too
many cares on its shoulders that could not be shirked to invite others
from so remote and unimportant a possession as the Mauritius.Even before any official decision could have been arrived at in this
matter, fate had provided him with another destination.Two passages have already been cited, showing the overtures first made
by the Cape Government, and then by Gordon himself, for his employment
in South Africa.On 23rd
February 1882, when an announcement was made by myself that Gordon
would vacate his command in a few weeks' time, the Cape Government
again expressed its desire to obtain the use of his services, and
moreover recollected the telegram to which no reply had been sent.Sir
Hercules Robinson, then Governor of the Cape, sent the following
telegram to the Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Kimberley:--

     "Ministers request me to inquire whether H.M.'s Government would
     permit them to obtain the services of Colonel Charles Gordon.Ministers desire to invite Colonel Gordon to come to this Colony
     for the purpose of consultation as to the best measures to be
     adopted with reference to Basutoland, in the event of Parliament
     sanctioning their proposals as to that territory, and to engage
     his services, should he be willing to renew the offer made to
     their predecessors in April 1881, to assist in terminating the
     war and administering Basutoland."Lord Kimberley then sent instructions by telegraph to Durban, and
thence by steamer, sanctioning Gordon's employment and his immediate
departure from the Mauritius.The increasing urgency of the Basuto
question induced the Cape Government to send a message by telegraph to
Aden, and thence by steamer direct to Gordon.In this message they
stated that "the services of some one of proved ability, firmness, and
energy," were required; that they did not expect Gordon to be bound by
the salary named in his own telegram, and that they begged him to
visit the Colony "at once"--repeating the phrase twice.All these
messages reached Gordon's hands on 2nd April.Two days later he
started in the sailing vessel _Scotia_, no other ship being
obtainable.The Cape authorities had therefore no ground to complain of the
dilatoriness of the man to whom they appealed in their difficulty,
although their telegram was despatched 3rd of March, and Gordon did
not reach Cape Town before the 3rd of May.It will be quite understood
that Gordon had offered in the first place, and been specially invited
in the second place, to proceed to the Cape, for the purpose of
dealing with the difficulty in Basutoland.He was to find that, just
as his mission to China had been complicated by extraneous
circumstances, so was his visit to the Cape to be rendered more
difficult by Party rivalries, and by work being thrust upon him which
he had several times refused to accept, and for the efficient
discharge of which, in his own way, he knew he would never obtain the
requisite authority.Before entering upon this matter a few words may be given to the
financial agreement between himself and the Cape Government.The first
office in 1880 had carried with it a salary of L1500; in 1881 Gordon
had offered to go for L700; in 1882 the salary was to be a matter of
arrangement, and on arrival at Cape Town he was offered L1200 a year.He refused to accept more than L800 a year; but as he required and
insisted on having a secretary, the other L400 was assigned for that
purpose.In naming such a small and inadequate salary Gordon was under
the mistaken belief that his imperial pay of L500 a year would
continue, but, unfortunately for him, a new regulation, 25th June
1881, had come into force while he was buried away in the Mauritius,
and he was disqualified from the receipt of the income he had earned.Gordon was very indignant, more especially because it was clear that
he was doing public service at the Cape, while, as he said with some
bitterness, if he had started an hotel or become director of a
company, his pay would have gone on all the same.The only suggestion
the War Office made was that he should ask the Cape Government to
compensate him, but this he indignantly refused.In the result all his
savings during the Mauritius command were swallowed up, and I believe
I understate the amount when I say that his Cape experience cost him
out of his own pocket from first to last five hundred pounds.That sum
was a very considerable one to a man who never inherited any money,
and who went through life scorning all opportunities of making it.But on this occasion he vindicated a principle, and showed that
"money was not his object."As Gordon went to the Cape specially for the purpose of treating the
Basutoland question, it may be well to describe briefly what that
question was.Basutoland is a mountainous country, difficult of
access, but in resources self-sufficing, on the eastern side of the
Orange Free State, and separated from Natal and Kaffraria, or the
Transkei division of Cape Colony, by the sufficiently formidable
Drakensberg range.Its population consisted of 150,000 stalwart and
freedom-loving Highlanders, ruled by four chiefs--Letsea, Masupha,
Molappo, and Lerothodi, with only the three first of whom had Gordon
in any way to deal.Notwithstanding their numbers, courage, and the
natural strength of their country, they owed their safety from
absorption by the Boers to British protection, especially in 1868, and
they were taken over by us as British subjects without any formality
three years later.They do not seem to have objected so long as the
tie was indefinite, but when in 1880 it was attempted to enforce the
regulations of the Peace Preservation Act by disarming these clans,
then the Basutos began a pronounced and systematic opposition.Letsea
and Lerothodi kept up the pretence of friendliness, but Masupha
fortified his chief residence at Thaba Bosigo, and openly prepared for
war.That war had gone on for two years without result, and the total
cost of the Basuto question had been four millions sterling when
Gordon was summoned to the scene.Having given this general
description of the question, it will be well to state the details of
the matters in dispute, as set forth by Gordon after he had examined
all the papers and heard the evidence of the most competent and
well-informed witnesses.His memorandum, dated 26th May 1882, read as follows:--

     "In 1843 the Basuto chiefs entered into a treaty with Her
     Majesty's Government, by which the limits of Basutoland were
     recognised roughly in 1845.The Basuto chiefs agreed by
     convention with Her Majesty's Government to a concession of land
     on terminable leases, on the condition that Her Majesty's
     Government should protect them from Her Majesty's subjects."In 1848 the Basuto chiefs agreed to accept the Sovereignty of
     Her Majesty the Queen, on the understanding that Her Majesty's
     Government would restrain Her Majesty's subjects in the
     territories they possessed."Between 1848 and 1852, notwithstanding the above treaties, a
     large portion of Basutoland was annexed by the proclamation of
     Her Majesty's Government, and this annexation was accompanied by
     hostilities, which were afterwards decided by Sir George Cathcart
     as being undertaken in support of unjustifiable aggression."In 1853, notwithstanding the treaties, Basutoland was abandoned,
     leaving its chiefs to settle as they could with the Europeans of
     the Free State who were settled in Basutoland and were mixed up
     with the Basuto people."In 1857, the Basutos asked Her Majesty's Government to arbitrate
     and settle their quarrels."In 1858 the Free State interfered to protect their settlers, and
     a war ensued, and the Free State was reduced to great
     extremities, and asked Her Majesty's Government to mediate.This
     was agreed to, and a frontier line was fixed by Her Majesty's
     Government."In 1865 another war broke out between the Free State and the
     Basutos, at the close of which the Basutos lost territory, and
     were accepted as British subjects by Her Majesty's Government for
     the second time, being placed under the direct government of Her
     Majesty's High Commissioner."In 1871 Basutoland was annexed to the _Crown_ Colony of the Cape
     of Good Hope, without the Basutos having been consulted."In 1872 the _Crown_ Colony became a colony with a responsible
     Government, and the Basutos were placed virtually under another
     power.The Basutos asked for representation in the Colonial
     Parliament, which was refused, and to my mind here was the
     mistake committed which led to these troubles."Then came constant disputes, the Disarmament Act, the Basuto
     War, and present state of affairs."From this chronology there are four points that stand out in
     relief:--

     "1.That the Basuto people, who date back generations, made
     treaties with the British Government, which treaties are equally
     binding, whether between two powerful states, or between a
     powerful state and a weak one.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos lost land.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos, without being
     consulted or having their rights safeguarded, were handed over to
     another power--the Colonial Government.That that other power proceeded to enact their disarmament, a
     process which could only be carried out with a servile race, like
     the Hindoos of the plains of India, and which any one of
     understanding must see would be resisted to the utmost by any
     people worth the name; the more so in the case of the Basutos,
     who realised the constant contraction of their frontiers in
     defiance of the treaties made with the British Government, and
     who could not possibly avoid the conclusion that this disarmament
     was only a prelude to their extinction."The necessary and inevitable result of the four deductions was
     that the Basutos resisted, and remain passively resisting to this
     day."The fault lay in the British Government not having consulted the
     Basutos, their co-treaty power, when they handed them over to the
     Colonial Government.They should have called together a national
     assembly of the Basuto people, in which the terms of the transfer
     could have been quietly arranged, and this I consider is the root
     of all the troubles, and expenses, and miseries which have sprung
     up; and therefore, as it is always best to go to the root of any
     malady, I think it would be as well to let bygones be bygones,
     and to commence afresh by calling together by proclamation a
     Pitso of the whole tribe, in order to discuss the best means of
     sooner securing the settlement of the country.I think that some
     such proclamation should be issued.By this Pitso we would know
     the exact position of affairs, and the real point in which the
     Basutos are injured or considered themselves to be injured."To those who wish for the total abandonment of Basutoland, this
     course must be palatable; to those who wish the Basutos well, and
     desire not to see them exterminated, it must also be palatable;
     and to those who hate the name of Basutoland it must be
     palatable, for it offers a solution which will prevent them ever
     hearing the name again."This Pitso ought to be called at once.All Colonial officials
     ought to be absent, for what the colony wants is to know what is
     the matter; and the colony wishes to know it from the Basuto
     people, irrespective of the political parties of the Government."Such a course would certainly recommend itself to the British
     Government, and to its masters--the British people."Provided the demands of the Basutos--who will, for their own
     sakes, never be for a severing of their connection with the
     colony, in order to be eventually devoured by the Orange Free
     State--are such as will secure the repayment to the colony of all
     expenses incurred by the Colonial Government in the maintenance
     of this connection, and I consider that the Colonial Government
     should accept them."With respect to the Loyals, there are some 800 families, the
     cost of keeping whom is on an average one shilling per diem each
     family, that is L40 per diem, or L1200 per month, and they have
     been rationed during six months at cost of L7200.Their claims
     may therefore be said to be some L80,000.Now, if these 800
     families (some say half) have claims amounting to L30 each
     individually (say 400 families at L30), L12,000 paid at once
     would rid the colony of the cost of subsistence of these
     families, viz.L600 a month (the retention of them would only add
     to the colonial expenditure, and tend to pauperise them)."I believe that L30,000 paid at once to the Loyals would reduce
     their numbers to one-fourth what they are now.It is proposed to
     send up a Commission to examine into their claims; the Commission
     will not report under two months, and there will be the delay of
     administration at Cape Town, during all which time L1200 a month
     are being uselessly expended by the colony, detrimentally to the
     Loyals.Therefore I recommend (1) that the sum of L30,000 should
     be at once applied to satisfy the minor claims of the Loyals; (2)
     that this should be done at once, at same time as the meeting of
     the National Pitso."The effect of this measure in connection with the meeting of the
     National Pitso would be very great, for it would be a positive
     proof of the good disposition of the Colonial Government.The
     greater claims could, if necessary, wait for the Parliamentary
     Commission, but I would deprecate even this delay, and though for
     the distribution of the L30,000 I would select those on whom the
     responsibility of such distribution could be put, without
     reference to the Colonial Government, for any larger sums perhaps
     the colonial sanction should be taken."I urge that this measure of satisfying the Loyals is one that
     presses and cannot well wait months to be settled."In conclusion, I recommend (1) that a National Pitso be held;
     (2) that the Loyals should at once be paid off."I feel confident that by the recommendation No.1 nothing could
     be asked for detrimental to colonial interests, whose Government
     would always have the right of amending or refusing any demands,
     and that by recommendation No.2 a great moral effect would be
     produced at once, and some heavy expenses saved."Attached to this memorandum was the draft of a proclamation to the
chiefs, etc., of Basutoland, calling on them to meet in Pitso or
National Assembly without any agent of the Colonial Government being
present.It was not very surprising that such a policy of fairness and
consideration for Basuto opinion, because so diametrically opposite to
everything that Government had been doing, should have completely
taken the Cape authorities aback, nor were its chances of being
accepted increased by Gordon entrusting it to Mr Orpen, whose policy
in the matter had been something more than criticised by the Ministers
at that moment in power at the Cape.Gordon's despatch was in the
hands of the Cape Premier early in June, and the embarrassment he felt
at the ability and force with which the Basuto side of the question
was put by the officer, who was to settle the matter for the Cape
Government, was so great that, instead of making any reply, he passed
it on to Lord Kimberley and the Colonial Office for solution.It was
not until the 7th of August that an answer was vouchsafed to Gordon on
what was, after all, the main portion of his task in South Africa.In
the interval Gordon was employed on different military and
administrative matters, for he had had thrust on him as a temporary
charge the functions of Commandant-General of the Cape forces, which
he had never wished to accept, but it will be clearer to the reader to
follow to the end the course of his Basuto mission, which was the
essential cause of his presence in South Africa.On the 18th July the Ministers requested Gordon to go up to
Basutoland.At that moment, and indeed for more than three weeks
later, Gordon had received no reply to the detailed memorandum already
quoted.He responded to this request with the draft of a convention
that would "save the susceptibilities of Mr Orpen between whom and
Masupha any _entente_ would seem impossible."The basis of that
convention was to be the semi-independence of the Basutos, but its
full text must be given in order to show the consistency, as well as
the simplicity, of Gordon's proposed remedy of a question that had
gone on for years without any prospect of termination.CONVENTION BETWEEN COLONY, CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, AND THE CHIEF AND
                            PEOPLE OF BASUTOLAND."The Colonial Government having nominated as their
     representatives, Colonel C. Griffiths and Dr J. W. Matthews, the
     Basuto nation having nominated the Chief Letsea Moshesh and
     Masupha Moshesh as their representatives, the following
     convention has been agreed upon between these representatives:--

     "Art.There shall be a complete amnesty on both sides to all
     who have taken part in the late hostilities.The question of the succession to Molappo Moshesh's
     chieftainship shall be decided by the Chief of the Basuto Nation.The Colonial Government engages to respect the integrity
     of the Basuto nation within the limits to be hereafter decided
     upon, and also to use its best endeavours to have these limits
     respected by the Orange Free State.The Colonial Government will appoint a Resident to the
     Basuto nation, with two sub-residents.The Resident will consult
     with the leading Chief of the Basuto Nation on all measures
     concerning the welfare of that country, but the government of the
     Basutos in all internal affairs will remain under the
     jurisdiction of the chiefs.The Supreme Council of Basutoland will consist of the
     leading chiefs and the Resident; the minor chiefs of Basutoland
     will form a council with the sub-residents.These minor councils
     can be appealed against by any non-content to the Supreme
     Council.A hut-tax will be collected of 10s.per hut by the
     chiefs, and will be paid to the Resident and sub-resident.The
     sum thus collected will be used in paying the Resident L2000 a
     year, all included: the sub-residents L1200 a year, all included;
     in providing for the education of people (now costing L3320 a
     year); in making roads, etc.The chiefs collecting hut-tax will be paid 10 per cent.The frontier line will be placed under headmen, who will
     be responsible that no thieving be permitted, that spoors are
     followed up.For this these headmen will be paid at the rate of
     L20 to L60 per annum, according to the length of frontier they
     are responsible for.All passes must be signed by Residents or sub-residents
     for the Orange Free State, or for the Cape Colony."_Query_--Would it be advisable to add chiefs and missionaries
     after sub-residents?Colonial warrants will be valid in Basutoland, the
     chiefs being responsible that prisoners are given up to Resident
     or sub-residents.All communications between Basutoland and the Orange
     Free State to be by and through the Resident.This Convention to be in quadruplicate, two copies
     being in possession of the Colonial Government, and two copies in
     possession of the Basuto chiefs.On signature of this Convention, and on the fulfilment
     of Art.1, amnesty clause, the Colonial Government agrees to
     withdraw the military forces and the present magisterial
     administration."To this important communication no answer was ever vouchsafed, but on
7th August, long after it was in the hands of Ministers, Mr Thomas
Scanlan, the Premier, wrote a long reply to the earlier memorandum of
26th May.The writer began by quoting Lord Kimberley's remarks on that
memorandum, which were as follows:--

     "I have received the memorandum on the Basuto question by
     Major-General Gordon.I do not think it necessary to enter upon a
     discussion of the policy suggested in this memorandum, but it
     will doubtless be borne in mind by your Ministers that, as I
     informed you by my telegram of the 6th of May last, H.M.'s
     Government cannot hold out any expectation that steps will be
     taken by them to relieve the colony of its responsibilities in
     Basutoland."The interpretation placed, and no doubt correctly placed, on that
declaration of Government policy was that under no circumstances was
it prepared to do anything in the matter, and that it had quite a
sufficient number of troubles and worries without the addition of one
in remote and unimportant Basutoland.Having thus got out of the
necessity of discussing this important memorandum, under the cloak of
the Colonial Office's decision in favour of inaction, the Premier went
on to say that he was "most anxious to avoid the resumption of
hostilities on the one hand or the abandonment of the territory on the
other."There was an absolute ignoring in this statement of Gordon's
deliberate opinion that the only way to solve the difficulty was by
granting Basutoland semi-independence on the terms of a Convention
providing for the presence of a British Resident, through whom all
external matters were to be conducted.At the same time Mr Scanlan
informed Gordon that he was sending up Mr Sauer, then Secretary for
Native Affairs, who was a nominee of Mr Orpen, the politician whose
policy was directly impugned.On Mr Sauer reaching King William's Town, where Gordon was in
residence at the Grand Depot of the Cape forces, he at once asked him
to accompany him to Basutoland.Gordon at first declined to do this on
two grounds, viz.that he saw no good could ensue unless the
convention were granted, and also that he did not wish Mr Sauer, or
any other representative of the Cape Government, as a companion,
because he had learnt that "Masupha would only accept his proposed
visit as a private one, and then only with his private secretary and
two servants."After some weeks' hesitation Gordon was induced by Mr Sauer to so far
waive his objection as to consent to accompany him to Letsea's
territory.This Basuto chief kept up the fiction of friendly relations
with the Cape, but after Gordon had personally interviewed him, he
became more than ever convinced that all the Basuto chiefs were in
league.Mr Sauer was of opinion that Letsea and the other chiefs might
be trusted to attack and able to conquer Masupha.There was no
possibility of reconciling these clashing views, but Gordon also
accompanied Mr Sauer to Leribe, the chief town of Molappo's territory,
north of, and immediately adjoining that of, Masupha.Here Gordon
found fresh evidence as to the correctness of his view, that all the
Basuto leaders were practically united, and he wrote a memorandum,
dated 16th September, which has not been published, showing the
hopelessness of getting one chief to coerce the others.Notwithstanding the way he had been treated by the Cape Government,
which had ignored all his suggestions, Gordon, in his intense desire
to do good, and his excessive trust in the honour of other persons,
yielded to Mr Sauer's request to visit Masupha, and not only yielded
but went without any instructions or any prior agreement that his
views were to prevail.The consequence was that Mr Sauer deliberately
resolved to destroy Gordon's reputation as a statesman, and to ensure
the triumph of his own policy by an act of treachery that has never
been surpassed.While Gordon went as a private visitor at the special invitation of
Masupha to that chief's territory, Mr Sauer, who was well acquainted
with Gordon's views, and also the direct author of Gordon's visit at
that particular moment, incited Letsea to induce Lerothodi to attack
Masupha.At the moment that the news of this act of treachery reached
Masupha's ears, Gordon was a guest in Masupha's camp, and the first
construction placed upon events by that chief was, that Gordon had
been sent up to hoodwink and keep him quiet, while a formidable
invasion was plotted of his territory.When Masupha reported this news
to Gordon, he asked what he advised him to do, and it has been
established that the object of the question was to ascertain how far
Gordon was privy to the plot.Gordon's candid reply--"Refuse to have
any dealings with the Government until the forces are withdrawn," and
his general demeanour, which showed unaffected indignation, convinced
Masupha of his good faith and innocence of all participation in the
plot.A very competent witness, Mr Arthur Pattison (letter in _The Times_,
20th August 1885), bears this testimony: "Gordon divined his character
marvellously, and was the only man Masupha had the slightest regard
for.Masupha, if you treat him straightforwardly, is as nice a man as
possible, and even kind and thoughtful; but, if you treat him the
other way, he is a fiend incarnate."Had Masupha not been thus convinced, Gordon's death was decided on,
and never in the whole course of his career, not even when among the
Taepings on the day of the Wangs' murder in Soochow, nor among
Suleiman's slave-hunters at Shaka, was he in greater peril than when
exposed by the treacherous proceedings of Sauer and Orpen to the wrath
of Masupha.On his return in safety he at once sent in his
resignation, but those who played him false not merely never received
their deserts for an unpardonable breach of faith to a loyal
colleague, but have been permitted by a lax public opinion at the Cape
to remain in the public service, and are now discharging high and
responsible duties.Gordon's mission to the leading Basuto chief, and the policy of
conciliation which he consistently and ably advocated from the
beginning to the end of his stay at the Cape, were thus failures, but
they failed, as an impartial writer like Mr Gresswell says, solely
because "of Mr Sauer's intrigues behind his back."It is only
necessary to add what Gordon himself wrote on this subject on his
return, and to record that practically the very policy he advocated
was carried into force, not by the Cape Government, but over its head
by the British Government, two years later, in the separation of
Basutoland from the Cape Colony, and by placing it in its old direct
dependence under the British Crown."I have looked over the Cape papers; the only thing that is
     misrepresented, so far as I could see in a ten minutes' glance at
     them, is that Sauer says I knew of his intentions of sending an
     expedition against Masupha.He puts it thus: 'Gordon knew that an
     expedition was being organised against Masupha.'He gives
     apparently three witnesses that I knew well.It is quite true;
     but read the words._I knew Sauer was going_ to try the useless
     expedient of an expedition against Masupha, and _before he did
     so_ we _agreed I should go and try and make peace_.While
     carrying on this peace mission, Sauer sends the expedition.So
     you see he is verbally correct; yet the deduction is false; in
     fact, who would ever go up with peace overtures to a man who was
     to be attacked during those overtures, as Masupha was?Garcia
     knew well enough what a surprise it was to him and me when we
     heard Sauer was sending the expedition.Garcia was with me at the
     time."And again, when at Jaffa, General Gordon adds further, on the 27th of
July 1883:--

     "I saw Masupha one day at 10 A.M., and spoke to him; Sauer was
     twenty miles away.I came back, and wrote to Sauer an
     account of what had passed; before I sent it off I received a
     letter from Sauer.I believe it is wished to be made out that
     Sauer wrote this letter after he had heard what had passed
     between Masupha and me.This is not the case, for Sauer, having
     let me go to Masupha, changed his mind and wrote the letter, but
     this letter had nothing to do with my interview with Masupha."With this further quotation of Gordon's own words I may conclude the
description of the Basuto mission, which, although deemed a failure at
the time, was eventually the direct cause of the present
administrative arrangement in that important district of South Africa."In order you should understand the position of affairs, I recall
     to your memory the fact that Scanlan, Merriman, and yourself all
     implied to me doubts of Orpen's policy and your desire to remove
     him; that I deprecated any such change in my favour; that I
     accepted the post of Commandant-General on Merriman's statement
     that the Government desired me to eradicate the red-tape system
     of the colonial forces; that I made certain reports to the
     Government upon the settlement of the Basuto question in May and
     July, showing my views; that the Government were aware of the
     great difference between my views and those of Orpen, both by
     letter and verbally to Merriman; also to my objections to go up.Sauer was told by me the same thing.I conversed with him _en
     route_, and I told him if I visited Masupha I could not
     afterwards fight him, for I would not go and spy upon his
     defences.Sauer asked me to go to Masupha; he knew my views; yet
     when I was there negotiating, he, or rather Orpen, moved
     Lerothodi to attack Masupha, who would, I believe, have come to
     terms respecting the acceptance of magistrates, a modified
     hut-tax, and border police.The reported movement of Lerothodi
     prevented my coming to any arrangement.I told Masupha, when he
     sent and told me of Lerothodi's advance, not to answer the
     Government until the hostile movements had ceased.The Government
     sent me up, knowing my views, and against my wish, and knowing I
     was not likely to mince matters.There are not more than two
     Europeans in Basutoland who believe in Orpen or his policy, while
     the natives have lost all confidence in him.Sauer shut his eyes
     to all this, and has thrown in his lot with Orpen.Masupha is a
     sincere man, and he does not care to have placed with him
     magistrates, against whom are complaints, which Sauer ignores.To
     show you I was in earnest, I offered to remain as magistrate with
     Masupha for two years, so much did I desire a settlement of the
     Basuto question.I did not want nor would I have taken the post
     of Governor's Agent.The chiefs and people desire peace, but not
     at any price.They have intelligence enough to see through
     wretched magistrates like some of those sent up into the native
     territories.They will accept a convention like the one I sent
     down to the Colonial Secretary on the 19th of July, and no other.I do not write this to escape being a scapegoat--in fact, I like
     the altar--only that you may know my views.As long as the
     present magistrates stay there, no chance exists for any
     arrangement.As to the Premier's remark that I would not fight
     against Masupha, is it likely I could fight against a man with
     whom I am life and soul?Would I fight against him because he
     would not be controlled by some men like ---- and ----?Even
     suppose I could sink my conscience to do so, what issue would
     result from the action of undisciplined and insubordinate troops,
     who are difficult to keep in order during peace-time, and about
     whom, when I would have made an example of one officer, a
     Minister telegraphs to me to let him down easy.I beg to recall
     to you that Her Majesty's Government disapproved of the former
     Basuto war; therefore, why should I, who am an outsider to the
     colony, even pretend I could make war against a noble people, who
     resist magistrates of no capacity?The Government were well
     warned by me, and they cannot, therefore, plead being led
     astray."Intimately connected with the Basuto question was the larger one of
the right treatment to be generally extended to the natives, and on
that subject General Gordon drew up, on 19th October 1882, the
following masterly note, which elicited the admiration of one of the
Cape Premiers, Mr Merriman, who said--"As a Colony we must try to
follow out the ideas sketched by General Gordon."The following is the full text of this interesting and valuable state
paper:--

                           THE NATIVE QUESTION.The native question of South Africa is not a difficult one to
     an outsider.The difficulty lies in procuring a body of men who
     will have strength of purpose to carry out a definite policy with
     respect to the natives.The strained relations which exist between the colonist and
     the native are the outcome of employing, as a rule, magistrates
     lacking in tact, sympathy, and capacity to deal with the natives,
     in the Government not supervising the action of these
     magistrates, and in condoning their conduct, while acknowledging
     those faults which come to their cognisance.The Colonial Government act in the nomination of native
     magistrates as if their duties were such as any one could
     fulfil, instead of being, as they are, duties requiring the
     greatest tact and judgment.There can be no doubt but that in a
     great measure, indeed one may say entirely, disturbances among
     the natives are caused by the lack of judgment, or of honesty, or
     of tact, on the part of the magistrates in the native
     territories.There may be here and there good magistrates, but
     the defects of the bad ones re-act on the good ones.Revolt is
     contagious and spreads rapidly among the natives.One may say no supervision, in the full sense of the term,
     exists over the actions of magistrates in native territories.They report to headquarters what suits them, but unless some very
     flagrant injustice is brought to light, which is often condoned,
     the Government know nothing.The consequence is that a continual
     series of petty injustices rankle in the minds of the natives,
     eventually breaking out into a revolt, in the midst of which
     Government does not trouble to investigate the causes of such
     revolt, but is occupied in its suppression.The history of the
     South African wars is essentially, as Sir G. Cathcart puts it,
     "Wars undertaken in support of unjustifiable acts."Sir Harry
     Smith was recalled for supporting an inefficient official of the
     now Free State Territory.Any one who chooses can investigate the
     causes of the late wars, and will find out that they arose in a
     great measure from the ignorance of the Government, their support
     of incapable officials, and their weakness in not investigating
     causes before they proceeded to coercion.The Duke of
     Wellington said that any fool could govern by that means.And it
     is still more rotten when Government governs by the rule of
     coercion without the power of coercion except at great expense.A properly constituted Commission of independent men
     proceeding to the native territories, not accepting the
     hospitality of those whose conduct they _go_ to investigate, not
     driving through the territories in hot haste, as is the manner of
     some Ministers, but a Commission who would patiently and
     fearlessly inquire into every detail of administration, into
     every grievance, is the _sine qua non_ of any quiet in the native
     territories.This Commission should detail on brass plates the
     _modus vivendi_, the limits of territory of each district chief,
     and a body of trustees should be appointed to watch over any
     infraction of such charter.It must be borne in mind that these native territories cost
     the Colony for administration some L9000 per annum for
     administration of magistracies; the receipts are some L3000,
     leaving a deficit of some L6000 per annum.To this deficit has to
     be added some L150,000 for regular troops.The last rebellion of
     Transkei ended in capture of some L60,000 worth of cattle, and
     that from natives of Colony driven into rebellion, and cost
     Government of Colony with Basuto war nearly L4,000,000.It is
     surely worth while, from a financial point of view, to
     investigate the administration of the Transkei.The present state of the Transkei is one of seething
     discontent and distrust which the rivalry of the tribes alone
     prevents breaking out into action, to be quelled again at great
     expense and by the ruin of the people, and upset of all
     enterprise to open up the country.Throughout the Transkei is one
     general clamour against the Government for broken promises, for
     promises made and never kept.Magistrates complain no answers are
     given to their questions; things are allowed to drift along as
     best they can.A fair open policy towards the Pondos would obtain
     from them all the Colony could require, but as things are now,
     the Pondos are full of distrust, and only want the chance to turn
     against the Colony.There are in Transkei 399,000 natives, and
     2800 Europeans.Therefore, for the benefit of these 2800
     Europeans, 399,000 natives are made miserable, and an expenditure
     of L210,000 is incurred by the Colony with the probability of
     periodical troubles.However disagreeable it might be, the Commission of
     Investigation should inquire into the antecedents of each
     magistrate, and also his capabilities.With respect to Basutoland, it is understood that no revenue
     from that country is to go to the Colony, therefore it can be no
     object to Colony to insist on the installation of magistrates in
     that country.If the magistrates of Transkei are the cause of
     discontent among the natives, then what object is there in
     insisting on their installation in Basutoland?The Pondos, a far
     inferior people, are happy under their own chiefs--far happier
     than the natives of Transkei.Why should the Colony insist on
     sending men who are more likely to goad the Basutos into
     rebellion than anything else?The administration of Basutoland is
     on a scale costing L30,000 per annum.It is argued that should the Colony go to war with Masupha
     the other chiefs would hold aloof.A war
     with Masupha means a war with the Basuto nation, with a rising in
     the Transkei, and perhaps in Pondoland, and would affect Natal
     and Her Majesty's Government.The only remedy is the sending up of his Excellency the
     Governor, or of some high neutral officer, to Basutoland, and the
     calling together of the people to decide on their future
     government and connection with Colony.Or, should the British
     Government refuse this small concession, which could not involve
     it, then the Colony should send up an independent Commission to
     meet the Basuto people, and arrange a _modus vivendi_.Whichever
     course is followed it is a _sine qua non_ that the present
     officials in Basutoland should be relieved at once, as they have
     lost the confidence both of Europeans and natives.The Basutos
     desire peace, and it is an error to describe their demeanour as
     aggressive.It is not unnatural that after what they have
     suffered from the hands of Colonial Government they should desire
     at least as nearly as much self-government as the Pondos enjoy.Certainly the present magisterial administration of the Transkei
     is very far from being a blessing, or conducive to peace.Nothing can possibly be worse than the present state of
     affairs in native administration, and the interests of the Colony
     demand a vertebrate government of some sort, whoever it may be
     composed of, instead of the invertebrate formation that is now
     called a government, and which drifts into and creates its own
     difficulties."_P.S._--Should Her Majesty's Government manage to arrange with
     Basutos in a satisfactory manner, 10,000 splendid cavalry could
     be counted on as allies in any contingencies in Natal, etc."The vital part of Gordon's Cape experiences was the Basuto mission,
and as it is desirable that it should not be obscured by other
matters, I will only touch briefly on his work as Commandant-General,
apart from that he performed as Adviser to the Cape Government in the
Basuto difficulty.The post of Commandant-General was forced upon him
in the first weeks of his arrival from the Mauritius by the combined
urgency of Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor, and Mr Merriman, then
Premier.Much against his inclination, Gordon agreed to fill the post
thus thrust upon him, but only for a time.It entailed an infinity of
work and worry.His instructions were to break up a red-tape system,
and such a task converted every place-holder into his enemy.Still
that opposition rather made his task attractive than otherwise, but in
a little time he found that this opposition would not stop short of
insubordination, and that to achieve success it would be necessary to
cashier a good many officers as a wholesome example.It was while
matters were in this preliminary stage that Mr Merriman's ministry
went out of office, and was succeeded by another under Mr Scanlan.The
measures which were favoured by the one were opposed by the other, and
Gordon soon saw that the desire for a thorough reorganisation of the
Cape forces, which, if properly supported, he could have carried out,
was no longer prevalent among the responsible Ministers.Still he drew
up an elaborate programme for the improvement of the Colonial Regular
forces, by which they might be increased in numbers and improved in
efficiency, at the same time that the annual expenditure was reduced.This document shows that mastery of detail which was one of his most
striking characteristics, and if his advice had been taken, the Cape
would have acquired nearly 4000 troops at no greater cost than it
already expended on 1600.In a second memorandum, he not only showed
the necessity existing for that larger force, but also how, by
administrative alterations in the Transkeian provinces, its cost might
be diminished and most conveniently discharged.Although I do not
quote these two documents, I cannot help saying that Gordon, in the
whole course of his life, never wrote anything more convincing than
the advice he gave the Cape Government, which, owing to local
jealousies and the invincible bulwark of vested interests, was never
carried into effect, although the Basuto question was subsequently
composed on Gordon's lines by the Imperial Government, and there has
been peace there during all the other South African troubles.The closing passages between Gordon and the Cape Ministers need only
be briefly referred to.Gordon resigned because he saw he could do no
good in Basutoland; the Cape Premier accepted his resignation because
Gordon "would not fight the Basutos."The intercommunications were
much more numerous, but that is their pith.Gordon came down to Cape
Town and sailed for England on 14th October, after having been five
and a half months in South Africa.He had been treated by the Cape
authorities without any regard for justice, and little for courtesy.The leading paper even admitted this much when it observed that "at
least General Gordon was entitled to the treatment of a gentleman."But the plain truth was that Gordon was summoned to South Africa and
employed by the Government, not as was ostentatiously proclaimed, and
as he himself believed, for the attainment of a just solution of the
Basuto difficulty, and for the execution of much-needed military
reforms, but in order that his military experience and genius might be
invoked for the purpose of overthrowing Masupha and of annexing
Basutoland, which two years of war and five millions of money had
failed to conquer.Hence their disappointment and resentment when
Gordon proclaimed that justice was on the side of Masupha; that under
no circumstances would he wage war with him; and that the whole origin
of the trouble lay in the bad policy, the incompetent magistrates, and
the insubordinate military officers of the Cape Government.The
indictment was a terrible one; it was also true in every line and
every particular.Having thus vindicated his own character, as well as the highest
principles of Government, Gordon left the Cape a poorer and a wiser
man than he was on his arrival.I have explained the personal loss he
incurred through the inadequacy of his pay and the cutting-off of his
army allowance.It has been stated that when he had taken his passage
for England he was without any money in his pocket, and that he
quaintly said to a friend: "Do you think it is right for a
Major-General of the British Army to set out on a journey like this
without sixpence in his pocket?"There is nothing improbable in such
an occurrence, and it was matched only sixteen months later, when he
was on the point of starting for Khartoum in the same impecunious
condition.Gordon arrived in England on 8th November, and after some
correspondence with the King of the Belgians, which will be referred
to later in connection with the Congo mission, he again left England
on 26th December.On this occasion he was going to carry out a
long-cherished desire to visit and reside in the Holy Land, so that he
might study on the spot the scenes with which his perfect knowledge of
the Bible--his inseparable companion--had made him in an extraordinary
degree familiar.In the best sense of the word, he was going to take a
holiday.There was to be absolute quiet and rest, and at the same time
a congenial occupation.He sailed for Jaffa as a guest on one of Sir
William Mackinnon's steamers, but he at once proceeded to Jerusalem,
where he lived alone, refusing to see any one, with his books as
companions, and "mystifying people as to what he was doing."During
his stay at Jerusalem he entered with much zest and at great length
into the questions of the various sites in the old Jewish capital.I
do not propose to follow the course of his labours in that pursuit, as
several works contain between them, I should say, every line he wrote
on the subject, and the general reader cannot be expected to take any
interest in abstruse and much-debated theological and topographical
questions.But even in the midst of these pursuits he did not lose his
quickness of military perception.After a brief inspection he at once
declared that the Russian Convent commanded the whole city, and was in
itself a strong fortress, capable of holding a formidable garrison,
which Russia could despatch in the guise of priests without any one
being the wiser.From Jerusalem, when the heat became great, he
returned to Jaffa, and his interest aroused in worldly matters by the
progress of events in Egypt, and the development of the Soudan danger,
which he had all along seen coming, was evoked by a project that was
brought under his notice for the construction across Palestine of a
canal to the head of the Gulf of Akabah.In a letter to myself he thus
dilates upon the scheme:--

     "Here is the subject which I am interested in if it could be
     done.The reasons are:--

     "1.We are in Egypt supporting an unpopular sovereign, whose
     tenure ends with departure of our troops.We offer no hope to the
     people of any solace by this support, and by the supporting of

     say, twelve to fifteen millions, and what a comfort to be free of

     late Sir William) Mackinnon of B.I.S.N.C., besides which H.M.You may say you had a letter from a
     correspondent."He wrote in a similar strain to other correspondents, but I have never
succeeded in discovering whether, from an engineering point of view,
the scheme was at all feasible.It seems to me that its suggestion is
somewhat destructive of Gordon's own declarations as to the superior
merits of the Cape route, nor does Sir Henry Gordon much strengthen
the case when, perceiving the inconsistency, he goes out of his way to
declare that Gordon only meant the Palestine canal to be a commercial
route.Any attempt to limit its usefulness could not destroy the
character claimed for it by its promoters, as an equally short and
more secure route than that by Suez.Yet it needs no gift of second
sight to predict that when any project of rivalry to the masterpiece
of Lesseps is carried out, it will be by rail to the Persian Gulf,
whether the starting-point be the Bosphorus or the Levant.In the midst of his interesting researches near Mount Carmel, a
summons from the outer world reached Gordon in the form of a letter
from Sir William Mackinnon, telling him that the King of the Belgians
now called on him to fulfil a promise he had made some years before.When Gordon first returned from the Cape the King of the Belgians
wrote, reminding him of his old promise, dating from 1880, to enter
into his service on the Congo, and stating that the difficulty of
having an internationally recognised Congo flag, which Gordon had made
a _sine qua non_ of his appointment, could be most speedily solved by
Gordon joining him as counsellor at once.This Gordon could not agree
to, and he went to Palestine, there to await the King's summons,
which came by Sir William Mackinnon's note in October 1883.It then
became necessary for Gordon to obtain the official permission of his
Government to take up this post, of the exact nature of which the
Foreign Office had been already informed, both by General Gordon and
King Leopold.Gordon at once telegraphed to the War Office for the leave rendered
necessary by his being on the active list, and that Department
replied, asking for particulars.When these were furnished through the
Foreign Office the decision was announced that "the Secretary of State
declines to sanction your employment on the Congo."The telegraph
clerk, more discerning or considerate than Her Majesty's Government,
altered "declines" into "decides," and Gordon, in happy ignorance of
the truth, proceeded with all possible despatch _via_ Acre and Genoa
to Brussels, which he reached on New Year's Day, 1884.That very night
he wrote me a short note saying, "I go (_D.V._) next month to the
Congo, but keep it secret."Such things cannot be kept secret, and
four days later a leading article in _The Times_ informed his
countrymen of Gordon's new mission.On reaching Brussels the mistake in the telegram was discovered, and
Gordon here learnt that his Congo mission was vetoed.Then came the
difficulty to know what was to be done.Without leave he could not go
anywhere without resigning his commission; he was not qualified for a
pension, and there were engagements he had voluntarily contracted that
he would not see broken, and persons who would suffer by his death,
whose interests he was in every way bound to safeguard.Therefore, if
he was to carry out his engagement with the King of the Belgians, it
was obviously necessary that he should resign the British Army, and
that the King should compensate him for his loss.The King said at
once: "Retire from the army and I will compensate you," but in a
matter of such importance to others Gordon felt nothing should be left
to chance, and that a definite contract should be made.For this he
had neither the patience nor the business knowledge, and he delegated
the task of arranging the matter to his brother, Sir Henry Gordon, who
negotiated with the late Sir William Mackinnon as representing the
King.They agreed that the value of Gordon's pension if commuted would
be L7288, and the King of the Belgians was to provide that sum, which
was to be paid into a trust fund.In this and every other matter the
King behaved towards Gordon in the most generous and cordial manner,
furnishing a marked contrast with the grudging and parsimonious spirit
of the British Government towards Gordon in China, at the Cape, and
now again when destined for the Congo.All the arrangements connected with this subject were made in three
days, and while Gordon gave instructions for his will to be prepared
for the disposal of the trust fund after his death, he wrote the same
day (6th January) to Mr H. M. Stanley, then acting for the King on the
Congo, announcing his own appointment, offering to "serve willingly
with or under him," and fixing his own departure from Lisbon for 5th
of February._Dis aliter visum._ For the moment he worked up some
enthusiasm in his task."We will kill the slave-traders in their
haunts"; and again, "No such efficacious means of cutting at root of
slave trade ever was presented as that which God has, I trust, opened
out to us through the kind disinterestedness of His Majesty," are
passages in the same letter, yet all the time there is no doubt his
heart and his thoughts were elsewhere.They were in the Soudan, not on
the Congo.The night of this letter he crossed from Brussels, and went straight
to his sister's house, long the residence, and, practically speaking,
the home of his family, 5 Rockstone Place, Southampton.On the 7th of
the month--that is, the same day as he arrived--he wrote the formal
letter requesting leave to resign his commission in the Queen's army,
and also stating, with his usual candour, that King Leopold II.had
guaranteed him against any pecuniary loss.To that letter it may at
once be stated that no reply was ever sent.Even the least sympathetic
official could not feel altogether callous to a voluntary proposition
to remove the name of "Chinese" Gordon from the British army list, and
the sudden awakening of the public to the extraordinary claims of
General Gordon on national gratitude, and his special fitness to deal
with the Soudan difficulty warned the authorities that a too rigid
application of office rules would not in his case be allowed.By no
individual effort, as has been too lightly granted by some writers,
but by the voice of the British people was it decided that not only
should Gordon have leave to go to the Congo, without resigning his
commission, but also that he should be held entitled to draw his pay
as a British general while thus employed.But this was not the whole
truth, although I have no doubt that the arrangement would have been
carried out in any case.In their dilemma the Government saw a chance
of extrication in the person of Gordon, the one man recognised by the
public and the press as capable of coping with a difficulty which
seemed too much for them.The whole truth, therefore, was that the
Congo mission was to wait until after Gordon had been sent to, and
returned from, the Soudan.He was then to be placed by the British
Government entirely at the disposal of the King of the Belgians.As
this new arrangement turned on the assent of the King, it was vital to
keep it secret during the remainder of the 15th and the whole of the
16th of that eventful January.When Gordon arrived at Waterloo Station, at a little before two
o'clock on 15th January, and was met there by myself, I do not think
that he knew definitely what was coming, but he was a man of
extraordinary shrewdness, and although essentially unworldly, could
see as clearly and as far through a transaction as the keenest man of
business.What he did know was that the army authorities were going to
treat him well, but his one topic of conversation the whole way to
Pall Mall was not the Congo but the Soudan.To the direct question
whether he was not really going, as I suspected, to the Nile instead
of the Congo, he declared he had no information that would warrant
such an idea, but still, if the King of the Belgians would grant the
permission, he would certainly not be disinclined to go there first.I
have no doubt that those who acted in the name of the Ministry in a
few minutes discovered the true state of his mind, and that Gordon
then and there agreed, on the express request of the Government of Mr
Gladstone, to go and see the King, and beg him to suspend the
execution of his promise until he had gone to the Soudan to arrest the
Mahdi's career, or to relieve the Egyptian garrisons, if the phrase be
preferred.It should also be stated that Gordon's arrangement with the
King of the Belgians was always coupled with this proviso, "provided
the Government of my own country does not require my services."The
generosity of that sovereign in the matter of the compensation for his
Commission did not render that condition void, and however irritating
the King may have found the circumstances, Gordon broke neither the
spirit nor the letter of his engagement with his Majesty by obeying
the orders of his own Government.Late the same evening I was present at his brother's house to receive
an account for publication of his plans on the Congo, but surrounded
by so large a number of his relatives summoned to see their hero, many
of them for the last time, it was neither convenient nor possible to
carry out this task, which was accordingly postponed till the
following morning, when I was to see him at the Charing Cross Hotel,
and accompany him by the early boat train to Dover.On that night his
last will was signed and witnessed by his uncle, Mr George Enderby,
and myself.The next morning I was at the hotel before seven, but
instead of travelling by this early train, he postponed his departure
till ten o'clock, and the greater part of those three hours were given
to an explanation, map in hand, of his plans on the Congo.The
article, based on his information, appeared in _The Times_ of 17th
January 1884, but several times during our conversation he exclaimed,
"There may be a respite," but he refused to be more definite.Thus he
set out for Brussels, whether he was accompanied by his friend
Captain (now Colonel) F. Brocklehurst, who was undoubtedly acting as
the representative of the authorities.I believe I may say with
confidence that if he did not actually see the King of the Belgians on
the evening of the same day, some communication passed indirectly,
which showed the object of his errand, for although his own letter
communicating the event is dated 17th, from Brussels, it is a fact
within my own knowledge that late in the evening of the 16th a
telegram was received--"Gordon goes to the Soudan."The first intimation of something having happened that his brother Sir
Henry Gordon received, was in a hurried letter, dated 17th January,
which arrived by the early post on Friday, 18th, asking him to "get
his uniform ready and some patent leather boots," but adding, "I saw
King Leopold to-day; he is furious."Even then Sir Henry, although he
guessed his destination, did not know that his departure would be so
sudden, for Gordon crossed the same night, and was kept at
Knightsbridge Barracks in a sort of honourable custody by Captain
Brocklehurst, so that the new scheme might not be prematurely
revealed.Sir Henry, a busy man, went about his own work, having seen
to his brother's commission, and it was not until his return at five
o'clock that he learnt all, and that Gordon was close at hand.He at
once hurried off to see him, and on meeting, Gordon, in a high state
of exhilaration, exclaimed, "I am off to the Soudan."and back came the reply, "To-night!"To him at that moment it meant congenial work and the chance of
carrying out the thoughts that had been surging through his mind ever
since Egyptian affairs became troubled and the Mahdi's power rose on
the horizon of the Soudan.He
was to learn in his own person the weakness and falseness of his
Government, and to find himself betrayed by the very persons who had
only sought his assistance in the belief that by a miracle--and
nothing less would have sufficed--he might relieve them from
responsibilities to which they were not equal.Far better would it
have been, not only for Gordon's sake, but even for the reputation of
England, if he had carried out his original project on the Congo,
where, on a less conspicuous scene than the Nile, he might still have
fought and won the battle of humanity.I am placed in a position to state that on the morning of the 17th, at
10 A.M., he wrote to his sister from Brussels, as follows--"Do not
mention it, but there is just a chance I may have to go to Soudan for
two months, and then go to Congo," and again in a second letter at two
o'clock, "Just got a telegram from Wolseley saying, 'Come back to
London by evening train,' so when you get this I shall be in town,
_but keep it a dead secret_, for I hope to leave it again the same
evening.I will not take Governor-Generalship again, I will only
report on situation."After this came a post-card--18th January, 6
A.M."Left B., am now in London; I hope to go back again to-night."That he was not detained the whole day in the Barracks is shown in the
following letter, now published for the first time, which gives the
only account of his interview with the members of the Government that
sent him out:--

                                                       "19."MY DEAR AUGUSTA,--I arrived in town very tired, at 6 A.M.yesterday, went with Brocklehurst to Barracks, washed, and went
     to Wolseley.He said Ministers would see me at 3 P.M.I went back
     to Barracks and reposed.I
     went with him and saw Granville, Hartington, Dilke, and
     Northbrook.They said, 'Had I seen Wolseley, and did I understand
     their ideas?'I said 'Yes,' and repeated what Wolseley had said
     to me as to their ideas, which was '_they would evacuate
     Soudan_.'They were pleased, and said 'That was their idea; would
     I go?'I said 'To-night,' and it
     was over.The Duke of Cambridge and
     Lord Wolseley came to see me off.I saw Henry and Bob (R. F.
     Gordon); no one else except Stokes--all very kind.I have taken
     Stewart with me, a nice fellow.We are now in train near Mont
     Cenis.I am not moved a bit, and hope to do the people good.Lord
     Granville said Ministers were very much obliged to me.I said I
     was much honoured by going.I telegraphed King of the Belgians at
     once, and told him 'Wait a few months.'Kindest love to
     all.--Your affectionate brother,

                                             "C. G.As further evidence of the haste of his departure, I should like to
mention that he had hardly any clothes with him, and that Mrs Watson,
wife of his friend Colonel Watson, procured him all he required--in
fact, fitted him out--during the two days he stayed at Cairo.These
kindly efforts on his behalf were thrown away, for all his
baggage--clothes, uniforms, orders, etc.--was captured with the money
at Berber and never reached him.His only insignia of office at
Khartoum was the Fez, and the writer who described him as putting on
his uniform when the Mahdists broke into the town was gifted with more
imagination than love of truth.When Gordon left Egypt, at the end of the year 1879, he was able to
truthfully declare in the words of his favourite book: "No man could
lift his hand or his foot in the land of the Soudan without me."Yet
he was fully alive to the dangers of the future, although then they
were no more than a little cloud on the horizon, for he wrote in 1878:
"Our English Government lives on a hand-to-mouth policy.They are very
ignorant of these lands, yet some day or other, they or some other
Government, will have to know them, for things at Cairo cannot stay as
they are.The Khedive will be curbed in, and will no longer be
absolute Sovereign.Then will come the question of these countries....
There is no doubt that if the Governments of France and England do not
pay more attention to the Soudan--if they do not establish at Khartoum
a branch of the mixed tribunals, and see that justice is done--the
disruption of the Soudan from Cairo is only a question of time.This
disruption, moreover, will not end the troubles, for the Soudanese
through their allies in Lower Egypt--the black soldiers I mean--will
carry on their efforts in Cairo itself.Now these black soldiers are
the only troops in the Egyptian service that are worth anything."The
gift of prophecy could scarcely have been demonstrated in a more
remarkable degree, yet the Egyptian Government and everybody else went
on acting as if there was no danger in the Soudan, and treated it like
a thoroughly conquered province inhabited by a satisfied, or at least
a thoroughly subjected population.From this dream there was to be a
rude and startling awakening.It is impossible to say whether there was any connection direct or
indirect between the revolt of Arabi Pasha and the military leaders at
Cairo and the rebellion in the Soudan, which began under the auspices
of the so-called Mahdi.At the very least it may be asserted that the
spectacle of successful insubordination in the Delta--for it was
completely successful, and would have continued so but for the
intervention of British arms--was calculated to encourage those who
entertained a desire to upset the Khedive's authority in the upper
regions of the Nile.That Gordon held that the authors of the Arabi
rising and of the Mahdist movement were the same in sympathy, if not
in person, cannot be doubted, and in February 1882, when the Mahdi had
scarcely begun his career, he wrote: "If they send the Black regiment
to the Soudan to quell the revolt, they will inoculate all the troops
up there, and the Soudan will revolt against Cairo, whom they all
hate."It will be noted that that letter was written more than twenty
months before the destruction of the Hicks Expedition made the Mahdi
master of the Soudan.It was in the year 1880 that the movements of a Mahommedan dervish,
named Mahomed Ahmed, first began to attract the attention of the
Egyptian officials.He had quarrelled with and repudiated the
authority of the head of his religious order, because he tolerated
such frivolous practices as dancing and singing.His boldness in this
matter, and his originality in others, showed that he was pursuing a
course of his own, and to provide for his personal security, as well
as for convenience in keeping up his communications with Khartoum and
other places, he fixed his residence on an islet in the White Nile
near Kawa.Mahomed Ahmed was a native of the lower province of
Dongola, and as such was looked upon with a certain amount of contempt
by the other races of the Soudan.When he quarrelled with his
religious leader he was given the opprobrious name of "a wretched
Dongolawi," but the courage with which he defied and exposed an
arch-priest for not rigidly abiding by the tenets of the Koran,
redounded so much to his credit that the people began to talk of this
wonderful dervish quite as much as of the Khedive's Governor-General.Many earnest and energetic Mahommedans flocked to him, and among these
was the present Khalifa Abdullah, whose life had been spared by
Zebehr, and who in return had wished to proclaim that leader of the
slave-hunters Mahdi.To his instigation was probably due not merely
the assumption of that title by Mahomed Ahmed, but the addition of a
worldly policy to what was to have been a strictly religious
propaganda.Little as he deemed there was to fear from this ascetic, the Egyptian
Governor-General Raouf, Gordon's successor, and stigmatised by him as
the Tyrant of Harrar, became curious about him, and sent someone to
interview and report upon this new religious teacher.The report
brought back was that he was "a madman," and it was at once considered
safe to treat him with indifference.Such was the position in the year
1880, and the official view was only modified a year later by the
receipt of information that the gathering on the island of Abba had
considerably increased, and that Mahomed Ahmed was attended by an
armed escort, who stood in his presence with drawn swords.It was at
this time too that he began to declare that he had a divine mission,
and took unto himself the style of Mahdi--the long-expected messenger
who was to raise up Islam--at first secretly among his chosen friends,
but not so secretly that news of his bold step did not reach the ears
of Raouf.The assumption of such a title, which placed its holder
above and beyond the reach of such ordinary commands as are conveyed
in the edicts of a Khedive or a Sultan, convinced Raouf that the time
had come to put an end to these pretensions.That conviction was not
diminished when Mahomed Ahmed made a tour through Kordofan, spreading
a knowledge of his name and intentions, and undoubtedly winning over
many adherents to his cause.On his return to Abba he found a summons
from the Governor-General to come to Khartoum.That summons was
followed by the arrival of a steamer, the captain of which had orders
to capture the False Mahdi alive or dead.Mahomed Ahmed received warning from his friends and sympathisers that
if he went to Khartoum he might consider himself a dead man.He
probably never had the least intention of going there, and what he had
seen of the state of feeling in the Soudan, where the authority of the
Khedive was neither popular nor firmly established, rendered him more
inclined to defy the Egyptians.When the delegate of Raouf Pasha
therefore appeared before him, Mahomed Ahmed was surrounded by such an
armed force as precluded the possibility of a violent seizure of his
person, and when he resorted to argument to induce him to come to
Khartoum, Mahomed Ahmed, throwing off the mask, and standing forth in
the self-imposed character of Mahdi, exclaimed: "By the grace of God
and His Prophet I am the master of this country, and never shall I go
to Khartoum to justify myself."After this picturesque defiance it only remained for him and the
Egyptians to prove which was the stronger.It must be admitted that Raouf at once recognised the gravity of the
affair, and without delay he sent a small force on Gordon's old
steamer, the _Ismailia_, to bring Mahomed Ahmed to reason.By its numbers and the superior armament of the troops
this expedition should have proved a complete success, and a competent
commander would have strangled the Mahdist phenomenon at its birth.Unfortunately the Egyptian officers were grossly incompetent, and
divided among themselves.They attempted a night attack, and as they
were quite ignorant of the locality, it is not surprising that they
fell into the very trap they thought to set for their opponents.In the confusion the divided Egyptian forces fired upon each other,
and the Mahdists with their swords and short stabbing spears completed
the rest.Of two whole companies of troops only a handful escaped by
swimming to the steamer, which returned to Khartoum with the news of
this defeat.Even this reverse was very far from ensuring the triumph
of Mahomed Ahmed, or the downfall of the Egyptian power; and, indeed,
the possession of steamers and the consequent command of the Nile
navigation rendered it extremely doubtful whether he could long hold
his own on the island of Abba.He thought so himself, and, gathering
his forces together, marched to the western districts of Kordofan,
where, at Jebel Gedir, he established his headquarters.A special
reason made him select that place, for it is believed by Mahommedans
that the Mahdi will first appear at Jebel Masa in North Africa, and
Mahomed Ahmed had no scruple in declaring that the two places were the
same.To complete the resemblance he changed with autocratic pleasure
the name Jebel Gedir into Jebel Masa.During this march several attempts were made to capture him by the
local garrisons, but they were all undertaken in such a half-hearted
manner, and so badly carried out, that the Mahdi was never in any
danger, and his reputation was raised by the failure of the
Government.Once established at Jebel Gedir the Mahdi began to organise his forces
on a larger scale, and to formulate a policy that would be likely to
bring all the tribes of the Soudan to his side.While thus employed
Rashed Bey, Governor of Fashoda, resolved to attack him.Rashed is
entitled to the credit of seeing that the time demanded a signal, and
if possible, a decisive blow, but he is to be censured for the
carelessness and over-confidence he displayed in carrying out his
scheme.Although he had a strong force he should have known that the
Mahdi's followers were now numbered by the thousand, and that he was
an active and enterprising foe.But he neglected the most simple
precautions, and showed that he had no military skill.The Mahdi fell
upon him during his march, killed him, his chief officers, and 1400
men, and the small body that escaped bore testimony to the formidable
character of the victor's fighting power.This battle was fought on
9th December 1881, and the end of that year therefore beheld the firm
establishment of the Mahdi's power in a considerable part of the
Soudan; but even then the superiority of the Egyptian resources was so
marked and incontestable that, properly handled, they should have
sufficed to speedily overwhelm him.At this juncture Raouf was succeeded as Governor-General by
Abd-el-Kader Pasha, who had held the same post before Gordon, and who
had gained something of a reputation from the conquest of Darfour, in
conjunction with Zebehr.At least he ought to have known the Soudan,
but the dangers which had been clear to the eye of Gordon were
concealed from him and his colleagues.Still, the first task
he set himself--and indeed it was the justification of his
re-appointment--was to retrieve the disaster to Rashed, and to destroy
the Mahdi's power.He therefore collected a force of not less than
4000 men, chiefly trained infantry, and he entrusted the command to
Yusuf Pasha, a brave officer, who had distinguished himself under
Gessi in the war with Suleiman.This force left Khartoum in March
1882, but it did not begin its inland march from the Nile until the
end of May, when it had been increased by at least 2000 irregular
levies raised in Kordofan.Unfortunately, Yusuf was just as
over-confident as Rashed had been.He neglected all precautions, and
derided the counsel of those who warned him that the Mahdi's followers
might prove a match for his well-armed and well-drilled troops.After
a ten days' march he reached the neighbourhood of the Mahdi's
position, and he was already counting on a great victory, when, at
dawn of day on 7th June, he was himself surprised by his opponent in a
camp that he had ostentatiously refused to fortify in the smallest
degree.Some of the local
irregulars escaped, but of the regular troops and their commanders not
one.This decisive victory not merely confirmed the reputation of the
Mahdi, and made most people in the Soudan believe that he was really a
heaven-sent champion, but it also exposed the inferiority of the
Government troops and the Khedive's commanders.The defeat of Yusuf may be said to have been decisive so far as the
active forces of the Khedive in the field were concerned, but the
towns held out, and El Obeid, the capital of Kordofan, in particular
defied all the Mahdi's efforts to take it.The possession of this and
other strong places furnished the supporters of the Government with a
reasonable hope that on the arrival of fresh troops the ground lost
might be recovered, and an end put to what threatened to become a
formidable rebellion.Unfortunately, it was one that the Mahdi turned to the best advantage
by drilling and arming his troops, and summoning levies from the more
distant parts of the provinces, while the Khedive's Government,
engrossed in troubles nearer home--the Arabi revolt and the
intervention of England in the internal administration--seemed
paralysed in its efforts to restore its authority over the Soudan,
which at that moment would have been comparatively easy.The only
direct result of Yusuf's defeat in June 1882 was that two of the Black
regiments were sent up to Khartoum, and as their allegiance to the
Government was already shaken, their presence, as Gordon apprehended,
was calculated to aggravate rather than to improve the situation.Matters remained very much in this state until the Mahdi's capture of
the important town of El Obeid.Notwithstanding the presence within
the walls of an element favourable to the Mahdi, the Commandant, Said
Pasha, made a valiant and protracted defence.He successfully repelled
all the Mahdi's attempts to take the place by storm, but he had to
succumb to famine after all the privations of a five months' siege.If
there had been other men like Said Pasha, especially at Khartoum, the
power of the Mahdi would never have risen to the height it attained.The capture of an important place like El Obeid did more for the
spread of the Mahdi's reputation and power than the several victories
he had gained in the field.This important event took place in January
1883.Abd-el-Kader was then removed from the Governor-Generalship, and
a successor found in Alla-ed-din, a man of supposed energy and
resource.More than that, an English officer--Colonel Hicks--was given
the military command, and it was decided to despatch an expedition of
sufficient strength, as it was thought, to crush the Mahdi at one
blow.The preparations for this fresh advance against the Mahdi were made
with care, and on an extensive scale.Several regiments were sent from
Egypt, and in the spring of the year a permanent camp was established
for their accommodation at Omdurman, on the western bank of the Nile,
opposite Khartoum.Here, by the end of June 1883, was assembled a
force officially computed to number 7000 infantry, 120 cuirassiers,
300 irregular cavalry, and not fewer than 30 pieces of artillery,
including rockets and mortars.Colonel Hicks was given the nominal
command, several English and other European officers were appointed
to serve under him, and the Khedive specially ordered the
Governor-General to accompany the expedition that was to put an end to
the Mahdi's triumph.Such was the interest, and, it may be added,
confidence, felt in the expedition, that two special correspondents,
one of whom was Edmond O'Donovan, who had made himself famous a few
years earlier by reaching the Turcoman stronghold of Merv, were
ordered to accompany it, and report its achievements.The Mahdi learnt in good time of the extensive preparations being made
for this expedition, but he was not dismayed, because all the fighting
tribes of Kordofan, Bahr Gazelle, and Darfour were now at his back,
and he knew that he could count on the devotion of 100,000 fanatical
warriors.Still, he and his henchman Abdullah, who supplied the
military brains to the cause, were not disposed to throw away a
chance, and the threatening appearance of the Egyptian military
preparations led them to conceive the really brilliant idea of
stirring up trouble in the rear of Khartoum.For this purpose a man
of extraordinary energy and influence was ready to their hand in Osman
Digma, a slave-dealer of Souakim, who might truly be called the Zebehr
of the Eastern Soudan.This man hastened to Souakim as the delegate of
the Mahdi, from whom he brought special proclamations, calling on the
tribes to rise for a Holy War.Although this move subsequently
aggravated the Egyptian position and extended the military triumphs of
the Mahdi, it did not attain the immediate object for which it was
conceived, as the Hicks Expedition set out on its ill-omened march
before Osman had struck a blow.The power of the Mahdi was at this moment so firmly established, and
his reputation based on the double claim of a divine mission and
military success so high that it may be doubted whether the 10,000
men, of which the Hicks force consisted when the irregulars raised by
the Governor-General had joined it at Duem, would have sufficed to
overcome him even if they had been ably led, and escaped all the
untoward circumstances that first retarded their progress and then
sealed their fate.The plan of campaign was based on a misconception
of the Mahdi's power, and was carried out with utter disregard of
prudence and of the local difficulties to be encountered between the
Nile and El Obeid.But the radical fault of the whole enterprise was a
strategical one.The situation made it prudent and even necessary for
the Government to stand on the defensive, and to abstain from military
expeditions, while the course pursued was to undertake offensive
measures in the manner most calculated to favour the chances of the
Mahdi, and to attack him at the very point where his superiority could
be most certainly shown.But quite apart from any original error as to the inception of the
campaign, which may fairly be deemed a matter of opinion, there can be
no difference between any two persons who have studied the facts that
the execution of it was completely mismanaged.In the first place the
start of the expedition was delayed, so that the Mahdi got ample
warning of the coming attack.The troops were all in the camp at
Omdurman in June, but they did not reach Duem till September, and a
further delay of two months occurred there before they began their
march towards El Obeid.That interval was chiefly taken up with
disputes between Hicks and his Egyptian colleagues, and it is even
believed that there was much friction between Hicks and his European
lieutenants.The first radical error committed was the decision to advance on El
Obeid from Duem, because there were no wells on that route, whereas
had the northern route _via_ Gebra and Bara been taken, a certain
supply of water could have been counted on, and still more important,
the co-operation of the powerful Kabbabish tribe, the only one still
hostile to the Mahdi, might have been secured.The second important
error was not less fatal.When the force marched it was accompanied by
6000 camels and a large number of women.Encumbered in its movements
by these useless impedimenta, the force never had any prospect of
success with its active enemy.As it slowly advanced from the Nile it
became with each day's march more hopelessly involved in its own
difficulties, and the astute Mahdi expressly forbade any premature
attack to be made upon an army which he clearly saw was marching to
its doom.On the 1st November 1883, when the Egyptians were already disheartened
by the want of water, the non-arrival of reinforcements from the
garrisons near the Equator, which the Governor-General had rashly
promised to bring up, and the exhausting nature of their march through
a difficult country, the Mahdi's forces began their attack.Concealed
in the high grass, they were able to pour in a heavy fire on the
conspicuous body of the Egyptians at short range without exposing
themselves.But notwithstanding his heavy losses, Hicks pressed on,
because he knew that his only chance of safety lay in getting out of
the dense cover in which he was at such a hopeless disadvantage.But
this the Mahdi would never permit, and on 4th November, when Hicks had
reached a place called Shekan, he gave the order to his impatient
followers to go in and finish the work they had so well begun.The
Egyptian soldiers seem to have been butchered without resistance.The
Europeans and the Turkish cavalry fought well for a short time, but in
a few minutes they were overpowered by superior numbers.Of the whole
force of 10,000 men, only a few individuals escaped by some special
stroke of fortune, for nearly the whole of the 300 prisoners taken
were subsequently executed.Such was the complete and appalling
character of the destruction of Hicks's army, which seemed to shatter
at a single blow the whole fabric of the Khedive's power in the
Soudan, and rivetted the attention of Europe on that particular
quarter of the Dark Continent.The consequences of that decisive success, which became known in
London three weeks after it happened, were immediate throughout the
region wherein it occurred.Many Egyptian garrisons, which had been
holding out in the hope of succour through the force that Hicks Pasha
was bringing from Khartoum, abandoned hope after its destruction at
Shekan, and thought only of coming to terms with the conqueror.Among
these was the force at Dara in Darfour under the command of Slatin
Pasha.That able officer had held the place for months under the
greatest difficulty, and had even obtained some slight successes in
the field, but the fate of the Hicks expedition convinced him that the
situation was hopeless, and that his duty to the brave troops under
him required the acceptance of the honourable terms which his tact and
reputation enabled him to secure at the hands of the conqueror.Slatin
surrendered on 23rd December 1883; Lupton Bey, commander in the Bahr
Gazelle, about the same time, and these successes were enhanced and
extended by those achieved by Osman Digma in the Eastern Soudan,
where, early in February 1884, while Gordon was on his way to
Khartoum, that leader inflicted on Baker Pasha at Tokar a defeat
scarcely less crushing than that of Shekan.By New Year's Day, 1884, therefore, the power of the Mahdi was
triumphantly established over the whole extent of the Soudan, from the
Equator to Souakim, with the exception of Khartoum and the middle
course of the Nile from that place to Dongola.There were also some
outlying garrisons, such as that at Kassala, but the principal
Egyptian force remaining was the body of 4000 so-called troops, the
less efficient part, we may be sure, of those available, left behind
at Khartoum, under Colonel de Coetlogon, by Hicks Pasha, when he set
out on his unfortunate expedition.If the power of the Mahdi at this
moment were merely to be measured by comparison with the collapse of
authority, courage, and confidence of the titular upholders of the
Khedive's Government, it might be pronounced formidable.It had
sufficed to defeat every hostile effort made against it, and to
practically annihilate all the armies that Egypt could bring into the
field.Its extraordinary success was no doubt due to the incompetency,
over-confidence, and deficient military spirit and knowledge of the
Khedive's commanders and troops.But, while making the fullest
admission on these points, it cannot be disputed that some of the
elements in the Mahdi's power would have made it formidable, even if
the cause of the Government had been more worthily and efficiently
sustained.There is no doubt that, in the first place, he appealed to
races which thought they were overtaxed, and to classes whose only
tangible property had been assailed and diminished by the Anti-Slavery
policy of the Government.Even if it would be going too far to say
that Mahomed Ahmed, the long-looked-for Mahdi, was only a tool in the
hands of secret conspirators pledged to avenge Suleiman, to restore
Zebehr, and to bring back the good old times, when a fortune lay in
the easy acquisition of human ivory, there is no doubt that the
backbone of his power was provided by those followers of Suleiman,
whom Gordon had broken up at Shaka and driven from Dara.But the
Mahdi had supplied them in religious fanaticism with a more powerful
incentive than pecuniary gain, and when he showed them how easily they
might triumph over their opponents, he inspired them with a confidence
which has not yet lost its efficacy.In 1884 all these inducements for the tribes of the Soudan to believe
in their religious leader were in their pristine strength.He had
succeeded in every thing he undertook, he had armed his countless
warriors with the weapons taken from the armies he had destroyed, and
he had placed at the disposal of his supporters an immense and
easily-acquired spoil.The later experiences of the Mahdists were to
be neither so pleasant nor so profitable, but at the end of 1883 they
were at the height of their confidence and power.It was at such a
moment and against such a powerful adversary that the British
Government thought it right to take advantage of the devotion and
gallantry of a single man, to send him alone to grapple with a
difficulty which several armies had, by their own failure and
destruction, rendered more grave, at the same time that they
established the formidable nature of the rebellion in the Soudan as an
unimpeachable fact instead of a disputable opinion.I do not think his
own countrymen have yet quite appreciated the extraordinary heroism
and devotion to his country which Gordon showed when he rushed off
single-handed to oppose the ever-victorious Mahdi at the very zenith
of his power.In unrolling the scroll of events connected with an intricate history,
it next becomes necessary to explain why Gordon voluntarily, and it
may even be admitted, enthusiastically, undertook a mission that, to
any man in his senses, must have seemed at the moment at which it was
undertaken little short of insanity.Whatever else may be said against
the Government and the military authorities who suggested his going,
and availed themselves of his readiness to go, to Khartoum, I do not
think there is the shadow of a justification for the allegation that
they forced him to proceed on that romantic errand, although of course
it is equally clear that he insisted as the condition of his going at
all that he should be ordered by his Government to proceed on this
mission.Beyond this vital principle, which he held to all his life in
never volunteering, he was far too eager to go himself to require any
real stirring-up or compulsion.It was even a secret and unexpressed
grievance that he should not be called upon to hasten to the spot,
which had always been in his thoughts since the time he had left it.He could think of nothing else; in the midst of other work he would
turn aside to discuss the affairs of Egypt and the Soudan as paramount
to every other consideration; and when a great mission, like that to
the Congo, which he could have made a turning-point in African
history, was placed in his hands, he could only ask for "a respite,"
and, with the charm of the Sphinx strong upon him, rushed on his fate
in a chivalrous determination to essay the impossible.But was it
right or justifiable that wise politicians and experienced generals
should take advantage of such enthusiasm and self-sacrifice, and let
one man go unaided to achieve what thousands had failed to do?It is necessary to establish clearly in the first place, and beyond
dispute, the frame of mind which induced Gordon to take up his last
Nile mission in precisely the confiding manner that he did.Gordon
left Egypt at the end of 1879.Although events there in 1880 were of
interest and importance, Gordon was too much occupied in India and
China to say anything, but in October 1881 he drew up an important
memorandum on affairs in Egypt since the deposition of Ismail.Gordon
gave it to me specially for publication, and it duly appeared in _The
Times_, but its historical interest is that it shows how Gordon's
thoughts were still running on the affairs of the country in which he
had served so long.The following is the full text:--

     "On the 16th of August 1879, the Firman installing Tewfik as
     Khedive was published in Cairo.From the 26th of June 1879, when
     Ismail was deposed, to this date, Cherif Pasha remained Prime
     Minister; he had been appointed on the dismissal of the
     Rivers-Wilson and de Blignieres Ministry in May.Between June and
     August Cherif had been working with the view of securing to the
     country a representative form of government, and had only a short
     time before August 16 laid his proposition before Tewfik.Cherif's idea was that, the representation being in the hands of
     the people, there would be more chance of Egypt maintaining her
     independence than if the Government was a personal one.It will
     be remembered that, though many states have repudiated their
     debts, no other ruler of those states was considered responsible
     except in the case of Ismail of Egypt.Europe considered Ismail
     responsible personally.She did not consider the rulers of
     Turkey, Greece, Spain, etc., responsible, so that Cherif was
     quite justified in his proposition.Cherif has been unjustly
     considered opposed to any reform.Certainly he
     had shown his independence in refusing to acknowledge
     Rivers-Wilson as his superior, preferring to give up his position
     to doing so, but he knew well that reform was necessary, and had
     always advised it.Cherif is perhaps the only Egyptian Minister
     whose character for strict integrity is unimpeachable."A thoroughly independent man, caring but little for office or
     its emoluments, of a good family, with antecedents which would
     bear any investigation, he was not inclined to be questioned by
     men whose social position was inferior to his own, and whose
     _parti pris_ was against him.In the Council Chamber he was in a
     minority because he spoke his mind; but this was not so with
     other Ministers, whose antecedents were dubious.Had his advice
     been taken, Ismail would have now been Khedive of Egypt.Any one
     who knows Cherif will agree to this account of him, and will rate
     him as infinitely superior to his other colleagues.He is
     essentially not an intriguer."To return, immediately after the promulgation of the Firman on
     August 16, Tewfik dismisses suddenly Cherif, and the European
     Press considers he has done a bold thing, and, misjudging Cherif,
     praise him for having broken with the advisers who caused the
     ruin of Ismail.My opinion is that Tewfik feared Cherif's
     proposition as being likely to curtail his power as absolute
     ruler, and that he judged that he would by this dismissal gain
     _kudos_ in Europe, and protect his absolute power."After a time Riaz is appointed in Cherif's place, and then
     Tewfik begins his career.He concedes this and that to European
     desires, but in so doing claims for his youth and inexperience
     exemption from any reform which would take from his absolute
     power.Knowing that it was the bondholders who upset his father
     he conciliates them; they in their turn leave him to act as he
     wished with regard to the internal government of the country.Riaz was so placed as to be between two influences--one, the
     bondholders seeking their advantages; the other, Tewfik, seeking
     to retain all power.Knowing better than
     Tewfik the feeling of Europe, he inclines more to the bondholders
     than to Tewfik, to whom, however, he is bound to give some sops,
     such as the Universal Military Service Bill, which the
     bondholders let pass without a word, and which is the root of the
     present troubles.After a time Tewfik finds that Riaz will give
     no more sops, for the simple reason he dares not.Then Tewfik
     finds him _de trop_, and by working up the military element
     endeavours to counterbalance him.The European Powers manage to
     keep the peace for a time, but eventually the military become too
     strong for even Tewfik, who had conjured them up, and taking
     things into their own hands upset Riaz, which Tewfik is glad of,
     and demand a Constitution, which Tewfik is not glad of.Cherif
     then returns, and it is to be hoped will get for the people what
     he demanded before his dismissal."It is against all reason to expect any straightforward dealings
     in any Sultan, Khedive, or Ameer; the only hope is in the people
     they govern, and the raising of the people should be our object."There is no real loyalty towards the descendants of the Sandjak
     of Salonica in Egypt; the people are Arabs, they are Greeks.The
     people care for themselves.It is reiterated over and over again
     that Egypt is prosperous and contented.I do not think it has
     altered at all, except in improving its finances for the benefit
     of the bondholders.The army may be paid regularly, but the lot
     of the fellaheen and inhabitants of the Soudan is the same
     oppressed lot as before.The prisons are as full of unfortunates
     as ever they were, the local tribunals are as corrupt, and Tewfik
     will always oppose their being affiliated to the mixed tribunals
     of Alexandria, and thus afford protection to the judges of the
     local tribunals, should they adjudicate justly.Tewfik is
     essentially one of the Ameer class.I believe he would be willing
     to act uprightly, if by so doing he could maintain his absolute
     power.He has played a difficult game, making stock of his fear
     of his father and of Halim, the legitimate heir according to the
     Moslem, to induce the European Governments to be gentle with him,
     at the same time resisting all measures which would benefit his
     people should these measures touch his absolute power.He is
     liberal only in measures which do not interfere with his
     prerogative."It was inevitable that the present sort of trouble should arise.The Controllers had got the finances in good order, and were
     bound to look to the welfare of the people, which could only be
     done by the curtailment of Tewfik's power.The present
     arrangement of Controllers and Consul-Generals is defective.The
     Consul-Generals are charged with the duty of seeing that the
     country is quiet and the people well treated.They are
     responsible to their Foreign Offices.The Controllers are charged
     with the finances and the welfare of the country, but to whom
     are they responsible?Not to Tewfik; though he pays them, he
     cannot remove them; yet they must get on well with him.Not to
     the Foreign Office, for it is repeatedly said that they are
     Egyptian officials, yet they have to keep on good terms with
     these Foreign Offices.Not to the bondholders, though they are
     bound, considering their power, to be on good terms with them.Not to the inhabitants of Egypt, though these latter are taught
     to believe that every unpopular act is done by the Controllers'
     advice."The only remedy is by the formation of a Council of Notables,
     having direct access to Tewfik, and independent of his or of the
     Ministers' goodwill, and the subjection of the Controllers to the
     Consul-Generals responsible to the Foreign Office--in fact,
     Residents at the Court.This would be no innovation, for the
     supervision exists now, except under the Controllers and
     Consul-Generals.It is simply proposed to amalgamate Controllers
     with Consul-Generals, and to give these latter the position of
     Residents.By this means the continual change of French
     Consul-Generals would be avoided, and the consequent ill-feeling
     between France and England would disappear.Should the Residents
     fall out, the matter would be easily settled by the Governments.As it is at present, a quadruple combat goes on; sometimes it is
     one Consul-General against the other Consul-General, aided by the
     two Controllers, or a Consul-General and one Controller against
     the other Consul-General and the other Controller, in all of
     which combats Tewfik gains and the people lose."One thing should certainly be done--the giving of concessions
     ought not to be in the power of Controllers, nor if
     Consul-Generals are amalgamated with Controllers as Residents
     should these Residents have this power.It ought to be exercised
     by the Council of Notables, who would look to the welfare of the
     people."The progress of events in Lower Egypt during 1881 and 1882 was watched
with great care, whether he was vegetating in the Mauritius or
absorbed in the anxieties and labours of his South African mission.Commenting on the downfall of Arabi, he explained how the despatch of
troops to the Soudan, composed of regiments tainted with a spirit of
insubordination, would inevitably aggravate the situation there.Later
on, in 1883, when he heard of Hicks being sent to take the command and
repair the defeat of Yusuf, he wrote:--"Unless Hicks is given supreme
command he is lost; it can never work putting him in a subordinate
position.Hicks must be made Governor-General, otherwise he will never
end things satisfactorily."At the same time, he came to the
conclusion that there was only one man who could save Egypt, and that
was Nubar Pasha.He wrote:--"If they do not make Nubar Pasha Prime
Minister or Regent in Egypt they will have trouble, as he is the only
man who can rule that country."This testimony to Nubar's capacity is
the more remarkable and creditable, as in earlier days Gordon had not
appreciated the merit of a statesman who has done more for Egypt than
any other of his generation.But at a very early stage of the Soudan
troubles Gordon convinced himself that the radical cause of these
difficulties and misfortunes was not the shortcomings and errors of
any particular subordinate, but the complete want of a definite policy
on the part, not of the Khedive and his advisers, but of the British
Government itself.He wrote on this point to a friend (2nd September
1883), almost the day that Hicks was to march from Khartoum:--

     "Her Majesty's Government, right or wrong, will not take a
     decided step _in re_ Egypt and the Soudan; they drift, but at the
     same time cannot avoid the _onus_ of being the real power in
     Egypt, with the corresponding advantage of being so.It is
     undoubtedly the fact that they maintain Tewfik and the Pashas in
     power against the will of the people; this alone is insufferable
     from disgusting the people, to whom also Her Majesty's Government
     have given no inducement to make themselves popular.Their
     present action is a dangerous one, for without any advantage over
     the Canal or to England, they keep a running sore open with
     France, and are acting in a way which will justify Russia to act
     in a similar way in Armenia, and Austria in Salonica.Further
     than that, Her Majesty's Government must eventually gain the
     odium which will fall upon them when the interest of the debt
     fails to be paid, which will soon be the case.Also, Her
     Majesty's Government cannot possibly avoid the responsibility for
     the state of affairs in the Soudan, where a wretched war drags on
     in a ruined country at a cost of half a million per annum at
     least.I say therefore to avoid all this, _if Her Majesty's
     Government will not act firmly and strongly and take the country_
     (which, if I were they, I would not do), let them attempt to get
     the Palestine Canal made, and quit Egypt to work out its own
     salvation.In doing so lots of anarchy will take place.This
     anarchy is inseparable from a peaceful solution; it is the
     travail in birth.Her Majesty's Government do not prevent anarchy
     now; therefore better leave the country, and thus avoid a
     responsibility which gives no advantage, and is mean and
     dangerous."In a letter to myself, dated 3rd January 1884, from Brussels, he
enters into some detail on matters that had been forgotten or were
insufficiently appreciated, to which the reported appointment of
Zebehr to proceed to the Soudan and stem the Mahdi's advance lent
special interest:--

     "I send you a small note which you can make use of, but I beg you
     will not let my name appear under any circumstances.When in
     London I had printed a pamphlet in Arabic, with all the papers
     (official) concerning Zebehr Pasha and his action in pushing his
     son to rebel.It is not long,
     and would repay translating and publishing.It has all the
     history and the authentic letters found in the divan of Zebehr's
     son when Gessi took his stockade.It is in a cover, blue and
     gold.It was my address to people of Soudan--Apologia.Isaiah
     XIX.19, 20, 21 has a wonderful prophecy about Egypt and the
     saviour who will come from the frontier."The note enclosed was published in _The Times_ of 5th January, and
read as follows:--

     "A correspondent writes that it may seem inexplicable why the
     Mahdi's troops attacked Gezireh, which, as its name signifies, is
     an isle near Berber, but there is an old tradition that the
     future ruler of the Soudan will be from that isle.Zebehr Rahama
     knew this, but he fell on leaving his boat at this isle, and so,
     though the Soudan people looked on him as a likely saviour, this
     omen shook their confidence in him.He was then on his way to
     Cairo after swearing his people to rebel (if he was retained
     there), under a tree at Shaka.Zebehr will most probably be taken
     prisoner by the Mahdi, and will then take the command of the
     Mahdi's forces.The peoples of the Soudan are very superstitious,
     and the fall of the flag by a gust of wind, on the proclamation
     of Tewfik at Khartoum, was looked on as an omen of the end of
     Mehemet Ali's dynasty.There is an old tree opposite Cook's
     office at Jerusalem in Toppet, belonging to an old family, and
     protected by Sultan's Firman, which the Arabs consider will fall
     when the Sultan's rule ends.It lost a large limb during the
     Turco-Russian war, and is now in a decayed state.There can be no
     doubt but that the movement will spread into Palestine, Syria,
     and Hedjaz.At Damascus already proclamations have been posted
     up, denouncing Turks and Circassians, and this was before Hicks
     was defeated.It is the beginning of the end of Turkey.Austria
     backed by Germany will go to Salonica, quieting Russia by letting
     her go into Armenia--England and France neutralising one another."If not too late, the return of the ex-Khedive Ismail to Egypt,
     and the union of England and France to support and control the
     Arab movement, appears the only chance.Ismail would soon come to
     terms with the Soudan, the rebellion of which countries was
     entirely due to the oppression of the Turks and Circassians."These expressions of opinion about Egypt and the Soudan may be said to
have culminated in the remarkable pronouncement Gordon made to Mr W.
T. Stead, the brilliant editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, on 8th
January 1884, which appeared in his paper on the following day.The
substance of that statement is as follows:--

     "So you would abandon the Soudan?But the Eastern Soudan is
     indispensable to Egypt.It will cost you far more to retain your
     hold upon Egypt proper if you abandon your hold of the Eastern
     Soudan to the Mahdi or to the Turk than what it would to retain
     your hold upon Eastern Soudan by the aid of such material as
     exists in the provinces.Darfour and Kordofan must be abandoned.That I admit; but the provinces lying to the east of the White
     Nile should be retained, and north of Sennaar.The danger to be
     feared is not that the Mahdi will march northward through Wady
     Halfa; on the contrary, it is very improbable that he will ever
     go so far north.It arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering
     Mahommedan Power established close to your frontiers will
     exercise upon the population which you govern.In all the cities
     in Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may
     do; and, as he has driven out the intruder and the infidel, they
     may do the same.Nor is it only England that has to face this
     danger.The success of the Mahdi has already excited dangerous
     fermentation in Arabia and Syria.Placards have been posted in
     Damascus calling upon the population to rise and drive out the
     Turks.If the whole of the Eastern Soudan is surrendered to the
     Mahdi, the Arab tribes on both sides of the Red Sea will take
     fire.In self-defence the Turks are bound to do something to cope
     with so formidable a danger, for it is quite possible that if
     nothing is done the whole of the Eastern Question may be reopened
     by the triumph of the Mahdi.I see it is proposed to fortify Wady
     Halfa, and prepare there to resist the Mahdi's attack.You might
     as well fortify against a fever.Contagion of that kind cannot be
     kept out by fortifications and garrisons.But that it is real,
     and that it does exist, will be denied by no one cognisant with
     Egypt and the East.In self-defence the policy of evacuation
     cannot possibly be justified.You have 6000 men in
     Khartoum.You have garrisons
     in Darfour, in Bahr el Gazelle, and Gondokoro.Are they to be
     sacrificed?Their only offence is their loyalty to their
     Sovereign.For their fidelity you are going to abandon them to
     their fate.You say they are to retire upon Wady Halfa.But
     Gondokoro is 1500 miles from Khartoum, and Khartoum is only 350
     from Wady Halfa.How will you move your 6000 men from
     Khartoum--to say nothing of other places--and all the Europeans
     in that city through the desert to Wady Halfa?Where are you
     going to get the camels to take them away?Will the Mahdi supply
     them?If they are to escape with their lives, the garrison will
     not be allowed to leave with a coat on their backs.They will be
     plundered to the skin, and even then their lives may not be
     spared.Whatever you may decide about evacuation, you cannot
     evacuate, because your army cannot be moved.You must either
     surrender absolutely to the Mahdi or defend Khartoum at all
     hazards.The latter is the only course which ought to be
     entertained.The Mahdi's
     forces will fall to pieces of themselves; but if in a moment of
     panic orders are issued for the abandonment of the whole of the
     Eastern Soudan, a blow will be struck against the security of
     Egypt and the peace of the East, which may have fatal
     consequences."The great evil is not at Khartoum, but at Cairo.It is the
     weakness of Cairo which produces disaster in the Soudan.It is
     because Hicks was not adequately supported at the first, but was
     thrust forward upon an impossible enterprise by the men who had
     refused him supplies when a decisive blow might have been struck,
     that the Western Soudan has been sacrificed.The Eastern Soudan
     may, however, be saved if there is a firm hand placed at the helm
     in Egypt."What then, you ask, should be done?I reply, Place Nubar in
     power!Nubar is the one supremely able man among Egyptian
     Ministers.He is proof against foreign intrigue, and he
     thoroughly understands the situation.Place him in power; support
     him through thick and thin; give him a free hand; and let it be
     distinctly understood that no intrigues, either on the part of
     Tewfik or any of Nubar's rivals, will be allowed for a moment to
     interfere with the execution of his plans.You are sure to find
     that the energetic support of Nubar will, sooner or later, bring
     you into collision with the Khedive; but if that Sovereign really
     desires, as he says, the welfare of his country, it will be
     necessary for you to protect Nubar's Administration from any
     direct or indirect interference on his part.Nubar can be
     depended upon: that I can guarantee.He will not take office
     without knowing that he is to have his own way; but if he takes
     office, it is the best security that you can have for the
     restoration of order to the country.Especially is this the case
     with the Soudan.Nubar should be left untrammelled by any
     stipulations concerning the evacuation of Khartoum.There is no
     hurry.The garrisons can hold their own at present.Let them
     continue to hold on until disunion and tribal jealousies have
     worked their natural results in the camp of the Mahdi.Nubar
     should be free to deal with the Soudan in his own way.How he
     will deal with the Soudan, of course, I cannot profess to say;
     but I should imagine that he would appoint a Governor-General at
     Khartoum, with full powers, and furnish him with two millions
     sterling--a large sum, no doubt, but a sum which had much better
     be spent now than wasted in a vain attempt to avert the
     consequences of an ill-timed surrender.Sir Samuel Baker, who
     possesses the essential energy and single tongue requisite for
     the office, might be appointed Governor-General of the Soudan,
     and he might take his brother as Commander-in-Chief."It should be proclaimed in the hearing of all the Soudanese, and
     engraved on tablets of brass, that a permanent Constitution was
     granted to the Soudanese, by which no Turk or Circassian would
     ever be allowed to enter the province to plunder its inhabitants
     in order to fill his own pockets, and that no immediate
     emancipation of slaves would be attempted.Immediate emancipation
     was denounced in 1833 as confiscation in England, and it is no
     less confiscation in the Soudan to-day.Whatever is done in that
     direction should be done gradually, and by a process of
     registration.Mixed tribunals might be established, if Nubar
     thought fit, in which European judges would co-operate with the
     natives in the administration of justice.Police inspectors also
     might be appointed, and adequate measures taken to root out the
     abuses which prevail in the prisons."With regard to Darfour, I should think that Nubar would probably
     send back the family and the heir of the Sultan of Darfour.If
     subsidized by the Government, and sent back with Sir Samuel
     Baker, he would not have much difficulty in regaining possession
     of the kingdom of Darfour, which was formerly one of the best
     governed of African countries.As regards Abyssinia, the old
     warning should not be lost sight of--"Put not your trust in
     princes"; and place no reliance upon the King of Abyssinia, at
     least outside his own country.Zeylah and Bogos might be ceded to
     him with advantage, and the free right of entry by the port of
     Massowah might be added; but it would be a mistake to give him
     possession of Massowah which he would ruin.A Commission might
     also be sent down with advantage to examine the state of things
     in Harrar, opposite Aden, and see what iniquities are going on
     there, as also at Berbera and Zeylah.By these means, and by the
     adoption of a steady, consistent policy at headquarters, it would
     be possible--not to say easy--to re-establish the authority of
     the Khedive between the Red Sea and Sennaar."As to the cost of the Soudan, it is a mistake to suppose that it
     will necessarily be a charge on the Egyptian Exchequer.It will
     cost two millions to relieve the garrisons and to quell the
     revolt; but that expenditure must be incurred any way; and in all
     probability, if the garrisons are handed over to be massacred and
     the country evacuated, the ultimate expenditure would exceed that
     sum.At first, until the country is pacified, the Soudan will
     need a subsidy of L200,000 a year from Egypt.That, however,
     would be temporary.During the last years of my administration
     the Soudan involved no charge upon the Egyptian Exchequer.The
     bad provinces were balanced against the good, and an equilibrium
     was established.The Soudan will never be a source of revenue to
     Egypt, but it need not be a source of expense.That deficits have
     arisen, and that the present disaster has occurred, is entirely
     attributable to a single cause, and that is, the grossest
     misgovernment."The cause of the rising in the Soudan is the cause of all
     popular risings against Turkish rule, wherever they have
     occurred.No one who has been in a Turkish province, and has
     witnessed the results of the Bashi-Bazouk system, which excited
     so much indignation some time ago in Bulgaria, will need to be
     told why the people of the Soudan have risen in revolt against
     the Khedive.The Turks, the Circassians, and the Bashi-Bazouks
     have plundered and oppressed the people in the Soudan, as they
     plundered and oppressed them in the Balkan peninsula.Oppression
     begat discontent; discontent necessitated an increase of the
     armed force at the disposal of the authorities; this increase of
     the army force involved an increase of expenditure, which again
     was attempted to be met by increasing taxation, and that still
     further increased the discontent.And so things went on in a
     dismal circle, until they culminated, after repeated deficits, in
     a disastrous rebellion.That the people were justified in
     rebelling, nobody who knows the treatment to which they were
     subjected will attempt to deny.Their cries were absolutely
     unheeded at Cairo.In despair, they had recourse to the only
     method by which they could make their wrongs known; and, on the
     same principle that Absalom fired the corn of Joab, so they
     rallied round the Mahdi, who exhorted them to revolt against the
     Turkish yoke.I am convinced that it is an entire mistake to
     regard the Mahdi as in any sense a religious leader: he
     personifies popular discontent.All the Soudanese are potential
     Mahdis, just as all the Egyptians are potential Arabis.The
     movement is not religious, but an outbreak of despair.Three
     times over I warned the late Khedive that it would be impossible
     to govern the Soudan on the old system, after my appointment to
     the Governor-Generalship.During the three years that I wielded
     full powers in the Soudan, I taught the natives that they had a
     right to exist.I waged war against the Turks and Circassians,
     who had harried the population.I had taught them something of
     the meaning of liberty and justice, and accustomed them to a
     higher ideal of government than that with which they had
     previously been acquainted.As soon as I had gone, the Turks and
     Circassians returned in full force; the old Bashi-Bazouk system
     was re-established; my old _employes_ were persecuted; and a
     population which had begun to appreciate something like decent
     government was flung back to suffer the worst excesses of Turkish
     rule.The inevitable result followed; and thus it may be said
     that the egg of the present rebellion was laid in the three years
     during which I was allowed to govern the Soudan on other than
     Turkish principles."The Soudanese are a very nice people.They deserve the sincere
     compassion and sympathy of all civilised men.I got on very well
     with them, and I am sincerely sorry at the prospect of seeing
     them handed over to be ground down once more by their Turkish and
     Circassian oppressors.Yet, unless an attempt is made to hold on
     to the present garrisons, it is inevitable that the Turks, for
     the sake of self-preservation, must attempt to crush them.They
     deserve a better fate.It ought not to be impossible to come to
     terms with them, to grant them a free amnesty for the past, to
     offer them security for decent government in the future.If this
     were done, and the government entrusted to a man whose word was
     truth, all might yet be re-established.So far from believing it
     impossible to make an arrangement with the Mahdi, I strongly
     suspect that he is a mere puppet, put forward by Elias, Zebehr's
     father-in-law, and the largest slave-owner in Obeid, and that he
     had assumed a religious title to give colour to his defence of
     the popular rights."There is one subject on which I cannot imagine any one can
     differ about.That is the impolicy of announcing our intention to
     evacuate Khartoum.Even if we were bound to do so we should have
     said nothing about it.The moment it is known that we have given
     up the game, every man will go over to the Mahdi.All men worship
     the rising sun.The difficulties of evacuation will be enormously
     increased, if, indeed, the withdrawal of our garrison is not
     rendered impossible."The late Khedive, who is one of the ablest and worst-used men in
     Europe, would not have made such a mistake, and under him the
     condition of Egypt proper was much better than it is to-day.Now,
     with regard to Egypt, the same principle should be observed that
     must be acted upon in the Soudan.Let your foundations be broad
     and firm, and based upon the contentment and welfare of the
     people.Hitherto, both in the Soudan and in Egypt, instead of
     constructing the social edifice like a pyramid, upon its base, we
     have been rearing an obelisk which a single push may overturn.Our safety in Egypt is to do something for the people.That is to
     say, you must reduce their rent, rescue them from the usurers,
     and retrench expenditure.Nine-tenths of the European _employes_
     might probably be weeded out with advantage.The remaining
     tenth--thoroughly efficient--should be retained; but, whatever
     you do, do not break up Sir Evelyn Wood's army, which is destined
     to do good work.Stiffen it as much as you please, but with
     Englishmen, not with Circassians.Circassians are as much
     foreigners in Egypt as Englishmen are, and certainly not more
     popular.As for the European population, let them have charters
     for the formation of municipal councils, for raising volunteer
     corps, and for organising in their own defence.Anything more
     shameful than the flight from Egypt in 1882 I never read.Let
     them take an example from Shanghai, where the European settlement
     provides for its own defence and its own government.I should
     like to see a competent special Commissioner of the highest
     standing--such a man, for instance, as the Right Honourable W. E.
     Forster, who is free at once from traditions of the elders and of
     the Foreign Office and of the bondholders, sent out to put Nubar
     in the saddle, sift out unnecessary _employes_, and warn
     evil-doers in the highest places that they will not be allowed to
     play any tricks.If that were done, it would give confidence
     everywhere, and I see no reason why the last British soldier
     should not be withdrawn from Egypt in six months' time."A perusal of these passages will suffice to show the reader what
thoughts were uppermost in Gordon's mind at the very moment when he
was negotiating about his new task for the King of the Belgians on the
Congo, and those thoughts, inspired by the enthusiasm derived from his
noble spirit, and the perfect self-sacrifice with which he would have
thrown himself into what he conceived to be a good and necessary work,
made him the ready victim of a Government which absolutely did not
know what course to pursue, and which was delighted to find that the
very man, whom the public designated as the right man for the
situation, was ready--nay, eager--to take all the burden on his
shoulders whenever his own Government called on him to do so, and to
proceed straight to the scene of danger without so much as asking for
precise instructions, or insisting on guarantees for his own proper
treatment.There is no doubt that from his own individual point of
view, and as affecting any selfish or personal consideration he had at
heart, this mode of action was very unwise and reprehensible, and a
worldly censure would be the more severe on Gordon, because he acted
with his eyes open, and knew that the gravity of the trouble really
arose from the drifting policy and want of purpose of the very
Ministers for whom he was about to dare a danger that Gordon himself,
in a cooler moment, would very likely have deemed it unnecessary to
face.Into the motives that filled him with a belief that he might inspire a
Government, which had no policy, with one created by his own courage,
confidence, and success, it would be impossible to enter, but it can
be confidently asserted that, although they were drawn after him _sed
pede claudo_ to expend millions of treasure and thousands of lives,
they were never inspired by his exhortations and example to form a
definite policy as to the main point in the situation, viz., the
defence of the Egyptian possessions.In the flush of the moment,
carried along by an irresistible inclination to do the things which he
saw could be done, he overlooked all the other points of the case, and
especially that he was dealing with politicians tied by their party
principles, and thinking more of the passage through the House of some
domestic measure of fifth-rate importance than of the maintenance of
an Imperial interest and the arrest of an outbreak of Mahommedan
fanaticism which, if not checked, might call for a crusade.He never thought but that he was
dealing with other Englishmen equally mindful with himself of their
country's fame.If Gordon, long before he took up the task, had been engrossed in the
development of the Soudan difficulty and the Mahdi's power, those who
had studied the question and knew his special qualifications for the
task, had, at a very early stage of the trouble, called upon the
Government to avail themselves of his services, and there is no doubt
that if that advice had been promptly taken instead of slowly,
reluctantly, and only when matters were desperate, there is no doubt,
I repeat, remembering what he did later on, that Gordon would have
been able, without a single English regiment, to have strangled the
Mahdi's power in its infancy, and to have won back the Soudan for the
Khedive.But it may be said, where was it ever prominently suggested that
General Gordon should be despatched to the Soudan at a time before the
Mahdi had become supreme in that region, as he undoubtedly did by the
overthrow of Hicks and his force?I reply by the following quotations from prominent articles written by
myself in _The Times_ of January and February 1883.Until the capture
of El Obeid at that period the movement of the Mahdi was a local
affair of the importance of which no one, at a distance, could attempt
to judge, but that signal success made it the immediate concern of
those responsible in Egypt.On 9th January 1883, in an article in _The
Times_ on "The Soudan," occurs this passage:--

     "It is a misfortune, in the interests of Egypt, of civilisation,
     and of the mass of the Soudanese, that we cannot send General
     Gordon back to the region of the Upper Nile to complete there the
     good work he began eight years ago.With full powers, and with
     the assurance that the good fruits of his labours shall not be
     lost by the subsequent acts of corrupt Pashas, there need be
     little doubt of his attaining rapid success, while the memory of
     his achievements, when working for a half-hearted Government,
     and with incapable colleagues, yet lives in the hearts of the
     black people of the Soudan, and fills one of the most creditable
     pages in the history of recent administration of alien races by
     Englishmen."Again, on 17th February, in another article on the same subject:--

     "The authority of the Mahdi could scarcely be preserved save by
     constant activity and a policy of aggression, which would
     constitute a standing danger to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt.On the other hand, the preservation of the Khedive's sovereign
     rights through our instrumentality will carry with it the
     responsibility of providing the unhappy peoples of Darfour,
     Dongola, Kordofan, and the adjacent provinces with an equitable
     administration and immunity from heavy taxation.The obligation
     cannot be avoided under these, or perhaps under any
     circumstances, but the acceptance of it is not a matter to be
     entertained with an easy mind.The one thing that would reconcile
     us to the idea would be the assurance that General Gordon would
     be sent back with plenary powers to the old scene of his labours,
     and that he would accept the charge."As Gordon was not resorted to when the fall of El Obeid in the early
part of the year 1883 showed that the situation demanded some decisive
step, it is not surprising that he was left in inglorious inaction in
Palestine, while, as I and others knew well, his uppermost thought was
to be grappling with the Mahdi during the long lull of preparing
Hicks's expedition, and of its marching to its fate.The catastrophe
to that force on 4th November was known in London on 22nd November.I urged in every possible way the prompt employment of General Gordon,
who could have reached Egypt in a very short time from his place of
exile at Jaffa.But on this occasion I was snubbed, being told by one
of the ablest editors I have known, now dead, that "Gordon was
generally considered to be mad."However, at this moment the
Government seem to have come to the conclusion that General Gordon had
some qualifications to undertake the task in the Soudan, for at the
end of November 1883, Sir Charles Dilke, then a member of the Cabinet
as President of the Local Government Board, but whose special
knowledge and experience of foreign affairs often led to his assisting
Lord Granville at the Foreign Office, offered the Egyptian Government
Gordon's services.They were declined, and when, on 1st December 1883,
Lord Granville proposed the same measure in a more formal manner, and
asked in an interrogatory form whether General Charles Gordon would be
of any use, and if so in what capacity, Sir Evelyn Baring, now Lord
Cromer, threw cold water on the project, and stated on 2nd December
that "the Egyptian Government were very much averse to employing him."Subsequent events make it desirable to call special attention to the
fact that when, however tardily, the British Government did propose
the employment of General Gordon, the suggestion was rejected, not on
public grounds, but on private.Major Baring did not need to be
informed as to the work Gordon had done in the Soudan, and as to the
incomparable manner in which it had been performed.No one knew better
than he that, with the single exception of Sir Samuel Baker, who was
far too prudent to take up a thankless task, and to remove the
mountain of blunders others had committed, there was no man living who
had the smallest pretension to say that he could cope with the Soudan
difficulty, save Charles Gordon.Yet, when his name is suggested, he
treats the matter as one that cannot be entertained.There is not a
word as to the obvious propriety of suggesting Gordon's name, but the
objection of a puppet-prince like Tewfik is reported as fatal to the
course.Yet six weeks, with the mighty lever of an aroused public
opinion, sufficed to make him withdraw the opposition he advanced to
the appointment, not on public grounds, which was simply impossible,
but, I fear, from private feelings, for he had not forgotten the scene
in Cairo in 1878, when he attempted to control the action of Gordon on
the financial question.There would be no necessity to refer to this
matter, but for its consequences.Had Sir Evelyn Baring done his duty,
and given the only honest answer on 2nd December 1883, that if any one
man could save the situation, that man was Charles Gordon, Gordon
could have reached Khartoum early in January instead of late in
February, and that difference of six weeks might well have sufficed to
completely alter the course of subsequent events, and certainly to
save Gordon's life, seeing that, after all, the Nile Expedition was
only a few days too late.The delay was also attended with fatal
results to the civil population of Khartoum.Had Gordon reached there
early in January he could have saved them all, for as it was he sent
down 2600 refugees, i.e.merchants, old men, women, and children,
making all arrangements for their comfort in the very brief period of
open communication after his arrival, when the greater part of
February had been spent.The conviction that Gordon's appointment and departure were retarded
by personal _animus_ and an old difference is certainly strengthened
by all that follows.Sir Evelyn Baring and the Egyptian Government
would not have Charles Gordon, but they were quite content to entrust
the part of Saviour of the Soudan to Zebehr, the king of the
slave-hunters.On 13th December Lord Granville curtly informed our
representative at Cairo that the employment of Zebehr was inexpedient,
and Gordon in his own forcible way summed the matter up thus: "Zebehr
will manage to get taken prisoner, and will then head the revolt."But while Sir Evelyn Baring would not have Gordon and the British
Cabinet withheld its approval from Zebehr, it was felt that the
situation required that something should be done as soon as possible,
for the Mahdi was master of the Soudan, and at any moment tidings
might come of his advance on Khartoum, where there was only a small
and disheartened garrison, and a considerable defenceless population.The responsible Egyptian Ministers made several suggestions for
dealing with the situation, but they one and all deprecated ceding
territory to the Mahdi, as it would further alienate the tribes still
loyal or wavering and create graver trouble in the future.What they
chiefly contended for was the opening of the Berber-Souakim route with
10,000 troops, who should be Turks, as English troops were not
available.It is important to note that this suggestion did not shock
the Liberal Government, and on 13th December 1883 Lord Granville
replied that the Government had no objection to offer to the
employment of Turkish troops at Souakim for service in the Soudan.In
the following month the Foreign Secretary went one step further, and
"concurred in the surrender of the Soudan to the Sultan."In fact the
British Government were only anxious about one thing, and that was to
get rid of the Soudan, and to be saved any further worry in the
matter.No doubt, if the Sultan had had the money to pay for the
despatch of the expedition, this last suggestion would have been
adopted, but as he had not, the only way to get rid of the
responsibility was to thrust it on Gordon, who was soon discovered to
be ready to accept it without delay or conditions.On 22nd December 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring wrote: "It would be necessary
to send an English officer of high authority to Khartoum with full
powers to withdraw the garrisons, and to make the best arrangements
possible for the future government of the country."News from Khartoum
showed that everything there was in a state verging on panic, that the
people thought they were abandoned by the Government, and that the
enemy had only to advance for the place to fall without a blow.Lastly
Colonel de Coetlogon, the governor after Hicks's death, recommended on
9th January the immediate withdrawal of the garrison from Khartoum,
which he thought could be accomplished if carried out with the
greatest promptitude, but which involved the desertion of the other
garrisons.Abd-el-Kader, ex-Governor-General of the Soudan and
Minister of War, offered to proceed to Khartoum, but when he
discovered that the abandonment of the Soudan was to be proclaimed, he
absolutely refused on any consideration to carry out what he termed a
hopeless errand.All these circumstances gave special point to Sir Evelyn Baring's
recommendation on 22nd December that "an English officer of high
authority should be sent to Khartoum," and the urgency of a decision
was again impressed on the Government in his telegram of 1st January,
because Egypt is on the point of losing the Soudan, and moreover
possesses no force with which to defend the valley of the Nile
downwards.But in the many messages that were sent on this subject
during the last fortnight of the year 1883, the name of the one
"English officer of high authority" specially suited for the task
finds no mention.As this omission cannot be attributed to ignorance,
some different motive must be discovered.At last, on 10th January,
Lord Granville renews his suggestion to send General Gordon, and asks
whether he would not be of some assistance under the altered
circumstances.The "altered circumstances" must have been inserted for
the purpose of letting down Sir Evelyn Baring as lightly as possible,
for the only alteration in the circumstances was that six weeks had
been wasted in coming to any decision at all.On 11th January Sir
Evelyn Baring replied that he and Nubar Pasha did not think Gordon's
services could be utilised, and yet three weeks before he had
recommended that "an English officer of high authority" should be
sent, and he had even complained because prompter measures were not
taken to give effect to his recommendation.The only possible
conclusion is that, in Sir Evelyn Baring's opinion, General Gordon was
not "an English officer of high authority."As if to make his views
more emphatic, Sir Evelyn Baring on 15th January again telegraphed for
an English officer with the intentional and conspicuous omission of
Gordon's name, which had been three times urged upon him by his own
Government.But determined as Sir Evelyn Baring was that by no act or
word of his should General Gordon be appointed to the Soudan, there
were more powerful influences at work than even his strong will.The publication of General Gordon's views in the _Pall Mall Gazette_
of 9th January 1884 had roused public opinion to the importance and
urgency of the matter.It had also revealed that there was at least
one man who was not in terror of the Mahdi's power, and who thought
that the situation might still be saved.There is no doubt that that
publication was the direct and immediate cause of Lord Granville's
telegram of 10th January; but Sir Evelyn Baring, unmoved by what
people thought or said at home, coldly replied on 11th January that
Gordon is not the man he wants.If there had been no other
considerations in the matter, I have no doubt that Sir Evelyn Baring
would have beaten public opinion, and carried matters in the high,
dictatorial spirit he had shown since the first mention of Gordon's
name.But he had not made allowance for an embarrassed and purposeless
Government, asking only to be relieved of the whole trouble, and
willing to adopt any suggestion--even to resign its place to "the
unspeakable Turk"--so long as it was no longer worried in the matter.At that moment Gordon appears on the scene, ready and anxious to
undertake single-handed a task for which others prescribe armies and
millions of money.Public opinion greets him as the man for the
occasion, and certainly he is the man to suit "that" Government.The
only obstruction is Sir Evelyn Baring.Against any other array of
forces his views would have prevailed, but even for him these are too
strong.On 15th January Gordon saw Lord Wolseley, as described in the last
chapter, and then and there it is discovered and arranged that he will
go to the Soudan, but only at the Government's request, provided the
King of the Belgians will consent to his postponing the fulfilment of
his promise, as Gordon knows he cannot help but do, for it was given
on the express stipulation that the claim of his own country should
always come first.King Leopold, who has behaved throughout with
generosity, and the most kind consideration towards Gordon, is
naturally displeased and upset, but he feels that he cannot restrain
Gordon or insist on the letter of his bond.The Congo Mission is
therefore broken off or suspended, as described in the last chapter.In the evening of the 15th Lord Granville despatched a telegram to Sir
Evelyn Baring, no longer asking his opinion or advice, but stating
that the Government have determined to send General Gordon to the
Soudan, and that he will start without delay.To that telegram the
British representative could make no demur short of resigning his
post, but at last the grudging admission was wrung from him that
"Gordon would be the best man."This conclusion, to which anyone
conversant with the facts, as Sir Evelyn Baring was, would have come
at once, was therefore only arrived at seven weeks after Sir Charles
Dilke first brought forward Gordon's name as the right person to deal
with the Soudan difficulty.That loss of time was irreparable, and in
the end proved fatal to Gordon himself.In describing the last mission, betrayal, and death of Gordon, the
heavy responsibility of assigning the just blame to those individuals
who were in a special degree the cause of that hero's fate cannot be
shirked by any writer pretending to record history.Lord Cromer has
filled a difficult post in Egypt for many years with advantage to his
country, but in the matter of General Gordon's last Nile mission he
allowed his personal feelings to obscure his judgment.He knew that
Gordon was a difficult, let it be granted an impossible, colleague;
that he would do things in his own way in defiance of diplomatic
timidity and official rigidity; and that, instead of there being in
the Egyptian firmament the one planet Baring, there would be only the
single sun of Gordon.All these considerations were human, but they
none the less show that he allowed his private feelings, his
resentment at Gordon's treatment of him in 1878, to bias his judgment
in a matter of public moment.It was his opposition alone that
retarded Gordon's departure by seven weeks, and indeed the delay was
longer, as Gordon was then at Jaffa, and that delay, I repeat it
solemnly, cost Gordon his life.Whoever else was to blame afterwards,
the first against whom a verdict of Guilty must be entered, without
any hope of reprieve at the bar of history, was Sir Evelyn Baring, now
Lord Cromer.Mr Gladstone and his Government are certainly clear of any reflection
in this stage of the matter.They did their best to put forward
General Gordon immediately on the news coming of the Hicks disaster,
and although they might have shown greater determination in compelling
the adoption of their plan, which they were eventually obliged to do,
this was a very venial fault, and not in any serious way blameworthy.Nor did they ever seek to repudiate their responsibility for sending
Gordon to the Soudan, although a somewhat craven statement by Lord
Granville, in a speech at Shrewsbury in September 1885, to the effect
that "Gordon went to Khartoum at his own request," might seem to infer
that they did.This remark may have been a slip, or an incorrect mode
of saying that Gordon willingly accepted the task given him by the
Government, but Mr Gladstone placed the matter in its true light when
he wrote that "General Gordon went to the Soudan at the request of
H.M.Gordon, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Stewart, an officer
who had visited the Soudan in 1883, and written an able report on it,
left London by the Indian mail of 18th January 1884.The decision to
send Colonel Stewart with him was arrived at only at the very last
moment, and on the platform at Charing Cross Station the acquaintance
of the two men bound together in such a desperate partnership
practically began.It is worth recalling that in that hurried and
stirring scene, when the War Office, with the Duke of Cambridge, had
assembled to see him off, Gordon found time to say to one of Stewart's
nearest relations, "Be sure that he will not go into any danger which
I do not share, and I am sure that when I am in danger he will not be
far behind."Gordon's journey to Egypt was uneventful, but after the exciting
events that preceded his departure he found the leisure of his
sea-trip from Brindisi beneficial and advantageous, for the purpose of
considering his position and taking stock of the situation he had to
face.By habit and temperament Gordon was a bad emissary to carry out
cut-and-dried instructions, more especially when they related to a
subject upon which he felt very strongly and held pronounced views.The instructions which the Government gave him were as follows, and I
quote the full text.They were probably not drawn up and in Gordon's
hands more than two hours before he left Charing Cross, and personally
I do not suppose that he had looked through them, much less studied
them.He went to the Soudan to
rescue the garrisons, and to carry out the evacuation of the province
after providing for its administration.The letter given in the
previous chapter shows how vague and incomplete was the agreement
between himself and Ministers.It was nothing more than the expression
of an idea that the Soudan should be evacuated, but how and under what
conditions was left altogether to the chapter of accidents.At the
start the Government's view of the matter and his presented no glaring
difference.They sent General Gordon to rescue and withdraw the
garrisons if he could do so, and they were also not averse to his
establishing any administration that he chose.But the main point on
which they laid stress was that they were to be no longer troubled in
the affair.Gordon's marvellous qualities were to extricate them from
the difficult position in which the shortcomings of the Egyptian
Government had placed them, and beyond that they had no definite
thought or care as to how the remedy was to be discovered and applied.The following instructions should be read by the light of these
reflections, which show that, while they nominally started from the
same point, Gordon and the Government were never really in touch, and
had widely different goals in view:--

                              "FOREIGN OFFICE, _January 18th, 1884_."Her Majesty's Government are desirous that you should proceed at
     once to Egypt, to report to them on the military situation in the
     Soudan, and on the measures which it may be advisable to take for
     the security of the Egyptian garrisons still holding positions in
     that country, and for the safety of the European population in
     Khartoum."You are also desired to consider and report upon the best mode
     of effecting the evacuation of the interior of the Soudan, and
     upon the manner in which the safety and the good administration
     by the Egyptian Government of the ports on the sea-coast can best
     be secured."In connection with this subject, you should pay especial
     consideration to the question of the steps that may usefully be
     taken to counteract the stimulus which it is feared may possibly
     be given to the Slave Trade by the present insurrectionary
     movement and by the withdrawal of the Egyptian authority from the
     interior."You will be under the instructions of Her Majesty's Agent and
     Consul-General at Cairo, through whom your Reports to Her
     Majesty's Government should be sent, under flying seal."You will consider yourself authorized and instructed to perform
     such other duties as the Egyptian Government may desire to
     entrust to you, and as may be communicated to you by Sir E.
     Baring.You will be accompanied by Colonel Stewart, who will
     assist you in the duties thus confided to you."On your arrival in Egypt you will at once communicate with Sir
     E. Baring, who will arrange to meet you, and will settle with you
     whether you should proceed direct to Suakin, or should go
     yourself or despatch Colonel Stewart to Khartoum _via_ the Nile."General Gordon had not got very far on his journey before he began to
see that there were points on which it would be better for him to know
the Government's mind and to state his own.Neither at this time nor
throughout the whole term of his stay at Khartoum did Gordon attempt
to override the main decision of the Government policy, viz.to
evacuate the Soudan, although he left plenty of documentary evidence
to show that this was not his policy or opinion.Moreover, his own
policy had been well set forth in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and might
be summed up in the necessity to keep the Eastern Soudan, and the
impossibility of fortifying Lower Egypt against the advance of the
Mahdi.But he had none the less consented to give his services to a
Government which had decided on evacuation, and he remained loyal to
that purpose, although in a little time it was made clear that there
was a wide and impassable gulf between the views of the British
Government and its too brilliant agent.The first doubt that flashed through his mind, strangely enough, was
about Zebehr.He knew, of course, that it had been proposed to employ
him, and that Mr Gladstone had not altogether unnaturally decided
against it.But Gordon knew the man's ability, his influence, and the
close connection he still maintained with the Soudan, where his
father-in-law Elias was the Mahdi's chief supporter, and the paymaster
of his forces.I believe that Gordon was in his heart of the opinion
that the Mahdi was only a lay figure, and that the real author of the
whole movement in the Soudan was Zebehr, but that the Mahdi, carried
away by his exceptional success, had somewhat altered the scope of the
project, and given it an exclusively religious or fanatical character.It is somewhat difficult to follow all the workings of Gordon's mind
on this point, nor is it necessary to do so, but the fact that should
not be overlooked is Gordon's conviction in the great power for good
or evil of Zebehr.Thinking this matter over in the train, he
telegraphed from Brindisi to Lord Granville on 30th January, begging
that Zebehr might be removed from Cairo to Cyprus.There is no doubt
as to the wisdom of this suggestion, and had it been adopted the lives
of Colonel Stewart and his companions would probably have been spared,
for, as will be seen, there is good ground to think that they were
murdered by men of his tribe.In Cyprus Zebehr would have been
incapable of mischief, but no regard was paid to Gordon's wish, and
thus commenced what proved to be a long course of indifference.During the voyage from Brindisi to Port-Said Gordon drew up a
memorandum on his instructions, correcting some of the errors that had
crept into them, and explaining what, more or less, would be the best
course to follow.One part of his instructions had to go by the
board--that enjoining him to restore to the ancient families of the
Soudan their long-lost possessions, for there were no such families in
existence.One paragraph in that memorandum was almost pathetic, when
he begged the Government to take the most favourable view of his
shortcomings if he found himself compelled by necessity to deviate
from his instructions.Colonel Stewart supported that view in a very
sensible letter, when he advised the Government, "as the wisest
course, to rely on the discretion of General Gordon and his knowledge
of the country."General Gordon's original plan was to proceed straight to Souakim, and
to travel thence by Berber to Khartoum, leaving the Foreign Office to
arrange at Cairo what his status should be, but this mode of
proceeding would have been both irregular and inconvenient, and it was
rightly felt that he ought to hold some definite position assigned by
the Khedive, as the ruler of Egypt.On arriving at Port-Said he was
met by Sir Evelyn Wood, who was the bearer of a private letter from
his old Academy and Crimean chum, Sir Gerald Graham, begging him to
"throw over all personal feelings" and come to Cairo.The appeal could
not have come from a quarter that would carry more weight with Gordon,
who had a feeling of affection as well as respect for General Graham;
and, moreover, the course suggested was so unmistakably the right one,
that he could not, and did not, feel any hesitation in taking it,
although he was well aware of Sir Evelyn Baring's opposition, which
showed that the sore of six years before still rankled.Gordon
accordingly accompanied Sir Evelyn Wood to Cairo, where he arrived on
the evening of 24th January.On the following day he was received by
Tewfik, who conferred on him for the second time the high office of
Governor-General of the Soudan.It is unnecessary to lay stress on any
minor point in the recital of the human drama which began with the
interview with Lord Wolseley on 15th January, and thence went on
without a pause to the tragedy of 26th January in the following year;
but it does seem strange, if the British Government were resolved to
stand firm to its evacuation policy, that it should have allowed its
emissary to accept the title of Governor-General of a province which
it had decided should cease to exist.This was not the only nor even the most important consequence of his
turning aside to go to Cairo.When there, those who were interested
for various reasons in the proposal to send Zebehr to the Soudan, made
a last effort to carry their project by arranging an interview between
that person and Gordon, in the hope that all matters in dispute
between them might be discussed, and, if possible, settled.Gordon,
whose enmity to his worst foe was never deep, and whose temperament
would have made him delight in a discussion with the arch-fiend, said
at once that he had no objection to meeting Zebehr, and would discuss
any matter with him or any one else.The penalty of this magnanimity
was that he was led to depart from the uncompromising but safe
attitude of opposition and hostility he had up to this observed
towards Zebehr, and to record opinions that were inconsistent with
those he had expressed on the same subject only a few weeks and even
days before.But even in what follows I believe it is safe to discern
his extraordinary perspicuity; for when he saw that the Government
would not send Zebehr to Cyprus, he promptly concluded that it would
be far safer to take or have him with him in the Soudan, where he
could personally watch and control his movements, than to allow him to
remain at Cairo, guiding hostile plots with his money and influence in
the very region whither Gordon was proceeding.This view is supported by the following Memorandum, drawn up by
General Gordon on 25th January 1884, the day before the interview, and
entitled by him "Zebehr Pasha _v._ General Gordon":--

     "Zebehr Pasha's first connection with me began in 1877, when I
     was named Governor-General of Soudan.Zebehr was then at Cairo,
     being in litigation with Ismail Pasha Eyoub, my predecessor in
     Soudan.Zebehr had left his son Suleiman in charge of his forces
     in the Bahr Gazelle.Darfour was in complete rebellion, and I
     called on Suleiman to aid the Egyptian army in May 1877.In June 1877 I went to Darfour, and was engaged with the
     rebels when Suleiman moved up his men, some 6000, to Dara.It was
     in August 1877.He and his men assumed an hostile attitude to the
     Government of Dara.I came down to Dara and went out to
     Suleiman's camp, and asked them to come and see me at Dara.Suleiman and his chiefs did so, and I told them I felt sure that
     they meditated rebellion, but if they rebelled they would perish.I offered them certain conditions, appointing certain chiefs to
     be governors of certain districts, but refusing to let Suleiman
     be Governor of Bahr Gazelle.After some days' parleying, some of
     Suleiman's chiefs came over to my side, and these chiefs warned
     me that, if I did not take care, Suleiman would attack me.I
     therefore ordered Suleiman to go to Shaka, and ordered those
     chiefs who were inclined to accept my terms in another
     direction, so as to separate them.On this Suleiman accepted my
     terms, and he and others were made Beys.He left for Shaka with
     some 4000 men.He looted the country from Dara to Shaka, and did
     not show any respect to my orders.The rebellion in Darfour being
     settled, I went down to Shaka with 200 men.Suleiman was there
     with 4000.Then he came to me and begged me to let him have the
     sole command in Bahr Gazelle.I refused, and I put him, Suleiman,
     under another chief, and sent up to Bahr Gazelle 200 regular
     troops.Things remained quiet in Bahr Gazelle till I was ordered
     to Cairo in April 1878, about the finances.I then saw Zebehr
     Pasha, who wished to go up to Soudan, and I refused.I left for
     Aden in May, and in June 1878 Suleiman broke out in revolt, and
     killed the 200 regular troops at Bahr Gazelle.I sent Gessi
     against him in August 1878, and Gessi crushed him in the course
     of 1879.Gessi captured a lot of letters in the divan of
     Suleiman, one of which was from Zebehr Pasha inciting him to
     revolt.The original of this letter was given by me to H.H.the
     Khedive, and I also had printed a brochure containing it and a
     sort of _expose_ to the people of Soudan why the revolt had been
     put down--viz.that it was not a question of slave-hunting, but
     one of revolt against the Khedive's authority.Copies of this
     must exist.On the production of this letter of Zebehr to
     Suleiman, I ordered the confiscation of Zebehr's property in
     Soudan, and a court martial to sit on Zebehr's case.This court
     martial was held under Hassan Pasha Halmi; the court condemned
     Zebehr to death; its proceedings were printed in the brochure I
     alluded to.Gessi afterwards caught Suleiman and shot him.With
     details of that event I am not acquainted, and I never saw the
     papers, for I went to Abyssinia.Gessi's orders were to try him,
     and if guilty to shoot him.This is all I have to say about
     Zebehr and myself."Zebehr, without doubt, was the greatest slave-hunter who ever
     existed.Zebehr is the most able man in the Soudan; he is a
     capital general, and has been wounded several times.Zebehr has a
     capacity of government far beyond any statesman in the Soudan.All the followers of the Mahdi would, I believe, leave the Mahdi
     on Zebehr's approach, for they are ex-chiefs of Zebehr.Personally, I have a great admiration for Zebehr, for he is a
     man, and is infinitely superior to those poor fellows who have
     been governors of Soudan; but I question in my mind, 'Will Zebehr
     ever forgive me the death of his son?'and that question has
     regulated my action respecting him, for I have been told he bears
     me the greatest malice, and one cannot wonder at it if one is a
     father."I would even now risk taking Zebehr, and would willingly bear
     the responsibility of doing so, convinced, as I am, that Zebehr's
     approach ends the Mahdi, which is a question which has its pulse
     in Syria, the Hedjaz, and Palestine."It cannot be the wish of H.M.'s Government, or of the Egyptian
     Government, to have an intestine war in the Soudan on its
     evacuation, yet such is sure to ensue, and the only way which
     could prevent it is the restoration of Zebehr, who would be
     accepted on all sides, and who would end the Mahdi in a couple of
     months.My duty is to obey orders of H.M.'s Government, _i.e._ to
     evacuate the Soudan as quickly as possible, _vis-a-vis_ the
     safety of the Egyptian employes."To do this I count on Zebehr; but if the addenda is made that I
     leave a satisfactory settlement of affairs, then Zebehr becomes a
     _sine qua non_.'s
     Government or Egyptian Government desire a settled state of
     affairs in Soudan after the evacuation?Do these Governments want
     to be free of this religious fanatic?If they do, then Zebehr
     should be sent; and if the two Governments are indifferent, then
     do not send him, and I have confidence one will (_D.V._) get out
     the Egyptian employes in three or four months, and will leave a
     cockpit behind us.It is not my duty to dictate what should be
     done.I will only say, first, I was justified in my action
     against Zebehr; second, that if Zebehr has no malice personally
     against me, I should take him at once as a humanly certain
     settler of the Mahdi and of those in revolt.I have written this
     Minute, and Zebehr's story may be heard.I only wish that after
     he has been interrogated, I may be questioned on such subjects as
     his statements are at variance with mine.I would wish this
     inquiry to be official, and in such a way that, whatever may be
     the decision come to, it may be come to in my absence."With respect to the slave-trade, I think nothing of it, for
     there will always be slave-trade as long as Turkey and Egypt buy
     the slaves, and it may be Zebehr will or might in his interest
     stop it in some manner.I will therefore sum up my opinion, viz.that I would willingly take the responsibility of taking Zebehr
     up with me if, after an interview with Sir E. Baring and Nubar
     Pasha, they tell 'the mystic feeling' I could trust him, and
     which'mystic feeling' I felt I had for him to-night when I met
     him at Cherif Pasha's house.Zebehr would have nothing to gain in
     hunting me, and I would have no fear.In this affair my desire, I
     own, would be to take Zebehr.I cannot exactly say why I feel
     towards him thus, and I feel sure that his going would settle the
     Soudan affair to the benefit of H.M.'s Government, and I would
     bear the responsibility of recommending it."C. G. GORDON, Major-General."An interview between Gordon and Zebehr was therefore arranged for 26th
January, the day after this memorandum was written.On 25th it should
also be remembered that the Khedive had again made Gordon
Governor-General of the Soudan.Besides the two principals, there were
present at this interview Sir Evelyn Baring, Sir Gerald Graham,
Colonel Watson, and Nubar Pasha.Zebehr protested his innocence of the
charges made against him; and when Gordon reminded him of his letter,
signed with his hand and bearing his seal, found in the divan of his
son Suleiman, he called upon Gordon to produce this letter, which, of
course, he could not do, because it was sent with the other
incriminating documents to the Khedive in 1879.The passage in that
letter establishing the guilt of Zebehr may, however, be cited, it
being first explained that Idris Ebter was Gordon's governor of the
Bahr Gazelle province, and that Suleiman did carry out his father's
instructions to attack him."Now since this same Idris Ebter has not appreciated our kindness
     towards him, nor shown regard for his duty towards God, therefore
     do you accomplish his ejection by compulsory force, threats, and
     menaces, without personal hurt, but with absolute expulsion and
     deprivation from the Bahr-el-Gazelle, leaving no remnant of him
     in that region, no son, and no relation.For he is a
     mischief-maker, and God loveth not them who make mischief."It is highly probable, from the air of confidence with which Zebehr
called for the production of the letter, that, either during the Arabi
rising or in some other way, he had recovered possession of the
original; but Gordon had had all the documents copied in 1879, and
bound in the little volume mentioned in the preceding Memorandum, as
well as in several of his letters, and the evidence as to Zebehr's
complicity and guilt seems quite conclusive.In his Memorandum Gordon makes two conditions: first, "if Zebehr bears
no malice personally against me, I will take him to the Soudan at
once," and this condition is given further force later on in reference
to "the mystic feeling."The second condition was that Zebehr was only
to be sent if the Government desired a settled state of affairs after
the evacuation.From the beginning of the interview it was clear to
those present that no good would come of it, as Zebehr could scarcely
control his feelings, and showed what they deemed a personal
resentment towards Gordon that at any moment might have found
expression in acts.After a brief discussion it was decided to adjourn
the meeting, on the pretence of having search made for the
incriminating document, but really to avert a worse scene.General
Graham, in the after-discussion on Gordon's renewed desire to take
Zebehr with him, declared that it would be dangerous to acquiesce; and
Colonel Watson plainly stated that it would mean the death of one or
both of them.Gordon, indifferent to all considerations of personal
danger, did not take the same view of Zebehr's attitude towards him
personally, and would still have taken him with him, if only on the
ground that he would be less dangerous in the Soudan than at Cairo;
but the authorities would not acquiesce in a proposition that they
considered would inevitably entail the murder of Gordon at an early
stage of the journey.They cannot, from any point of view, be greatly
blamed in this matter; and when Gordon complains later on, as he
frequently did complain, about the matter, the decision must be with
his friends at Cairo, for they strictly conformed with the first
condition specified in his own Memorandum.At the same time, he was
perfectly correct in his views as to Zebehr's power and capacity for
mischief, and it was certainly very unfortunate and wrong that his
earlier suggestion of removing him to Cyprus or some other place of
safety was not adopted.The following new correspondence will at least suggest a doubt whether
Gordon was not more correct in his view of Zebehr's attitude towards
himself than his friends.What they deemed strong resentment and a
bitter personal feeling towards Gordon on the part of Zebehr, he
considered merely the passing excitement from discussing a matter of
great moment and interest.He would still have taken Zebehr with him,
and for many weeks after his arrival at Khartoum he expected that, in
reply to his frequently reiterated messages, "Send me Zebehr," the
ex-Dictator of the Soudan would be sent up from Cairo.In one of the
last letters to his sister, dated Khartoum, 5th March 1884, he wrote:
"I hope _much_ from Zebehr's coming up, for he is so well known to all
up here."Some time after communications were broken off with Khartoum, Miss
Gordon wrote to Zebehr, begging him to use his influence with the
Mahdi to get letters for his family to and from General Gordon.To
that Zebehr replied as follows:--

     "TO HER EXCELLENCY MISS GORDON,--I am very grateful to you for
     having had the honour of receiving your letter of the 13th, and
     am very sorry to say that I am not able to write to the Mahdi,
     because he is new, and has appeared lately in the Soudan.I do
     not know him.He is not of my tribe nor of my relations, nor of
     the tribes with which I was on friendly terms; and for these
     reasons I do not see the way in which I could carry out your
     wish.I am ready to serve you in all that is possible all my life
     through, but please accept my excuse in this matter.ZEBEHR RAHAMAH, Pasha."CAIRO, _22nd January 1885_."Some time after the fall of Khartoum, Miss Gordon made a further
communication to Zebehr, but, owing to his having been exiled to
Gibraltar, it was not until October 1887 that she received the
following reply, which is certainly curious; and I believe that this
letter and personal conversations with Zebehr induced one of the
officers present at the interview on 26th January 1884 to change his
original opinion, and to conclude that it would have been safe for
General Gordon to have taken Zebehr with him:--

                              "CAIRO [_received by Miss Gordon
                                  about 12th October 1887_]."HONOURABLE LADY,--I most respectfully beg to acknowledge the
     receipt of your letter, enclosed to that addressed to me by His
     Excellency Watson Pasha."This letter has caused me a great satisfaction, as it speaks of
     the friendly relations that existed between me and the late
     Gordon Pasha, your brother, whom you have replaced in my heart,
     and this has been ascertained to me by your inquiring about me
     and your congratulating me for my return to Cairo" [that is,
     after his banishment to Gibraltar]."I consider that your poor brother is still alive in you, and for
     the whole run of my life I put myself at your disposal, and beg
     that you will count upon me as a true and faithful friend to you."You will also kindly pay my respects to the whole family of
     Gordon Pasha, and may you not deprive me of your good news at any
     time."My children and all my family join themselves to me, and pay you
     their best respects."Further, I beg to inform you that the messenger who had been
     previously sent through me, carrying Government correspondence to
     your brother, Gordon Pasha, has reached him, and remitted the
     letter he had in his own hands, and without the interference of
     any other person.The details of his history are mentioned in the
     enclosed report, which I hope you will kindly read.--Believe me,
     honourable Lady, to remain yours most faithfully,

                                             ZEBEHR RAHAMAH.""When I came to Cairo and resided in it as I was before, I kept
     myself aside of all political questions connected with the Soudan
     or others, according to the orders given me by the Government to
     that effect.But as a great rumour was spread over by the high
     Government officials who arrived from the Soudan, and were with
     H.E.General Gordon Pasha at Khartoum before and after it fell,
     that all my properties in that country had been looted, and my
     relations ill-treated, I have been bound, by a hearty feeling of
     compassion, to ask the above said officials what they knew about
     it, and whether the messenger sent by me with the despatches
     addressed by the Government to General Gordon Pasha had reached
     Khartoum and remitted what he had."These officials informed me verbally that on the 25th Ramadan
     1301 (March 1884), at the time they were sitting at Khartoum with
     General Gordon, my messenger, named Fadhalla Kabileblos, arrived
     there, and remitted to the General in his proper hands, and
     without the interference of anyone, all the despatches he had on
     him.After that the General expressed his greatest content for
     the receipt of the correspondence, and immediately gave orders to
     the artillery to fire twenty-five guns, in sign of rejoicing, and
     in order to show to the enemy his satisfaction for the news of
     the arrival of British troops.General Gordon then treated my
     messenger cordially, and requested the Government to pay him a
     sum of L500 on his return to Cairo, as a gratuity for all the
     dangers he had run in accomplishing his faithful mission.Besides
     that, the General gave him, when he embarked with Colonel
     Stewart, L13 to meet his expenses on the journey.A few days
     after the arrival of my messenger at Khartoum, H.E.General
     Gordon thought it proper to appoint Colonel Stewart for coming to
     Cairo on board a man-of-war with a secret mission, and several
     letters, written by the General in English and Arabic, were put
     in two envelopes, one addressed to the British and the other to
     the Egyptian Government, and were handed over to my messenger,
     with the order to return to Cairo with Colonel Stewart on board a
     special steamer."But when Khartoum fell, and the rebels got into it, making all
     the inhabitants prisoners, the Government officials above
     referred to were informed that my messenger had been arrested,
     and all the correspondence that he had on him, addressed by
     General Gordon to the Government, was seized; for when the
     steamer on board of which they were arrived at Abou Kamar she
     went on rocks, and having been broken, the rebels made a massacre
     of all those who were on board; and as, on seeing the letters
     carried by my messenger, they found amongst them a private letter
     addressed to me by H.E.Gordon Pasha, expressing his thanks for
     my faithfulness to him, the rebels declared me an infidel, and
     decided to seize all my goods and properties, comprising them in
     their _Beit-el-Mal_ (that is, Treasury) as it happened in fact."Moreover, the members of my family who were in the Soudan were
     treated most despotically, and their existence was rendered most
     difficult."Such a state of things being incompatible with the suspicion
     thrown upon me as regards my faithfulness to the Government, I
     have requested the high Government officials referred to above to
     give me an official certificate to that effect, which they all
     gave; and the enclosed copies will make known to those who take
     the trouble to read them that I have been honest and faithful in
     all what has been entrusted to me.This is the summary of the
     information I have obtained from persons I have reason to
     believe."Some further evidence of Zebehr's feelings is given in the following
letter from him to Sir Henry Gordon, dated in October 1884:--

     "Your favour of 3rd September has been duly received, for which I
     thank you.I herewith enclose my photograph, and hope that you
     will kindly send me yours."The letter that you wished me to send H.E.General Gordon was
     sent on the 18th August last, registered.I hope that you will
     excuse me in delaying to reply, for when your letter arrived I
     was absent, and when I returned I was very sorry that they had
     not forwarded the letter to me; otherwise I should have replied
     at once."I had closed this letter with the photograph when I received
     fresh news, to the effect that the messengers we sent to H.E.I therefore kept back the
     letter and photograph till they arrived, and I should see what
     tidings they brought.... You have told me that Lord Northbrook
     knows what has passed between us.I endeavoured and devised to
     see His Excellency, but I did not succeed, as he was very busy.I
     presented a petition to him that he should help to recover the
     property of which I was robbed unjustly, and which H.E.your
     brother ordered to be restored, and at the same time to right me
     for the oppression I had suffered.I have had no answer up to
     this present moment.Gordon Pasha will return in safety, accept my
     best regards, dear Sir, and present my compliments to your
     sister.1884._"

To sum up on this important matter.There never was any doubt that the
authorities in the Delta took on themselves a grave responsibility
when they remained deaf to all Gordon's requests for the co-operation
of Zebehr.They would justify themselves by saying that they had a
tender regard for Gordon's own safety.At least this was the only
point on which they showed it, and they would not like to be deprived
of the small credit attached to it; but the evidence I have now
adduced renders even this plea of doubtful force.As to the value of
Zebehr's co-operation, if Gordon could have obtained it there cannot
be two opinions.Gordon did not exaggerate in the least degree when he
said that on the approach of Zebehr the star of the Mahdi would at
once begin to wane, or, in other words, that he looked to Zebehr's
ability and influence as the sure way to make his own mission a
success.On the very night of his interview with Zebehr, and within forty-eight
hours of his arrival in Cairo, General Gordon and his English
companion, with four Egyptian officers, left by train for Assiout, _en
route_ to Khartoum.Before entering on the events of this crowning passage in the career
of this hero, I think the reader might well consider on its threshold
the exact nature of the adventure undertaken by Gordon as if it were a
sort of everyday experience and duty.At the commencement of the year
1884 the military triumph of the Mahdi was as complete as it could be
throughout the Soudan.Khartoum was still held by a force of between
4000 and 6000 men.Although not known, all the other garrisons in the
Nile Valley, except Kassala and Sennaar, both near the Abyssinian
frontier, had capitulated, and the force at Khartoum would certainly
have offered no resistance if the Mahdi had advanced immediately after
the defeat of Hicks.Even if he had reached Khartoum before the
arrival of Gordon, it is scarcely doubtful that the place would have
fallen without fighting.Colonel de Coetlogon was in command, but the
troops had no faith in him, and he had no confidence in them.That
officer, on 9th January, "telegraphed to the Khedive, strongly urging
an immediate withdrawal from Khartoum.He said that one-third of the
garrison are unreliable, and that even if it were twice as strong as
it is, it would not hold Khartoum against the whole country."In
several subsequent telegrams Colonel de Coetlogon importuned the Cairo
authorities to send him authority to leave with the garrison, and on
the very day that the Government finally decided to despatch Gordon he
telegraphed that there was only just enough time left to escape to
Berber.While the commandant held and expressed these views, it is not
surprising that the garrison and inhabitants were disheartened and
decidedly unfit to make any resolute opposition to a confident and
daring foe.There is excellent independent testimony as to the state
of public feeling in the town.Mr Frank Power had been residing in Khartoum as correspondent of _The
Times_ from August 1883, and in December, after the Hicks catastrophe,
he was appointed Acting British Consul.In a letter written on 12th
January he said: "They have done nothing for us yet from Cairo.They
are leaving it all to fate, and the rebels around us are growing
stronger!"Such was the general situation at Khartoum when General
Gordon was ordered, almost single-handed, to save it; and not merely
to rescue its garrison, pronounced by its commander to be partly
unreliable and wholly inadequate, but other garrisons scattered
throughout the regions held by the Mahdi and his victorious legions.A
courageous man could not have been charged with cowardice if he had
shrunk back from such a forlorn hope, and declined to take on his
shoulders the responsibility that properly devolved on the commander
on the spot.A prudent man would at least have insisted that his
instructions should be clear, and that the part his Government and
country were to play was to be as strictly defined and as obligatory
on them as his own.But while Gordon's courage was of such a quality
that I believe no calculation of odds or difficulties ever entered
into his view, his prudence never possessed the requisite amount of
suspicion to make him provide against the contingencies of absolute
betrayal by those who sent him, or of that change in party convenience
and tactics which induced those who first thought his mission most
advantageous as solving a difficulty, or at least putting off a
trouble, to veer round to the conclusion that his remaining at
Khartoum, his honourable but rigid resolve not to return without the
people he went to save, was a distinct breach of contract, and a
serious offence.The state of feeling at Khartoum was one verging on panic.The richest
townsmen had removed their property and families to Berber.Colonel de
Coetlogon had the river boats with steam up ready to commence the
evacuation, and while everyone thought that the place was doomed, the
telegraph instrument was eagerly watched for the signal to begin the
flight.The tension could not have lasted much longer--without the
signal the flight would have begun--when on 24th January the brief
message arrived: "General Gordon is coming to Khartoum."The panic ceased, confidence was
restored, the apathy of the Cairo authorities became a matter of no
importance, for England had sent her greatest name as a pledge of her
intended action, and the unreliable and insufficient garrison pulled
itself together for one of the most honourable and brilliant defences
in the annals of military sieges.Two months had
been wasted, and, as Mr Power said, "the fellows in Lucknow did not
look more anxiously for Colin Campbell than we are looking for
Gordon."Gordon, ever mindful of the importance of time, and fully
impressed with the sense of how much had been lost by delay, did not
let the grass grow under his feet, and after his two days' delay at
Cairo sent a message that he hoped to reach Khartoum in eighteen days.Mr Power's comment on that message is as follows: "Twenty-four days
is the shortest time from Cairo to Khartoum on record; Gordon says he
will be here in eighteen days; but he travels like a whirlwind."As a
matter of fact, Gordon took twenty days' travelling, besides the two
days he passed at Berber.He thus reached Khartoum on 18th February,
and four days later Colonel de Coetlogon started for Cairo.The entry of Gordon into Khartoum was marked by a scene of
indescribable enthusiasm and public confidence.The whole population,
men, women, and children, turned out to welcome him as a conqueror and
a deliverer, although he really came in his own person merely to cope
with a desperate situation.The women threw themselves on the ground
and struggled to kiss his feet; in the confusion Gordon was several
times pushed down; and this remarkable demonstration of popular
confidence and affection was continued the whole way from the
landing-place to the _Hukumdaria_ or Palace.This greeting was the
more remarkable because it was clear that Gordon had brought no
troops--only one white officer--and it soon became known that he had
brought no money.Even the Mahdi himself made his contribution to the
general tribute, by sending General Gordon on his arrival a formal
_salaam_ or message of respect.Thus hailed on all hands as the one
pre-eminently good man who had been associated with the Soudan, Gordon
addressed himself to the hard task he had undertaken, which had been
rendered almost hopeless of achievement by the lapse of time, past
errors, and the blindness of those who should have supported him.Difficult as it had been all along, it was rendered still more
difficult by the decisive defeat of Baker Pasha and an Egyptian force
of 4000 men at Tokar, near Souakim.This victory was won by Osman
Digma, who had been sent by the Mahdi to rouse up the Eastern Soudan
at the time of the threatened Hicks expedition.The result showed that
the Mahdi had discovered a new lieutenant of great military capacity
and energy, and that the Eastern Soudan was for the time as hopelessly
lost to Egypt as Kordofan and Darfour.The first task to which Gordon addressed himself was to place Khartoum
and the detached work at Omdurman on the left bank of the White Nile
in a proper state of defence, and he especially supervised the
establishment of telegraphic communication between the Palace and the
many outworks, so that at a moment's notice he might receive word of
what was happening.His own favourite position became the flat roof of
this building, whence with his glass he could see round for many
miles.He also laid in considerable stores of provisions by means of
his steamers, in which he placed the greatest faith.In all these
matters he was ably and energetically assisted by Colonel Stewart; and
beyond doubt the other Europeans took some slight share in the
incessant work of putting Khartoum in a proper state of defence; but
even with this relief, the strain, increased by constant alarms of the
Mahdi's hostile approach, was intense, and Mr Power speaks of Gordon
as nearly worn out with work before he had been there a month.When Gordon went to the Soudan his principal object was to effect the
evacuation of the country, and to establish there some administration
which would be answerable for good order and good neighbourship.If
the Mahdi had been a purely secular potentate, and not a fanatical
religious propagandist, it would have been a natural and feasible
arrangement to have come to terms with him as the conqueror of the
country.But the basis of the Mahdi's power forbade his being on terms
with anyone.If he had admitted the equal rights of Egypt and the
Khedive at any point, there would have been an end to his heavenly
mission, and the forces he had created out of the simple but
deep-rooted religious feelings of the Mahommedan clans of the Soudan
would soon have vanished.It is quite possible that General Gordon had
in his first views on the Mahdist movement somewhat undervalued the
forces created by that fanaticism, and that the hopes and opinions he
first expressed were unduly optimistic.If so, it must be allowed that
he lost not a moment in correcting them, and within a week of his
arrival at Khartoum he officially telegraphed to Cairo, that "if Egypt
is to be quiet the Mahdi must be smashed up."When the British Government received that message, as they did in a
few days, with, moreover, the expression of supporting views by Sir
Evelyn Baring, they ought to have reconsidered the whole question of
the Gordon mission, and to have defined their own policy.The
representative they had sent on an exceptional errand to relieve and
bring back a certain number of distressed troops, and to arrange if he
could for the formation of a new government through the notabilities
and ancient families, reports at an early stage of his mission that in
his opinion there is no solution of the difficulty, save by resorting
to offensive measures against the Mahdi as the disturber of the peace,
not merely for that moment, but as long as he had to discharge the
divine task implied by his title.As it was of course obvious that
Gordon single-handed could not take the field, the conclusion
necessarily followed that he would require troops, and the whole
character of his task would thus have been changed.In face of that
absolute _volte-face_, from a policy of evacuation and retreat to one
of retention and advance, for that is what it signified, the
Government would have been justified in recalling Gordon, but as they
did not do so, they cannot plead ignorance of his changed opinion, or
deny that, at the very moment he became acquainted with the real state
of things at Khartoum, he hastened to convey to them his decided
conviction that the only way out of the difficulty was to "smash up
the Mahdi."All his early messages show that there had been a change, or at least
a marked modification, in his opinions.At Khartoum he saw more
clearly than in Cairo or in London the extreme gravity of the
situation, and the consequences to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt
that would follow from the abandonment of Khartoum to the Mahdi.He
therefore telegraphed on the day of his arrival these words: "To
withdraw without being able to place a successor in my seat would be
the signal for general anarchy throughout the country, which, though
all Egyptian element were withdrawn, would be a misfortune, and
inhuman."In the same message he repeated his demand for the services
of Zebehr, through whom, as has been shown, he thought he might be
able to cope with the Mahdi.Yet their very refusal to comply with
that reiterated request should have made the authorities more willing
and eager to meet the other applications and suggestion of a man who
had thrust himself into a most perilous situation at their bidding,
and for the sake of the reputation of his country.It must be recorded
with feelings of shame that it had no such effect, and that apathy and
indifference to the fate of its gallant agent were during the first
few months the only characteristics of the Government policy.At the same period all Gordon's telegrams and despatches showed that
he wanted reinforcements to some small extent, and at least military
demonstrations along his line of communication with Egypt to prove
that he possessed the support of his Government, and that he had only
to call upon it to send troops, and they were there to come.He,
naturally enough, treated as ridiculous the suggestion that he had
bound himself to do the whole work without any support; and fully
convinced that he had only to summon troops for them to be sent him in
the moderate strength he alone cared for, he issued a proclamation in
Khartoum, stating that "British troops are now on their way, and in a
few days will reach Khartoum."He therefore begged for the despatch of
a small force to Wady Halfa, and he went on to declare that it would
be "comparatively easy to destroy the Mahdi" if 200 British troops
were sent to Wady Halfa, and if the Souakim-Berber route were opened
up by Indian-Moslem troops.Failing the adoption of these measures, he
asked leave to raise a sum, by appealing to philanthropists,
sufficient to pay a small Turkish force and carry on a contest for
supremacy with the Mahdi on his own behoof.All these suggestions
were more or less supported by Sir Evelyn Baring, who at last
suggested in an important despatch, dated 28th February, that the
British Government should withdraw altogether from the matter, and
"give full liberty of action to General Gordon and the Khedive's
Government to do what seems best to them."Well would it have been for Gordon and everyone whose reputation was
concerned if this step had been taken, for the Egyptian Government,
the Khedive, his ministers Nubar and Cherif, were opposed to all
surrender, and desired to hold on to Khartoum and the Souakim-Berber
route.But without the courage and resolution to discharge it, the
Government saw the obligation that lay on them to provide for the
security and good government of Egypt, and that if they shirked
responsibility in the Soudan, the independence of Egypt might be
accomplished by its own effort and success.They perceived the
objections to giving Egypt a free hand, but they none the less
abstained from taking the other course of definite and decisive action
on their own initiative.As Gordon quickly saw and tersely expressed:
"You will not let Egypt keep the Soudan, you will not take it
yourself, and you will not permit any other country to occupy it."As if to give emphasis to General Gordon's successive
requests--Zebehr, 200 men to Wady Halfa, opening of route from Souakim
to Berber, presence of English officers at Dongola, and of Indian
cavalry at Berber--telegraphic communication with Khartoum was
interrupted early in March, less than a fortnight after Gordon's
arrival in the town.There was consequently no possible excuse for
anyone ignoring the dangerous position in which General Gordon was
placed.He had gone to face incalculable dangers, but now the success
of Osman Digma and the rising of the riparian tribes threatened him
with that complete isolation which no one had quite expected at so
early a stage after his arrival.It ought, and one would have expected
it, to have produced an instantaneous effect, to have braced the
Government to the task of deciding what its policy should be when
challenged by its own representative to declare it.Gordon himself
soon realised his own position, for he wrote: "I shall be caught in
Khartoum; and even if I was mean enough to escape I have not the power
to do so."After a month's interruption he succeeded in getting the
following message, dated 8th April, through, which is significant as
showing that he had abandoned all hope of being supported by his own
Government:--

     "I have telegraphed to Sir Samuel Baker to make an appeal to
     British and American millionaires to give me L300,000 to engage
     3000 Turkish troops from the Sultan and send them here.This
     would settle the Soudan and Mahdi for ever.For my part, I think
     you (Baring) will agree with me.I do not see the fun of being
     caught here to walk about the streets for years as a dervish with
     sandalled feet.Not that (_D.V._) I will ever be taken alive.It
     would be the climax of meanness after I had borrowed money from
     the people here, had called on them to sell their grain at a low
     price, etc., to go and abandon them without using every effort to
     relieve them, whether those efforts are diplomatically correct or
     not; and I feel sure, whatever you may feel diplomatically, I
     have your support, and that of every man professing himself a
     gentleman, in private."Eight days later he succeeded in getting another message through, to
the following effect:--

     "As far as I can understand, the situation is this.You state
     your intention of not sending any relief up here or to Berber,
     and you refuse me Zebehr.I consider myself free to act according
     to circumstances.I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I
     can suppress the rebellion I shall do so.If I cannot, I shall
     retire to the Equator and leave you the indelible disgrace of
     abandoning the garrisons of Senaar, Kassala, Berber, and Dongola,
     with the _certainty_ that you will eventually be forced to smash
     up the Mahdi under greater difficulties if you wish to maintain
     peace in, and, indeed, to retain Egypt."Before a silence of five and a half months fell over Khartoum, Gordon
had been able to make three things clear, and of these only one could
be described as having a personal signification, and that was that the
Government, by rejecting all his propositions, had practically
abandoned him to his fate.The two others were that any settlement
would be a work of time, and that no permanent tranquillity could be
attained without overcoming the Mahdi.Immediately on arriving at Khartoum he perceived that the evacuation
of the Soudan, with safety to the garrison and officials, as well as
the preservation of the honour of England and Egypt, would necessarily
be a work of time, and only feasible if certain measures were taken in
his support, which, considerable as they may have appeared at the
moment, were small and costless in comparison with those that had
subsequently to be sanctioned.Six weeks sufficed to show Gordon that
he would get no material help from the Government, and he then began
to look elsewhere for support, and to propound schemes for pacifying
the Soudan and crushing the Mahdi in which England and the Government
would have had no part.Hence his proposal to appeal to wealthy
philanthropists to employ Turkish troops, and in the last resort to
force his way to the Equator and the Congo.Even that avenue of safety
was closed to him by the illusory prospect of rescue held out to him
by the Government at the eleventh hour, when success was hardly
attainable.For the sake of clearness it will be well to give here a brief summary
of the siege during the six months that followed the arrival of
General Gordon and the departure of Colonel Stewart on 10th September.The full and detailed narrative is contained in Colonel Stewart's
Journal, which was captured on board his steamer.This interesting
diary was taken to the Mahdi at Omdurman, and is said to be carefully
preserved in the Treasury.The statement rests on no very sure
foundation, but if true the work may yet thrill the audience of the
English-speaking world.But even without its aid the main facts of the
siege of Khartoum, down at all events to the 14th December, when
Gordon's own diary stops, are sufficiently well known for all the
purposes of history.At a very early stage of the siege General Gordon determined to try
the metal of his troops, and the experiment succeeded to such a
perfect extent that there was never any necessity to repeat it.On
16th March, when only irregular levies and detached bodies of
tribesmen were in the vicinity of Khartoum, he sent out a force of
nearly 1000 men, chiefly Bashi-Bazouks, but also some regulars, with a
fieldpiece and supported by two steamers.The force started at eight
in the morning, under the command of Colonel Stewart, and landed at
Halfiyeh, some miles down the stream on the right bank of the Nile.Here the rebels had established a sort of fortified position, which it
was desirable to destroy, if it could be done without too much loss.The troops were accordingly drawn up for the attack, and the gun and
infantry fire commenced to cover the advance.At this moment about
sixty rebel horsemen came out from behind the stockade and charged the
Bashi-Bazouks, who fired one volley and fled.The horsemen then
charged the infantry drawn up in square, which they broke, and the
retreat to the river began at a run.Discouraging as this was for a
force of all arms to retire before a few horsemen one-twentieth its
number, the disaster was rendered worse and more disheartening by the
conduct of the men, who absolutely refused to fight, marching along
with shouldered arms without firing a shot, while the horsemen picked
off all who straggled from the column.The gun, a considerable
quantity of ammunition, and about sixty men represented the loss of
Gordon's force; the rebels are not supposed to have lost a single man."Nothing could be more dismal than seeing these horsemen, and some men
even on camels, pursuing close to troops who with shouldered arms
plodded their way back."Thus wrote Gordon of the men to whom he had
to trust for a successful defence of Khartoum.His most recent
experience confirmed his old opinion, that the Egyptian and Arab
troops were useless even when fighting to save their own lives, and he
could only rely on the very small body left of black Soudanese, who
fought as gallantly for him as any troops could, and whose loyalty and
devotion to him surpassed all praise.Treachery, it was assumed, had
something to do with the easy overthrow of this force, and two Pashas
were shot for misconduct on return to Khartoum.Having no confidence in the bulk of his force, it is not surprising
that Gordon resorted to every artifice within engineering science to
compensate for the shortcomings of his army.He surrounded
Khartoum--which on one side was adequately defended by the Nile and
his steamers--on the remaining three sides with a triple line of land
mines connected by wires.Often during the siege the Mahdists
attempted to break through this ring, but only to meet with repulse,
accompanied by heavy loss; and to the very last day of the siege they
never succeeded in getting behind the third of these lines.Their
efficacy roused Gordon's professional enthusiasm, and in one passage
he exclaims that these will be the general form of defence in the
future.During the first months of the siege, which began rather in
the form of a loose investment, the Nile was too low to allow of his
using the nine steamers he possessed, but he employed the time in
making two new ones, and in strengthening them all with bulwarks of
iron plates and soft wood, which were certainly bullet-proof.Each of
these steamers he valued as the equivalent of 2000 men.When it is
seen how he employed them the value will not be deemed excessive, and
certainly without them he could not have held Khartoum and baffled all
the assaults of the Mahdi for the greater part of a year.After this experience Gordon would risk no more combats on land, and
on 25th March he dismissed 250 of the Bashi-Bazouks who had behaved so
badly.Absolutely trustworthy statistics are not available as to the
exact number of troops in Khartoum or as to the proportion the Black
Soudanese bore to the Egyptians, but it approximates to the truth to
say that there were about 1000 of the former to 3000 of the latter,
and with other levies during the siege he doubled this total.For
these and a civilian population of nearly 40,000 Gordon computed that
he had provisions for five months from March, and that for at least
two months he would be as safe as in Cairo.By carefully husbanding
the corn and biscuit he was able to make the supply last much longer,
and even to the very end he succeeded in partially replenishing the
depleted granaries of the town.There is no necessity to repeat the
details of the siege during the summer of 1884.They are made up of
almost daily interchanges of artillery fire from the town, and of
rifle fire in reply from the Arab lines.That this was not merely
child's play may be gathered from two of Gordon's protected ships
showing nearly a thousand bullet-marks apiece.Whenever the rebels
attempted to force their way through the lines they were repulsed by
the mines; and the steamers not only inflicted loss on their fighting
men, but often succeeded in picking up useful supplies of food and
grain.No further reverses were reported, because Gordon was most
careful to avoid all risk, and the only misfortunes occurred in
Gordon's rear, when first Berber, through the treachery of the Greek
Cuzzi, and then Shendy passed into the hands of the Mahdists, thus, as
Gordon said, "completely hemming him in."In April a detached force up
the Blue Nile went over to the Mahdi, taking with them a small
steamer, but this loss was of no great importance, as the men were of
what Gordon called "the Arabi hen or hero type," and the steamer could
not force its way past Khartoum and its powerful flotilla.In the four
months from 16th March to 30th July Gordon stated that the total loss
of the garrison was only thirty killed and fifty or sixty wounded,
while half a million cartridges had been fired against the enemy.The
conduct of both the people and garrison had been excellent, and this
was the more creditable, because Gordon was obliged from the very
beginning, owing to the capture of the bullion sent him at Berber, to
make all payments in paper money bearing his signature and seal.During that period the total reinforcement to the garrison numbered
seven men, including Gordon himself, while over 2600 persons had been
sent out of it in safety as far as Berber.The reader will be interested in the following extracts from a letter
written by Colonel Duncan, R.A., M.P., showing the remarkable way in
which General Gordon organised the despatch of these refugees from
Khartoum.The letter is dated 29th November 1886, and addressed to
Miss Gordon:--

     "When your brother, on reaching Khartoum, found that he could
     commence sending refugees to Egypt, I was sent on the 3rd March
     1884 to Assouan and Korosko to receive those whom he sent down.As an instance of your brother's thoughtfulness, I may mention
     that he requested that, if possible, some motherly European woman
     might also be sent, as many of the refugees whom he had to send
     had never been out of the Soudan before, and might feel strange
     on reaching Egypt.A German, Giegler Pasha, who had been in
     Khartoum with your brother before, and who had a German wife, was
     accordingly placed at my disposal, and I stationed them at
     Korosko, where almost all the refugees arrived.I may mention
     that I saw and spoke to every one of the refugees who came down,
     and to many of the women and children.Their references to your
     brother were invariably couched in language of affection and
     gratitude, and the adjective most frequently applied to him was
     'just.'In sending away the people from Khartoum, he sent away
     the Governor and some of the other leading Egyptian officials
     first.I think he suspected they would intrigue; he always had
     more confidence in the people than in the ruling Turks or
     Egyptians.The oldest soldiers, the very infirm, the wounded
     (from Hicks's battles) were sent next, and a ghastly crew they
     were.But the precautions he took for their comfort were very
     complete, and although immediately before reaching me they had to
     cross a very bad part of the desert between Abou Hamed and
     Korosko, they reached me in wonderful spirits.It was touching to
     see the perfect confidence they had that the promises of Gordon
     Pasha would be fulfilled.After the fall of Khartoum, and your
     brother's death, a good many of the Egyptian officers who had
     been with your brother managed to escape, and to come down the
     river disguised in many cases as beggars.I had an opportunity of
     talking to most of them, and there was no collusion, for they
     arrived at different times and by different roads.I remember
     having a talk with one, and when we alluded to your brother's
     death he burst out crying like a child, and said that though he
     had lost his wives and children when Khartoum was taken, he felt
     it as nothing to the loss of 'that just man.'"The letters written at the end of July at Khartoum reached Cairo at
the end of September, and their substance was at once telegraphed to
England.They showed that, while his success had made him think that
after all there might be some satisfactory issue of the siege, he
foresaw that the real ordeal was yet to come."In four months (that is
end of November) river begins to fall; before that time you _must_
settle the Soudan question."So wrote the heroic defender of Khartoum
in words that could not be misunderstood, and those words were in the
hands of the British Ministers when half the period had expired.At
the same time Mr Power wrote: "We can at best hold out but two months
longer."Gordon at least never doubted what their effect would be, for
after what seemed to him a reasonable time had elapsed to enable this
message to reach its destination, he took the necessary steps to
recover Berber, and to send his steamers half-way to meet and assist
the advance of the reinforcement on which he thought from the
beginning he might surely rely.On 10th September all his plans were completed, and Colonel Stewart,
accompanied by a strong force of Bashi-Bazouks and some black
soldiers, with Mr Power and M. Herbin, the French consul, sailed
northwards on five steamers.The first task of this expedition was if
possible, to retake Berber, or, failing that, to escort the _Abbas_
past the point of greatest danger; the second, to convey the most
recent news about Khartoum affairs to Lower Egypt; and the third was
to lend a helping hand to any force that might be coming up the Nile
or across the desert from the Red Sea.Five days after its departure
Gordon knew through a spy that Stewart's flotilla had passed Shendy in
safety, and had captured a valuable Arab convoy.It was not till
November that the truth was known how the ships bombarded Berber, and
passed that place not only in safety, but after causing the rebels
much loss and greater alarm, and then how Stewart and his European
companions went on in the small steamer _Abbas_ to bear the tale of
the wonderful defence of Khartoum to the outer world--a defence which,
wonderful as it was, really only reached the stage of the miraculous
after they had gone and had no further part in it.So far as Gordon's
military skill and prevision could arrange for their safety, he did
so, and with success.When the warships had to return he gave them the
best advice against treachery or ambuscade:--"Do not anchor near the
bank, do not collect wood at isolated spots, trust nobody."If they had paid strict heed to his advice, there
would have been no catastrophe at Dar Djumna.These reflections invest
with much force Gordon's own view of the matter:--"If _Abbas_ was
captured by treachery, then I am not to blame; neither am I to blame
if she struck a rock, for she drew under two feet of water; if they
were attacked and overpowered, then I am to blame."So perfect were
his arrangements that only treachery, aided by Stewart's
over-confidence, baffled them.With regard to the wisdom of the course pursued in thus sending away
all his European colleagues--the Austrian consul Hensall alone
refusing to quit Gordon and his place of duty--opinions will differ to
the end of time, but one is almost inclined to say that they could not
have been of much service to Gordon once their uppermost thought
became to quit Khartoum.The whole story is told very graphically in a
passage of Gordon's own diary:--

     "I determined to send the _Abbas_ down with an Arab captain.Then
     Stewart said he would go if I would exonerate him from deserting
     me.I said, 'You do not desert me.I cannot go; but if you go you
     do great service.'I then wrote him an official; he wanted me to
     write him an order.I said 'No; for, though I fear not
     responsibility, I will not put you in any danger in which I am
     not myself.'I wrote them a letter couched thus:--'_Abbas_ is
     going down; you say you are willing to go in her if I think you
     can do so in honour.You can go in honour, for you can do
     nothing here; and if you go you do me service in telegraphing my
     views.'"There are two points in this matter to which I must draw marked
attention.The suggestion for any European leaving Khartoum came from
M. Herbin, and when Gordon willingly acquiesced, Colonel Stewart asked
leave to do likewise.Mr Power, whose calculation was that provisions
would be exhausted before the end of September, then followed suit,
and not one of these three of the five Europeans in Khartoum seem to
have thought for a moment what would be the position of Gordon left
alone to cope with the danger from which they ran away.The suggestion
as to their going came in every case from themselves.Gordon, in his
thought for others, not merely threw no obstacle in their way, but as
far as he could provided for their safety as if they were a parcel of
women.But he declined all responsibility for their fate, as they went
not by his order but of their own free-will.He gave them his ships,
soldiers, and best counsel.They neglected the last, and were taken in
in a manner that showed less than a child's suspicion, and were
massacred at the very moment they felt sure of safety.It was a cruel
fate, and a harsh Nemesis speedily befell them for doing perhaps the
one unworthy thing of their lives--leaving their solitary companion to
face the tenfold dangers by which he would be beset.But it cannot be
allowed any longer that the onus of this matter should rest in any way
on Gordon.They went because they wanted to go, and he, knowing well
that men with such thoughts would be of no use to him ("you can do
nothing here") let them go, and even encouraged them to do so.Under
the circumstances he preferred to be alone.Colonel Donald Stewart was
a personal friend of mine, and a man whose courage in the ordinary
sense of the word could not be aspersed, but there cannot be two
opinions that he above all the others should not have left his
brother-in-arms alone in Khartoum.After their departure Gordon had to superintend everything himself,
and to resort to every means of husbanding the limited supply of
provisions he had left.He had also to anticipate a more vigorous
attack, for the Mahdi must quickly learn of the departure of the
steamers, the bombardment of Berber, and the favourable chance thus
provided for the capture of Khartoum.Nor was this the worst, for on
the occurrence of the disaster the Mahdi was promptly informed of the
loss of the _Abbas_ and the murder of the Europeans, and it was he
himself who sent in to Gordon the news of the catastrophe, with so
complete a list of the papers on the _Abbas_ as left no ground for
hope or disbelief.Unfortunately, before this bad news reached Gordon,
he had again, on 30th September, sent down to Shendy three
steamers--the _Talataween_, the _Mansourah_, and _Saphia_, with
troops on board, and the gallant Cassim-el-Mousse, there to await the
arrival of the relieving force.He somewhat later reinforced this
squadron with the _Bordeen_; and although one or two of these boats
returned occasionally to Khartoum, the rest remained permanently at
Shendy, and when the English troops reached the Nile opposite that
place all five were waiting them.Without entering too closely into
details, it is consequently correct to say that during the most
critical part of the siege Gordon deprived himself of the co-operation
of these vessels, each of which he valued at 2000 men, simply and
solely because he believed that reinforcements were close at hand, and
that some troops at the latest would arrive before the end of November
1884.As Gordon himself repeatedly said, it would have been far more
just if the Government had told him in March, when he first demanded
reinforcements as a right, that he must shift for himself.Then he
would have kept these boats by him, and triumphantly fought his way in
them to the Equator.But his trust in the Government, notwithstanding
all his experience, led him to weaken his own position in the hope of
facilitating their movements, and he found their aid a broken reed.In
only one passage of his journal does Gordon give expression to this
view, although it was always present to his mind:--"Truly the
indecision of our Government has been, from a military point of view,
a very great bore, for we never could act as if independent; there was
always the chance of their taking action, which hampered us."But in
the telegrams to Sir Evelyn Baring and Mr Egerton, which the
Government never dared to publish, and which are still an official
secret, he laid great stress on this point, and on Sir Evelyn Baring's
message forbidding him to retire to the Equator, so that, if he sought
safety in that direction, he would be indictable on a charge of
desertion.The various positions at Khartoum held by Gordon's force may be
briefly described.First, the town itself, on the left bank of the
Blue Nile, but stretching almost across to the right bank of the White
Nile, protected on the land side by a wall, in front of which was the
triple line of mines, and on the water side by the river and the
steamers.On the right bank of the Blue Nile was the small North Fort.Between the two stretched the island of Tuti, and at each end of the
wall, on the White Nile as well as the Blue, Gordon had stationed a
_santal_ or heavy-armed barge, carrying a gun.Unfortunately, a large
part of the western end of the Khartoum wall had been washed away by
an inundation of the Nile, but the mines supplied a substitute, and so
long as Omdurman Fort was held this weakness in the defences of
Khartoum did not greatly signify.That fort itself lay on the left
bank of the White Nile.It was well built and fairly strong, but the
position was faulty.It lay in a hollow, and the trench of the
extensive camp formed for Hicks's force furnished the enemy with
cover.It was also 1200 yards from the river bank, and when the enemy
became more enterprising it was impossible to keep up communication
with it.In Omdurman Fort was a specially selected garrison of 240
men, commanded by a gallant black officer, Ferratch or Faragalla
Pasha, who had been raised from a subordinate capacity to the
principal command under him by Gordon.Gordon's point of observation
was the flat roof of the Palace, whence he could see everything with
his telescope, and where he placed his best shots to bear on any point
that might seem hard pressed.Still more useful was it for the purpose
of detecting the remissness of his own troops and officers, and often
his telescope showed him sentries asleep at their posts, and officers
absent from the points they were supposed to guard.From the end of March until the close of the siege scarcely a day
passed without the exchange of artillery and rifle fire on one side or
the other of the beleaguered town.On special occasions the Khedive's
garrison would fire as many as forty or even fifty thousand rounds of
Remington cartridges, and the Arab fire was sometimes heavier.This
incessant fire, as the heroic defender wrote in his journal, murdered
sleep, and at last he became so accustomed to it that he could tell by
the sound where the firing was taking place.The most distant points
of the defence, such as the _santal_ on the White Nile and Fort
Omdurman, were two miles from the Palace; and although telegraphic
communication existed with them during the greater part of the siege,
the oral evidence as to the point of attack was often found the most
rapid means of obtaining information.This was still more advantageous
after the 12th of November, for on that day communications were cut
between Khartoum and Omdurman, and it was found impossible to restore
them.The only communications possible after that date were by bugle
and flag.At the time of this severance Gordon estimated that the
garrison of Omdurman had enough water and biscuit for six weeks, and
that there were 250,000 cartridges in the arsenal.Gordon did
everything in his power to aid Ferratch in the defence, and his
remaining steamer, the _Ismailia_, after the grounding of the
_Husseinyeh_ on the very day Omdurman was cut off, was engaged in
almost daily encounters with the Mahdists for that purpose.Owing to
Gordon's incessant efforts, and the gallantry of the garrison led by
Ferratch, Omdurman held out more than two months.It was not until
15th January that Ferratch, with Gordon's leave, surrendered, and then
when the Mahdists occupied the place, General Gordon had the
satisfaction of shelling them out of it, and showing that it was
untenable.The severance of Omdurman from Khartoum was the prelude to fiercer
fighting than had taken place at any time during the earlier stages of
the siege, and although particulars are not obtainable for the last
month of the period, there is no doubt that the struggle was
incessant, and that the fighting was renewed from day to day.It was
then that Gordon missed the ships lying idle at Shendy.If he had had
them Omdurman would not have fallen, nor would it have been so easy
for the Mahdi to transport the bulk of his force from the left to the
right bank of the White Nile, as he did for the final assault on the
fatal 26th January.At the end of October the Mahdi, accompanied by a far more numerous
force than Gordon thought he could raise, described by Slatin as
countless, pitched his camp a few miles south of Omdurman.On 8th
November his arrival was celebrated by a direct attack on the lines
south of Khartoum.The rebels in their fear of the hidden mines, which
was far greater than it need have been, as it was found they had been
buried too deep, resorted to the artifice of driving forward cows, and
by throwing rockets among them Gordon had the satisfaction of
spreading confusion in their ranks, repulsing the attack, and
capturing twenty of the animals.Four days later the rebels made the
desperate attack on Omdurman, when, as stated, communications were
cut, and the _Husseinyeh_ ran aground.In attempting to carry her off
and to check the further progress of the rebels the _Ismailia_ was
badly hit, and the incident was one of those only too frequent at all
stages of the siege, when Gordon wrote: "Every time I hear the gun
fire I have a twitch of the heart of gnawing anxiety for my penny
steamers."At the very moment that these fights were in progress he
wrote, 10th November: "To-day is the day I expected we should have had
some one of the Expedition here;" and he also recorded that we "have
enough biscuit for a month or so"--meaning at the outside six weeks.Throughout the whole of November rumours of a coming British
Expedition were prevalent, but they were of the vaguest and most
contradictory character.On 25th November Gordon learnt that it was
still at Ambukol, 185 miles further away from Khartoum than he had
expected, and his only comment under this acute disappointment was,
"This is lively!"Up to the arrival of the Mahdi daily desertions of his Arab and other
soldiers to Gordon took place, and by these and levies among the
townspeople all gaps in the garrison were more than filled up.Such
was the confidence in Gordon that it more than neutralised all the
intrigues of the Mahdi's agents in the besieged town, and scarcely a
man during the first seven months of the siege deserted him; but after
the arrival of the Mahdi there was a complete change in this respect.In the first place there were no more desertions to Gordon, and then
men began to leave him, partly, no doubt, from fear of the Mahdi, or
awakened fanaticism, but chiefly through the non-arrival of the
British Expedition, which had been so much talked about, yet which
never came.Still to all the enemy's invitations to surrender on the
most honourable terms Gordon gave defiant answers."I am here like
iron, and I hope to see the newly-arrived English;" and when the
situation had become little short of desperate, at the end of the
year, he still, with bitter agony at his heart, proudly rejected all
overtures, and sent the haughty message: "Can hold Khartoum for twelve
years."He had read the truth in
all the papers captured on Stewart's steamer, and he knew that
Gordon's resources were nearly spent.Even some of the messages Gordon
sent out by spies for Lord Wolseley's information fell into his hands,
and on one of these Slatin says it was written: "Can hold Khartoum at
the outside till the end of January."Although Gordon may be
considered to have more than held his own against all the power of the
Mahdi down to the capture of Omdurman Fort on 15th January, the Mahdi
knew that his straits must be desperate, and that unless the
expedition arrived he could not hold out much longer.The first
advance of the English troops on 3rd January across the desert towards
the Nile probably warned the enemy that now was the time to renew the
attack with greater vigour, but it does not seem that there is any
justification for the entirely hypothetical view that at any point the
Mahdi could have seized the unhappy town.Omdurman Fort itself fell,
not to the desperate onset of his Ghazis, but from the want of food
and ammunition, and with Gordon's expressed permission to the
commandant to surrender.Unfortunately the details of the most tragic
part of the siege are missing, but Gordon himself well summed up what
he had done up to the end of October when his position was secure, and
aid, as he thought, was close at hand:--

     "The news of Hicks's defeat was known in Cairo three weeks after
     the event occurred; since that date up to this (29th October
     1884) nine people have come up as reinforcements--myself,
     Stewart, Herbin, Hussein, Tongi, Ruckdi, and three servants, and
     not one penny of money.Of those who came up two, Stewart and
     Herbin, have gone down, Hussein is dead; so six alone remain,
     while we must have sent down over 1500 and 700 soldiers, total
     2200, including the two Pashas, Coetlogon, etc.The regulars, who
     were in arrears of pay for three months when I came, are now only
     owed half a month, while the Bashi-Bazouks are owed only a
     quarter month, and we have some L500 in the Treasury.It is quite
     a miracle.We have lost two battles, suffering severe losses in
     these actions of men and arms, and may have said to have
     scrambled through, for I cannot say we can lay claim to any great
     success during the whole time.I believe we have more ammunition
     (Remington) and more soldiers now than when I came up.We have
     L40,000 in Treasury _in paper_ and L500.When I came up there was
     L5000 in Treasury.We have L15,000 out in the town in paper
     money."At the point (14th December) when the authentic history of the
protracted siege and gallant defence of Khartoum stops, a pause may be
made to turn back and describe what the Government and country which
sent General Gordon on his most perilous mission, and made use of his
extraordinary devotion to the call of duty to extricate themselves
from a responsibility they had not the courage to face, had been doing
not merely to support their envoy, but to vindicate their own honour.The several messages which General Gordon had succeeded in getting
through had shown how necessary some reinforcement and support were at
the very commencement of the siege.The lapse of time, rendered the
more expressive by the long period of silence that fell over what was
taking place in the besieged town, showed, beyond need of
demonstration, the gravity of the case and the desperate nature of the
situation.But a very little of the knowledge at the command of the
Government from a number of competent sources would have enabled it to
foresee what was certain to happen, and to have provided some remedy
for the peril long before the following despairing message from Gordon
showed that the hour when any aid would be useful had almost expired.This was the passage, dated 13th December, in the last (sixth) volume
of the Journal, but the substance of which reached Lord Wolseley by
one of Gordon's messengers at Korti on 31st December:--

     "We are going to send down the _Bordeen_ the day after to-morrow,
     and with her I shall send this Journal._If some effort is not
     made before ten days' time the town will fall._ It is
     inexplicable this delay.If the Expeditionary forces have reached
     the river and met my steamers, one hundred men are all that we
     require just to show themselves.... Even if the town falls under
     the nose of the Expeditionary forces it will not in my opinion
     justify the abandonment of Senaar and Kassala, or of the
     Equatorial Province by H.M.All that is absolutely
     necessary is for fifty of the Expeditionary force to get on board
     a steamer and come up to Halfiyeh, and thus let their presence be
     felt.This is not asking much, but it must happen _at once_, or
     it will (as usual) be too late."The motives which induced Mr Gladstone's Government to send General
Gordon to the Soudan in January 1884 were, as has been clearly shown,
the selfish desire to appease public opinion, and to shirk in the
easiest possible manner a great responsibility.They had no policy at
all, but they had one supreme wish, viz.to cut off the Soudan from
Egypt; and if the Mahdi had only known their wishes and pressed on,
and treated the Khartoum force as he had treated that under Hicks,
there would have been no garrisons to rescue, and that British
Government would have done nothing.It recked nothing of the grave
dangers that would have accrued from the complete triumph of the
Mahdi, or of the outbreak that must have followed in Lower Egypt if
his tide of success had not been checked as it was single-handed by
General Gordon, through the twelve months' defence of Khartoum.Still
it could not quite stoop to the dishonour of abandoning these
garrisons, and of making itself an accomplice to the Mahdi's
butcheries, nor could it altogether turn a deaf ear to the
representations and remonstrances of even such a puppet prince as the
Khedive Tewfik.England was then far more mistress of the situation at
Cairo than she is now, but a helpless refusal to discharge her duty
might have provoked Europe into action at the Porte that would have
proved inconvenient and damaging to her position and reputation.Therefore the Government fell back on General Gordon, and the hope was
even indulged that, under his exceptional reputation, the evacuation
of the Soudan might not only be successfully carried out, but that his
success might induce the public and the world to accept that
abnegation of policy as the acme of wisdom.In all this they were
destined to a complete awakening, and the only matter of surprise is
that they should have sent so well-known a character as General
Gordon, whose independence and contempt for official etiquette and
restraint were no secrets at the Foreign and War Offices, on a mission
in which they required him not only to be as indifferent to the
national honour as they were, but also to be tied and restrained by
the shifts and requirements of an embarrassed executive.At a very early stage of the mission the Government obtained evidence
that Gordon's views on the subject were widely different from theirs.They had evidently persuaded themselves that their policy was Gordon's
policy; and before he was in Khartoum a week he not merely points out
that the evacuation policy is not his but theirs, and that although he
thinks its execution is still possible, the true policy is, "if Egypt
is to be quiet, that the Mahdi must be smashed up."The hopes that had
been based on Gordon's supposed complaisance in the post of
representative on the Nile of the Government policy were thus
dispelled, and it became evident that Gordon, instead of being a tool,
was resolved to be master, so far as the mode of carrying out the
evacuation policy with full regard for the dictates of honour was to
be decided.Nor was this all, or the worst of the revelations made to
the Government in the first few weeks after his arrival at Khartoum.While expressing his willingness and intention to discharge the chief
part of his task, viz.the withdrawal of the garrisons, which was all
the Government cared about, he also descanted on the moral duty and
the inevitable necessity of setting up a provisional government that
should avert anarchy and impose some barrier to the Mahdi's progress.All this was trying to those who only wished to be rid of the whole
matter, but Gordon did not spare their feelings, and phrase by phrase
he revealed what his own policy would be and what his inner wishes,
however repressed his charge might keep them, really were.Having told them that "the Mahdi must be smashed up," he went on to
say that "we cannot hurry over this affair" (the future of the Soudan)
"if we do we shall incur disaster," and again that, although "it is a
miserable country it is joined to Egypt, and it would be difficult to
divorce the two."Within a very few weeks, therefore, the Government
learnt that its own agent was the most forcible and damaging critic of
the policy of evacuation, and that the worries of the Soudan question
for an administration not resolute enough to solve the difficulty in a
thorough manner were increased and not diminished by Gordon's mission.At that point the proposition was made and supported by several
members of the Cabinet that Gordon should be recalled.There is no
doubt that this step would have been taken but for the fear that it
would aggravate the difficulties of the English expedition sent to
Souakim under the command of General Gerald Graham to retrieve the
defeat of Baker Pasha.Failing the adoption of that extreme measure,
which would at least have been straightforward and honest, and
ignoring what candour seemed to demand if a decision had been come to
to render Gordon no support, and to bid him shift for himself, the
Government resorted to the third and least justifiable course of all,
viz.of showing indifference to the legitimate requests of their
emissary, and of putting off definite action until the very last
moment.We have seen that Gordon made several specific demands in the first
six weeks of his stay at Khartoum--that is, in the short period before
communication was cut off.He wanted Zebehr, 200 troops at Berber, or
even at Wady Halfa, and the opening of the route from Souakim to the
Nile.To these requests not one favourable answer was given, and the
not wholly unnatural rejection of the first rendered it more than ever
necessary to comply with the others.They were such as ought to have
been granted, and in anticipation they had been suggested and
discussed before Gordon felt bound to urge them as necessary for the
security of his position at Khartoum.Even Sir Evelyn Baring had
recommended in February the despatch of 200 men to Assouan for the
moral effect, and that was the very reason why Gordon asked, in the
first place, for the despatch of a small British force to at least
Wady Halfa.It is possible that one of the chief reasons for the
Government rejecting all these suggestions, and also, it must be
remembered, doing nothing in their place towards the relief and
support of their representative, may have been the hope that this
treatment would have led him to resign and throw up his mission.They
would then have been able to declare that, as the task was beyond the
powers of General Gordon, they were only coming to the prudent and
logical conclusion in saying that nothing could be done, and that the
garrisons had better come to terms with the Mahdi.Unfortunately for
those who favoured the evasion of trouble as the easiest and best way
out of the difficulty, Gordon had high notions as to what duty
required.No difficulty had terrors for him, and while left at the
post of power and responsibility he would endeavour to show himself
equal to the charge.Yet there can be no doubt that those who sent him would have rejoiced
if he had formally asked to be relieved of the task he had accepted,
and Mr Gladstone stated on the 3rd April that "Gordon was under no
orders and no restraint to stay at Khartoum."A significant answer to
the fact represented in that statement was supplied, when, ten days
later, silence fell on Khartoum, and remained unbroken for more than
five months.But at the very moment that the Prime Minister made that
statement as to Gordon's liberty of movement, the Government knew of
the candid views which he had expressed as to the proper policy for
the Soudan.It should have been apparent that, unless they and their
author were promptly repudiated, and unless the latter was stripped of
his official authority, the Government would, however tardily and
reluctantly, be drawn after its representative into a policy of
intervention in the Soudan, which it, above everything else,
wished to avoid.He told them "time,"
"reinforcements," and a very considerable expenditure was necessary to
honourably carry out their policy of evacuation.They were not
prepared to concede any of these save the last, and even the money
they sent him was lost because they would send it by Berber instead of
Kassala.But they knew that "the order and restraint" which kept
Gordon at Khartoum was the duty he had contracted towards them when he
accepted his mission, and which was binding on a man of his principles
until they chose to relieve him of the task.The fear of public
opinion had more to do with their abstaining from the step of ordering
his recall than the hope that his splendid energy and administrative
power might yet provide some satisfactory issue from the dilemma, for
at the very beginning it was freely given out that "General Gordon
was exceeding his instructions."The interruption of communications with Khartoum at least suspended
Gordon's constant representations as to what he thought the right
policy, as well as his demands for the fulfilment by the Government of
their side of the contract.It was then that Lord Granville seemed to
pluck up heart of grace, and to challenge Gordon's right to remain at
Khartoum.On 23rd April Lord Granville asked for explanation of "cause
of detention."Unfortunately it was not till months later that the
country knew of Gordon's terse and humorous reply, "cause of
detention, these horribly plucky Arabs."Lord Granville, thinking this
despatch not clear enough, followed it up on 17th May by instructing
Mr Egerton, then acting for Sir Evelyn Baring, to send the following
remonstrance to Gordon:

     "As the original plan for the evacuation of the Soudan has been
     dropped, and as aggressive operations cannot be undertaken with
     the countenance of H.M.'s Government, General Gordon is enjoined
     to consider, and either to report upon, or, if possible, to adopt
     at the first proper moment measures for his own removal and for
     that of the Egyptians at Khartoum who have suffered for him, or
     who have served him faithfully, including their wives and
     children, by whatever route he may consider best, having especial
     regard to his own safety and that of the other British subjects."Then followed suggestions and authority to pay so much a head for
refugees safely escorted to Korosko.The comment Gordon made on that,
and similar despatches, to save himself and any part of the garrison
he could, was that he was not so mean as to desert those who had nobly
stood by him and committed themselves on the strength of his word.It is impossible to go behind the collective responsibility of the
Government and to attempt to fix any special responsibility or blame
on any individual member of that Government.The facts as I read them
show plainly that there was a complete abnegation of policy or purpose
on the part of the British Government, that Gordon was then sent as a
sort of stop-gap, and that when it was revealed that he had strong
views and clear plans, not at all in harmony with those who sent him,
it was thought, by the Ministers who had not the courage to recall
him, very inconsiderate and insubordinate of him to remain at his post
and to refuse all the hints given him, that he ought to resign unless
he would execute a _sauve qui peut_ sort of retreat to the frontier.Very harsh things have been said of Mr Gladstone and his Cabinet on
this point, but considering their views and declarations, it is not so
very surprising that Gordon's boldness and originality alarmed and
displeased them.Their radical fault in these early stages of the
question was not that they were indifferent to Gordon's demands, but
that they had absolutely no policy.They could not even come to the
decision, as Gordon wrote, "to abandon altogether and not care what
happens."But all these minor points were merged in a great common national
anxiety when month after month passed during the spring and summer of
1884, and not a single word issued from the tomb-like silence of
Khartoum.People might argue that the worst could not have happened,
as the Mahdi would have been only too anxious to proclaim his triumph
far and wide if Khartoum had fallen.Anxiety may be diminished, but is
not banished, by a calculation of probabilities, and the military
spirit and capacity exhibited by the Mahdi's forces under Osman Digma
in the fighting with General Graham's well-equipped British force at
Teb and Tamanieb revealed the greatness of the peril with which Gordon
had to deal at Khartoum where he had only the inadequate and
untrustworthy garrison described by Colonel de Coetlogon.During the
summer of 1884 there was therefore a growing fear, not only that the
worst news might come at any moment, but that in the most favourable
event any news would reveal the desperate situation to which Gordon
had been reduced, and with that conviction came the thought, not
whether he had exactly carried out what Ministers had expected him to
do, but solely of his extraordinary courage and devotion to his
country, which had led him to take up a thankless task without the
least regard for his comfort or advantage, and without counting the
odds.There was at least one Minister in the Cabinet who was struck by
that single-minded conduct; and as early as April, when his colleagues
were asking the formal question why Gordon did not leave Khartoum, the
Marquis of Hartington, then Minister of War, and now Duke of
Devonshire, began to inquire as to the steps necessary to rescue the
emissary, while still adhering to the policy of the Administration of
which he formed part.During the whole of that summer the present Duke
of Devonshire advocated the special claim of General Gordon on the
Government, whose mandate he had so readily accepted, and urged the
necessity of special measures being taken at the earliest moment to
save the gallant envoy from what seemed the too probable penalty of
his own temerity and devotion.But for his energetic and consistent
representations the steps that were taken--all too late as they
proved--never would have been taken at all, or deferred to such a date
as to let the public see by the event that there was no use in
throwing away money and precious lives on a lost cause.If the first place among those in power--for of my own and other
journalists' efforts in the Press to arouse public opinion and to urge
the Government to timely action it is unnecessary to speak--is due to
the Duke of Devonshire, the second may reasonably be claimed by Lord
Wolseley.This recognition is the more called for here, because the
most careful consideration of the facts has led me to the conclusion,
which I would gladly avoid the necessity of expressing if it were
possible, that Lord Wolseley was responsible for the failure of the
relief expedition.This stage of responsibility has not yet been
reached, and it must be duly set forth that on 24th July Lord
Wolseley, then Adjutant-General, wrote a noble letter, stating that,
as he "did not wish to share the responsibility of leaving Charley
Gordon to his fate," he recommended "immediate action," and "the
despatch of a small brigade of between three and four thousand British
soldiers to Dongola, so that they might reach that place about 15th
October."But even that date was later than it ought to have been,
especially when the necessity of getting the English troops back as
early in the New Year as possible was considered, and in the
subsequent recriminations that ensued, the blame for being late from
the start was sought to be thrown on the badness of the Nile flood
that year.General Gordon himself cruelly disposed of that theory or
excuse when he wrote, "It was not a bad Nile; quite an average one.Still, Lord Wolseley must not be
robbed of the credit of having said on 24th July that an expedition
was necessary to save Gordon, "his old friend and Crimean comrade,"
towards whom Wolseley himself had contracted a special moral
obligation for his prominent share in inducing him to accept the very
mission that had already proved so full of peril.In short, if the
plain truth must be told, Lord Wolseley was far more responsible for
the despatch of General Gordon to Khartoum than Mr Gladstone.The result of the early representations of the Duke of Devonshire, and
the definite suggestion of Lord Wolseley, was that the Government gave
in when the public anxiety became so great at the continued silence of
Khartoum, and acquiesced in the despatch of an expedition to relieve
General Gordon.Having once made the concession, it must be allowed
that they showed no niggard spirit in sanctioning the expedition and
the proposals of the military authorities.The sum of ten millions was
devoted to the work of rescuing Gordon by the very persons who had
rejected his demands for the hundredth part of that total.Ten
thousand men selected from the _elite_ of the British army were
assigned to the task for which he had begged two hundred men in vain.It is impossible here to enter closely into the causes which led to
the expansion of the three or four thousand British infantry into a
special corps of ten thousand fighting men, picked from the crack
regiments of the army, and composed of every arm of the service
compelled to fight under unaccustomed conditions.The local
authorities--in particular Major Kitchener, now the Sirdar of the
Egyptian army, who is slowly recovering from the Mahdi the provinces
which should never have been left in his possession--protested that
the expedition should be a small one, and if their advice had been
taken the cost would have been about one-fourth that incurred, and the
force would have reached Khartoum by that 11th November on which
Gordon expected to see the first man of it.But Major Kitchener,
although, as Gordon wrote, "one of the few really first-class officers
in the British army," was only an individual, and his word did not
possess a feather's weight before the influence of the Pall Mall band
of warriors who have farmed out our little wars--India, of course,
excepted--of the last thirty years for their own glorification.So
great a chance of fame as "the rescue of Gordon" was not to be left to
some unknown brigadiers, or to the few line regiments, the proximity
of whose stations entitled them to the task.That would be neglecting
the favours of Providence.For so noble a task the control of the most
experienced commander in the British army would alone suffice, and
when he took the field his staff had to be on the extensive scale that
suited his dignity and position.As there would be some reasonable
excuse for the dispensation of orders and crosses from a campaign
against a religious leader who had not yet known defeat, any friend
might justly complain if he was left behind.To justify so brilliant a
staff, no ordinary British force would suffice.Therefore our
household brigade, our heavy cavalry, and our light cavalry were
requisitioned for their best men, and these splendid troops were
drafted and amalgamated into special corps--heavy and light
camelry--for work that would have been done far better and more
efficiently by two regiments of Bengal Lancers.If all this effort and
expenditure had resulted in success, it would be possible to keep
silent and shrug one's shoulders; but when the mode of undertaking
this expedition can be clearly shown to have been the direct cause of
its failure, silence would be a crime.When Lord Wolseley told the
soldiers at Korti on their return from Metemmah, "It was not _your_
fault that Gordon has perished and Khartoum fallen," the positiveness
of his assurance may have been derived from the inner conviction of
his own stupendous error.The expedition was finally sanctioned in August, and the news of its
coming was known to General Gordon in September, before, indeed, his
own despatches of 31st July were received in London, and broke the
suspense of nearly half a year.He thought that only a small force was
coming, under the command of Major-General Earle, and he at once, as
already described, sent his steamers back to Shendy, there to await
the troops and convey them to Khartoum.He seems to have calculated
that three months from the date of the message informing him of the
expedition would suffice for the conveyance of the troops as far as
Berber or Metemmah, and at that rate General Earle would have arrived
where his steamers awaited him early in November.Gordon's views as to
the object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief
Expedition, were thus clearly expressed:--

     "I altogether decline the imputation that the projected
     expedition has come to relieve me.It has come to save our
     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a
     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons.As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I
     wished.Now realise what would happen if this first relief
     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of
     the Mahdi.This second relief expedition (for the honour of
     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat
     hampered.We, the first and second expeditions, are equally
     engaged for the honour of England.I came up
     to extricate the garrison, and failed.Earle comes up to
     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds.Earle does not come to
     extricate me.The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to
     affect our "National honour."If Earle succeeds, the "National
     honour" thanks him, and I hope recommends him, but it is
     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame.I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be."Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an
expedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of
supreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried
out in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and
less exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only
arrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions
reached him in the following form:--"The primary object of your
expedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and
you are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that
object, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations
of any kind are to be undertaken."It had,
however, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the
National honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned
an enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its
long-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart.With
extraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its
purpose, and wrote:--"I very much doubt what is really going to be the
policy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,"
and if they intend ratting out, "the troops had better not come beyond
Berber till the question of what will be done is settled."The receipt of Gordon's and Power's despatches of July showed that
there were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four
months, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of
November.As the greater part of that period had expired when these
documents reached Lord Wolseley's hands, it was quite impossible to
doubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the
situation.The chance of being too late would even then have presented
itself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening
to the rescue of a friend.The news that Colonel Stewart and some
other Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which
reached the English commander from different sources before Gordon
confirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by
showing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the
defence of a populous city.Hard on the heels of that intelligence
came Gordon's letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it
at Dongola on 14th of the same month.The letter was a long one, but
only two passages need be quoted:--"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,
are five steamers with nine guns."Did it not occur to anyone how
greatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened
himself to assist the relieving expedition?Even for that reason there
was not a day or an hour to be lost.But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--"We can
hold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult."Forty
days would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day
Lord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more
alarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no
doubt that the word "difficult" is the official rendering of Gordon's,
a little indistinctly written, word "desperate."In face of that
alarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been
surmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the
leisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the
whole force to Khartoum in the first week of March.Rescue by the most
prominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly
gratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the
previous Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between
Wolseley's plans and Gordon's necessities.The date at which Gordon's supplies would be exhausted varied not from
any miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he
discovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen
from the public granaries before his arrival.The supplies that would
all have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the
middle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but
there is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did
if in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil
population permission to leave the doomed town.From any and from
every point of view, there was not the shadow of an excuse for a
moment's delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November.With the British Exchequer at a commander's back, it is easy to
organise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with
the nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous
plans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time.I have no
doubt if Gordon's letter had said "granaries full, can hold out till
Easter," that Lord Wolseley's deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;
Wady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;
Metemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were
the approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been
fully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill.Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the
verge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force
reached Dongola.It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor
to adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one.To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of
organisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the
effort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that
quick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon's steamers
early in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,
just as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency.Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence
officers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,
specially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less
than fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is
exactly that distance above Debbeh.The Bayuda desert route by the
Jakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles.At Metemmah were the five
steamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to
Khartoum.The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150
miles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a
speedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the
year 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to
make a dash across the desert for Metemmah.The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking
six weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not
of the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one
week, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel
corps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi's
power.When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of
the unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was
effected than if things had been left undisturbed.The erratic policy
in procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not
forthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this
difficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud
Khalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed.Even when the
camels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and
the men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion.The
last reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi
with all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the field.Probably the determining
reason for that decision was that the success of a small force would
have revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly
expedition was.Yet events were to show beyond possibility of
contraversion that this was the case, for not less than two-thirds of
the force were never in any shape or form actively employed, and, as
far as the fate of Gordon went, might just as well have been left at
home.They had, however, to be fed and provided for at the end of a
line of communication of over 1200 miles.Still, notwithstanding all these delays and disadvantages, a
well-equipped force of 1000 men was ready on 30th December to leave
Korti to cross the 170 miles of the Bayuda desert.That route was well
known and well watered.There were wells at, at least, five places,
and the best of these was at Jakdul, about half-way across.The
officer entrusted with the command was Major-General Sir Herbert
Stewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others
impressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the
view of throwing some help into Khartoum.Unfortunately he was
trammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to
establish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water
there he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah.His action was to be
determined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon's, and
so Lord Wolseley arranged throughout.He reached that place with his
1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,
he felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz.to establish
the fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement.It was a case
when Nelson's blind eye might have been called into requisition, but
even the most gallant officers are not Nelsons.The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January
1885, was in every respect a success.It was achieved without loss,
unopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise.The British
relieving force was at last, after many months' report, proved to be
a reality, and although late, it was not too late.If General Stewart
had not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would
undoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops
would have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman.But it
must be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the
required flash of genius.He paid more deference to the orders of Lord
Wolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon.General Stewart returned to Korti on the 7th January, bringing with
him the tired camels, and he found that during his absence still more
urgent news had been received from Gordon, to the effect that if aid
did not come within ten days from the 14th December, the place might
fall, and that under the nose of the expedition.The native who
brought this intimation arrived at Korti the day after General Stewart
left, but a messenger could easily have caught him up and given him
orders to press on at all cost.It was not realised at the time, but
the neglect to give that order, and the rigid adherence to a
preconceived plan, proved fatal to the success of the whole
expedition.The first advance of General Stewart had been in the nature of a
surprise, but it aroused the Mahdi to a sense of the position, and the
subsequent delay gave him a fortnight to complete his plans and assume
the offensive.On 12th January--that is, nine days after his first arrival at
Jakdul--General Stewart reached the place a second time with the
second detachment of another 1000 men--the total fighting strength of
the column being raised to about 2300 men.For whatever errors had
been committed, and their consequences, the band of soldiers assembled
at Jakdul on that 12th of January could in no sense be held
responsible.Without making any invidious comparisons, it may be
truthfully said that such a splendid fighting force was never
assembled in any other cause, and the temper of the men was strung to
a high point of enthusiasm by the thought that at last they had
reached the final stage of the long journey to rescue Gordon.A number
of causes, principally the fatigue of the camels from the treble
journey between Korti and Jakdul, made the advance very slow, and five
days were occupied in traversing the forty-five miles between Jakdul
and the wells at Abou Klea, themselves distant twenty miles from
Metemmah.On the morning of 17th January it became clear that the
column was in presence of an enemy.At the time of Stewart's first arrival at Jakdul there were no hostile
forces in the Bayuda desert.At Berber was a considerable body of the
Mahdi's followers, and both Metemmah and Shendy were held in his name.At the latter place a battery or small fort had been erected, and in
an encounter between it and Gordon's steamers one of the latter had
been sunk, thus reducing their total to four.But there were none of
the warrior tribes of Kordofan and Darfour at any of these places, or
nearer than the six camps which had been established round Khartoum.The news of the English advance made the Mahdi bestir himself, and as
it was known that the garrison of Omdurman was reduced to the lowest
straits, and could not hold out many days, the Mahdi despatched some
of his best warriors of the Jaalin, Degheim, and Kenana tribes to
oppose the British troops in the Bayuda desert.It was these men who
opposed the further advance of Sir Herbert Stewart's column at Abou
Klea.It is unnecessary to describe the desperate assault these
gallant warriors made on the somewhat cumbrous and ill-arranged square
of the British force, or the ease and tremendous loss with which these
fanatics were beaten off, and never allowed to come to close quarters,
save at one point.The infantry soldiers, who formed two sides of the
square, signally repulsed the onset, not a Ghazi succeeded in getting
within a range of 300 yards; but on another side, cavalrymen, doing
infantry soldiers' unaccustomed work, did not adhere to the strict
formation necessary, and trained for the close _melee_, and with the
_gaudia certaminis_ firing their blood, they recklessly allowed the
Ghazis to come to close quarters, and their line of the square was
impinged upon.In that close fighting, with the Heavy Camel Corps men
and the Naval Brigade, the Blacks suffered terribly, but they also
inflicted loss in return.Of a total loss on the British side of
sixty-five killed and sixty-one wounded, the Heavy Camel Corps lost
fifty-two, and the Sussex Regiment, performing work to which it was
thoroughly trained, inflicted immense loss on the enemy at hardly any
cost to itself.Among the slain was the gallant Colonel Fred.Burnaby,
one of the noblest and gentlest, as he was physically the strongest,
officers in the British army.There is no doubt that signal as was
this success, it shook the confidence of the force.The men were
resolute to a point of ferocity, but the leaders' confidence in
themselves and their task had been rudely tried; and yet the breaking
of the square had been clearly due to a tactical blunder, and the
inability of the cavalry to adapt themselves to a strange position.On the 18th January the march, rendered slower by the conveyance of
the wounded, was resumed, but no fighting took place on that day,
although it was clear that the enemy had not been dispersed.On the
19th, when the force had reached the last wells at Abou Kru or Gubat,
it became clear that another battle was to be fought.One of the first
shots seriously wounded Sir Herbert Stewart, and during the whole of
the affair many of our men were carried off by the heavy rifle fire of
the enemy.Notwithstanding that our force fought under many
disadvantages and was not skilfully handled, the Mahdists were driven
off with terrible loss, while our force had thirty-six killed and one
hundred and seven wounded.Notwithstanding these two defeats, the
enemy were not cowed, and held on to Metemmah, in which no doubt those
who had taken part in the battles were assisted by a force from
Berber.The 20th January was wasted in inaction, caused by the large
number of wounded, and when on 21st January Metemmah was attacked, the
Mahdists showed so bold a front that Sir Charles Wilson, who succeeded
to the command on Sir Herbert Stewart being incapacitated by his, as
it proved, mortal wound, drew off his force.This was the more
disappointing, because Gordon's four steamers arrived during the
action and took a gallant part in the attack.It was a pity for the
effect produced that that attack should have been distinctly
unsuccessful.The information the captain of these steamers, the
gallant Cassim el Mousse, gave about Gordon's position was alarming.He stated that Gordon had sent him a message informing him that if aid
did not come in ten days from the 14th December his position would be
desperate, and the volumes of his journal which he handed over to Sir
Charles Wilson amply corroborated this statement--the very last entry
under that date being these memorable words: "Now, mark this, if the
Expeditionary Force--and I ask for no more than 200 men--does not come
in ten days, _the town may fall_, and I have done my best for the
honour of our country.The other letters handed over by Cassim el Mousse amply bore out the
view that a month before the British soldiers reached the last stretch
of the Nile to Khartoum Gordon's position was desperate.In one to his
sister he concluded, "I am quite happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence,
have tried to do my duty," and in another to his friend Colonel
Watson: "I think the game is up, and send Mrs Watson, yourself, and
Graham my adieux.We may expect a catastrophe in the town in or after
ten days.This would not have happened (if it does happen) if our
people had taken better precautions as to informing us of their
movements, but this is'spilt milk.'"In face of these documents,
which were in the hands of Sir Charles Wilson on 21st January, it is
impossible to agree with his conclusion in his book "Korti to
Khartoum," that "the delay in the arrival of the steamers at Khartoum
was unimportant" as affecting the result.Every hour, every minute,
had become of vital importance.If the whole Jakdul column had been
destroyed in the effort, it was justifiable to do so as the price of
reinforcing Gordon, so that he could hold out until the main body
under Lord Wolseley could arrive.I am not one of those who think
that Sir Charles Wilson, who only came on the scene at the last
moment, should be made the scapegoat for the mistakes of others in the
earlier stages of the expedition, and I hold now, as strongly as when
I wrote the words, the opinion that, "in the face of what he did, any
suggestion that he might have done more would seem both ungenerous and
untrue."Still the fact remains that on 21st January there was left a
sufficient margin of time to avert what actually occurred at daybreak
on the 26th, for the theory that the Mahdi could have entered the town
one hour before he did was never a serious argument, while the
evidence of Slatin Pasha strengthens the view that Gordon was at the
last moment only overcome by the Khalifa's resorting to a surprise.On
one point of fact Sir Charles Wilson seems also to have been in error.He fixes the fall of Omdurman at 6th January, whereas Slatin, whose
information on the point ought to be unimpeachable, states that it did
not occur until the 15th of that month.When Sir Herbert Stewart had fought and won the battle of Abou Klea,
it was his intention on reaching the Nile, as he expected to do the
next day, to put Sir Charles Wilson on board one of Gordon's own
steamers and send him off at once to Khartoum.The second battle and
Sir Herbert Stewart's fatal wound destroyed that project.But this
plan might have been adhered to so far as the altered circumstances
would allow.Sir Charles Wilson had succeeded to the command, and many
matters affecting the position of the force had to be settled before
he was free to devote himself to the main object of the dash forward,
viz.the establishment of communications with Gordon and Khartoum.As
the consequence of that change in his own position, it would have been
natural that he should have delegated the task to someone else, and in
Lord Charles Beresford, as brave a sailor as ever led a cutting-out
party, there was the very man for the occasion.Unfortunately, Sir
Charles Wilson did not take this step for, as I believe, the sole
reason that he was the bearer of an important official letter to
General Gordon, which he did not think could be entrusted to any other
hands.But for that circumstance it is permissible to say that one
steamer--there was more than enough wood on the other three steamers
to fit one out for the journey to Khartoum--would have sailed on the
morning of the 22nd, the day after the force sheered off from
Metemmah, and, at the latest, it would have reached Khartoum on
Sunday, the 25th, just in time to avert the catastrophe.But as it was done, the whole of the 22nd and 23rd were taken up in
preparing two steamers for the voyage, and in collecting scarlet coats
for the troops, so that the effect of real British soldiers coming up
the Nile might be made more considerable.on Saturday, the
24th, Sir Charles Wilson at last sailed with the two steamers,
_Bordeen_ and _Talataween_, and it was then quite impossible for the
steamers to cover the ninety-five miles to Khartoum in time.Moreover,
the Nile had, by this time, sunk to such a point of shallowness that
navigation was specially slow and even dangerous.The Shabloka
cataract was passed at 3 P.M.on the afternoon of Sunday; then the
_Bordeen_ ran on a rock, and was not got clear till 9 P.M.On the 27th, Halfiyeh, eight miles from Khartoum, was
reached, and the Arabs along the banks shouted out that Gordon was
killed and Khartoum had fallen.Still Sir Charles Wilson went on past
Tuti Island, until he made sure that Khartoum had fallen and was in
the hands of the dervishes.Then he ordered full steam down stream
under as hot a fire as he ever wished to experience, Gordon's black
gunners working like demons at their guns.On the 29th the
_Talataween_ ran on a rock and sank, its crew being taken on board the
_Bordeen_.Two days later the _Bordeen_ shared the same fate, but the
whole party was finally saved on the 4th February by a third steamer,
brought up by Lord Charles Beresford.But these matters, and the
subsequent progress of the Expedition which had so ignominiously
failed, have no interest for the reader of Gordon's life.It failed to
accomplish the object which alone justified its being sent, and, it
must be allowed, that it accepted its failure in a very tame and
spiritless manner.Even at the moment of the British troops turning
their backs on the goal which they had not won, the fate of Gordon
himself was unknown, although there could be no doubt as to the main
fact that the protracted siege of Khartoum had terminated in its
capture by the cruel and savage foe, whom it, or rather Gordon, had so
long defied.I have referred to the official letter addressed to General Gordon, of
which Sir Charles Wilson was the bearer.That letter has never been
published, and it is perhaps well for its authors that it has not
been, for, however softened down its language was by Lord Wolseley's
intercession, it was an order to General Gordon to resign the command
at Khartoum, and to leave that place without a moment's delay.Had it
been delivered and obeyed (as it might have been, because Gordon's
strength would probably have collapsed at the sight of English
soldiers after his long incarceration), the next official step would
have been to censure him for having remained at Khartoum against
orders.Thus would the primary, and, indeed, sole object of the
Expedition have been attained without regard for the national honour,
and without the discovery of that policy, the want of which was the
only cause of the calamities associated with the Soudan.After the 14th of December there is no trustworthy, or at least,
complete evidence, as to what took place in Khartoum.A copy of one of
the defiant messages Gordon used to circulate for the special purpose
of letting them fall into the hands of the Mahdi was dated 29th of
that month, and ran to the effect, "Can hold Khartoum for years."There was also the final message to the Sovereigns of the Powers,
undated, and probably written, if at all, by Gordon, during the final
agony of the last few weeks, perhaps when Omdurman had fallen.It was
worded as follows:--

     "After salutations, I would at once, calling to mind what I have
     gone through, inform their Majesties, the Sovereigns, of the
     action of Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, who appointed me
     as Governor-General of the Soudan for the purpose of appeasing
     the rebellion in that country."During the twelve months that I have been here, these two
     Powers, the one remarkable for her wealth, and the other for her
     military force, have remained unaffected by my situation--perhaps
     relying too much on the news sent by Hussein Pasha Khalifa, who
     surrendered of his own accord."Although I, personally, am too insignificant to be taken into
     account, the Powers were bound, nevertheless, to fulfil the
     engagement upon which my appointment was based, so as to shield
     the honour of the Governments."What I have gone through I cannot describe.The Almighty God
     will help me."Although this copy was not in Gordon's own writing, it was brought
down by one of his clerks, who escaped from Khartoum, and he declared
that the original had been sent in a cartridge case to Dongola.The
style is certainly the style of Gordon, and there was no one in the
Soudan who could imitate it.It seems safe, as Sir Henry Gordon did,
to accept it as the farewell message of his brother.Until fresh evidence comes to light, that of Slatin Pasha, then a
chained captive in the Mahdi's camp, is alone entitled to the
slightest credence, and it is extremely graphic.We can well believe
that up to the last moment Gordon continued to send out
messages--false, to deceive the Mahdi, and true to impress Lord
Wolseley.The note of 29th December was one of the former; the little
French note on half a cigarette paper, brought by Abdullah Khalifa to
Slatin to translate early in January, may have been one of the latter.It said:--"Can hold Khartoum at the outside till the end of January."Slatin then describes the fall of Omdurman on 15th January, with
Gordon's acquiescence, which entirely disposes of the assertion that
Ferratch, the gallant defender of that place during two months, was a
traitor, and of how, on its surrender, Gordon's fire from the western
wall of Khartoum prevented the Mahdists occupying it.He also comments
on the alarm caused by the first advance of the British force into the
Bayuda desert, and of the despatch of thousands of the Mahdi's best
warriors to oppose it.Those forces quitted the camp at Omdurman
between 10th and 15th January, and this step entirely disposes of the
theory that the Mahdi held Khartoum in the hollow of his hand, and
could at any moment take it.As late as the 15th of January, Gordon's
fire was so vigorous and successful that the Mahdi was unable to
retain possession of the fort which he had just captured.The story had best be continued in the words used by the witness.Six
days after the fall of Omdurman loud weeping and wailing filled the
Mahdi's camp.As the Mahdi forbade the display of sorrow and grief it
was clear that something most unusual had taken place.Then it came
out that the British troops had met and utterly defeated the tribes,
with a loss to the Mahdists of several thousands.Within the next two
or three days came news of the other defeat at Abou Kru, and the loud
lamentations of the women and children could not be checked.The Mahdi
and his chief emirs, the present Khalifa Abdullah prominent among
them, then held a consultation, and it was decided, sooner than lose
all the fruits of the hitherto unchecked triumph of their cause, to
risk an assault on Khartoum.At night on the 24th, and again on the
25th, the bulk of the rebel force was conveyed across the river to the
right bank of the White Nile; the Mahdi preached them a sermon,
promising them victory, and they were enjoined to receive his remarks
in silence, so that no noise was heard in the beleaguered city.By
this time their terror of the mines laid in front of the south wall
had become much diminished, because the mines had been placed too low
in the earth, and they also knew that Gordon and his diminished force
were in the last stages of exhaustion.Finally, the Mahdi or his
energetic lieutenant decided on one more arrangement, which was
probably the true cause of their success.The Mahdists had always
delivered their attack half an hour after sunrise; on this occasion
they decided to attack half an hour before dawn, when the whole scene
was covered in darkness.Slatin knew all these plans, and as he
listened anxiously in his place of confinement he was startled, when
just dropping off to sleep, by "the deafening discharge of thousands
of rifles and guns; this lasted for a few minutes, then only
occasional rifle shots were heard, and now all was quiet again.Could
this possibly be the great attack on Khartoum?A wild discharge of
firearms and cannon, and in a few minutes complete silence!"Some hours afterwards three black soldiers
approached, carrying in a bloody cloth the head of General Gordon,
which he identified.It is unnecessary to add the gruesome details
which Slatin picked up as to his manner of death from the gossip of
the camp.In this terrible tragedy ended that noble defence of
Khartoum, which, wherever considered or discussed, and for all time,
will excite the pity and admiration of the world.There is no need to dwell further on the terrible end of one of the
purest heroes our country has ever produced, whose loss was national,
but most deeply felt as an irreparable shock, and as a void that can
never be filled up by that small circle of men and women who might
call themselves his friends.Ten years elapsed after the eventful
morning when Slatin pronounced over his remains the appropriate
epitaph, "A brave soldier who fell at his post; happy is he to have
fallen; his sufferings are over!"before the exact manner of Gordon's
death was known, and some even clung to the chance that after all he
might have escaped to the Equator, and indeed it was not till long
after the expedition had returned that the remarkable details of his
single-handed defence of Khartoum became known.Had all these
particulars come out at the moment when the public learnt that
Khartoum had fallen, and that the expedition was to return without
accomplishing anything, it is possible that there would have been a
demand that no Minister could have resisted to avenge his fate; but it
was not till the publication of the journals that the exact character
of his magnificent defence and of the manner in which he was treated
by those who sent him came to be understood and appreciated by the
nation.The lapse of time has been sufficient to allow of a calm judgment
being passed on the whole transaction, and the considerations which I
have put forward with regard to it in the chronicle of events have
been dictated by the desire to treat all involved in the matter with
impartiality.If they approximate to the truth, they warrant the
following conclusions.The Government sent General Gordon to the
Soudan on an absolutely hopeless mission for any one or two men to
accomplish without that support in reinforcements on which General
Gordon thought he could count.General Gordon went to the Soudan, and
accepted that mission in the enthusiastic belief that he could arrest
the Mahdi's progress, and treating as a certainty which did not
require formal expression the personal opinion that the Government,
for the national honour, would comply with whatever demands he made
upon it.As a simple matter of fact, every one of those demands, some
against and some with Sir Evelyn Baring's authority, were rejected.No
incident could show more clearly the imperative need of definite
arrangements being made even with Governments; and in this case the
precipitance with which General Gordon was sent off did not admit of
him or the Government knowing exactly what was in the other's mind.Ostensibly of one mind, their views on the matter in hand were really
as far as the poles asunder.There then comes the second phase of the question--the alleged
abandonment of General Gordon by the Government which enlisted his
services in face of an extraordinary, and indeed unexampled danger and
difficulty.The evidence, while it proves conclusively and beyond
dispute that Mr Gladstone's Government never had a policy with regard
to the Soudan, and that even Gordon's heroism, inspiration, and
success failed to induce them to throw aside their lethargy and take
the course that, however much it may be postponed, is inevitable, does
not justify the charge that it abandoned Gordon to his fate.It
rejected the simplest and most sensible of his propositions, and by
rejecting them incurred an immense expenditure of British treasure and
an incalculable amount of bloodshed; but when the personal danger to
its envoy became acute, it did not abandon him, but sanctioned the
cost of the expedition pronounced necessary to effect his rescue.This
decision, too late as it was to assist in the formation of a new
administration for the Soudan, or to bring back the garrisons, was
taken in ample time to ensure the personal safety and rescue of
General Gordon.In the literal sense of the charge, history will
therefore acquit Mr Gladstone and his colleagues of the abandonment of
General Gordon personally.With regard to the third phase of the question--viz.the failure of
the attempt to rescue General Gordon, which was essentially a
military, and not a political question--the responsibility passes from
the Prime Minister to the military authorities who decided the scope
of the campaign, and the commander who carried it out.In this case,
the individual responsible was the same.Lord Wolseley not only had
his own way in the route to be followed by the expedition, and the
size and importance attached to it, but he was also entrusted with its
personal direction.There is consequently no question of the
sub-division of the responsibility for its failure, just as there
could have been none of the credit for its success.Lord Wolseley
decided that the route should be the long one by the Nile Valley, not
the short one from Souakim to Berber.Lord Wolseley decreed that there
should be no Indian troops, and that the force, instead of being an
ordinary one, should be a picked special corps from the _elite_ of the
British army; and finally Lord Wolseley insisted that there should be
no dash to the rescue of Gordon by a small part of his force, but a
slow, impressive, and overpoweringly scientific advance of the whole
body.The extremity of Gordon's distress necessitated a slight
modification of his plan, when, with qualified instructions, which
practically tied his hands, Sir Herbert Stewart made his first
appearance at Jakdul.It was then known to Lord Wolseley that Gordon was in extremities,
yet when a fighting force of 1100 English troops, of special physique
and spirit, was moved forward with sufficient transport to enable it
to reach the Nile and Gordon's steamers, the commander's instructions
were such as confined him to inaction, unless he disobeyed his orders,
which only Nelsons and Gordons can do with impunity.It is impossible
to explain this extraordinary timidity.Sir Herbert Stewart reached
Jakdul on 3rd January with a force small in numbers, but in every
other respect of remarkable efficiency, and with the camels
sufficiently fresh to have reached the Nile on 7th or 8th January had
it pressed on.The more urgent news that reached Lord Wolseley after
its departure would have justified the despatch of a messenger to urge
it to press on at all costs to Metemmah.In such a manner would a
Havelock or Outram have acted, yet the garrison of the Lucknow
Residency was in no more desperate case than Gordon at Khartoum.It does not need to be a professor of a military academy to declare
that, unless something is risked in war, and especially wars such as
England has had to wage against superior numbers in the East, there
will never be any successful rescues of distressed garrisons.Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the advance from Korti to Metemmah,
whence his advance guard did not reach the latter place till the 20th,
instead of the 7th of January.His lieutenant and representative, Sir
Charles Wilson, would not risk anything on the 21st January, whence
none of the steamers appeared at Khartoum until late on the 27th, when
all was over.Each of these statements cannot be impeached, and if so,
the conclusion seems inevitable that in the first and highest degree
Lord Wolseley was alone responsible for the failure to reach Khartoum
in time, and that in a very minor degree Sir Charles Wilson might be
considered blameworthy for not having sent off one of the steamers
with a small reinforcement to Khartoum on the 21st January, before
even he allowed Cassim el Mousse to take any part in the attack on
Metemmah.He could not have done this himself, but he would have had
no difficulty in finding a substitute.When, however, there were
others far more blameworthy, it seems almost unjust to a gallant
officer to say that by a desperate effort he might at the very last
moment have snatched the chestnuts out of the fire, and converted the
most ignominious failure in the military annals of this country into a
creditable success.*       *       *       *       *

The tragic end at Khartoum was not an inappropriate conclusion for the
career of Charles Gordon, whose life had been far removed from the
ordinary experiences of mankind.No man who ever lived was called upon
to deal with a greater number of difficult military and
administrative problems, and to find the solution for them with such
inadequate means and inferior troops and subordinates.In the Crimea
he showed as a very young man the spirit, discernment, energy, and
regard for detail which were his characteristics through life.Those
qualities enabled him to achieve in China military exploits which in
their way have never been surpassed.The marvellous skill, confidence,
and vigilance with which he supplied the shortcomings of his troops,
and provided for the wants of a large population at Khartoum for the
better part of a year, showed that, as a military leader, he was still
the same gifted captain who had crushed the Taeping rebellion twenty
years before.What he did for the Soudan and its people during six
years' residence, at a personal sacrifice that never can be
appreciated, has been told at length; but pages of rhetoric would not
give as perfect a picture as the spontaneous cry of the blacks: "If we
only had a governor like Gordon Pasha, then the country would indeed
be contented.""Such examples are fruitful in the future," said Mr Gladstone in the
House of Commons; and it is as a perfect model of all that was good,
brave, and true that Gordon will be enshrined in the memory of the
great English nation which he really died for, and whose honour was
dearer to him than his life.England may well feel proud of having
produced so noble and so unapproachable a hero.She has had, and she
will have again, soldiers as brave, as thoughtful, as prudent, and as
successful as Gordon.She has had, and she will have again, servants
of the same public spirit, with the same intense desire that not a
spot should sully the national honour.But although this breed is not
extinct, there will never be another Gordon.The circumstances that
produced him were exceptional; the opportunities that offered
themselves for the demonstration of his greatness can never fall to
the lot of another; and even if by some miraculous combination the man
and the occasions arose, the hero, unlike Gordon, would be spoilt by
his own success and public applause.But the qualities which made
Gordon superior not only to all his contemporaries, but to all the
temptations and weaknesses of success, are attainable; and the student
of his life will find that the guiding star he always kept before him
was the duty he owed his country.In that respect, above all others,
he has left future generations of his countrymen a great example._Abbas_, steamer, ii.144;

he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

love-affair, just to see what he would say, but he replied 'no, they
had all been happy ones,' and groaned and groaned."Aunt Beulah has changed too.She has become a suffragette and thinks
only of getting women their rights and their privileges."Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments about the cause.She says that woman's place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and brew like the women of my
grandfather's day, visiting around the way I do?And she says that it
is the principle of the thing that is involved, and I ought to take a
stand for or against.Everybody has so many different arguments that I
don't know what I think yet, but some day I shall make up my mind for
good."Well, that about brings me up to the present.I meant to describe a
few things in detail, but I guess I will not begin on the past in that
way.I don't get so awfully much time to write in this diary because
of the many interruptions of school life, and the way the monitors
snoop in study hours.I don't know who I am going to spend my
Christmas holidays with.I sent Uncle Peter a poem three days ago, but
he has not answered it yet.I'm afraid he thought it was very silly.I
don't hardly know what it means myself.It goes as follows:

                "The moon is very pale to-night,
                  The summer wind swings high,
                I seek the temple of delight,
                  And feel my love draw nigh."I seem to feel his fragrant breath
                  Upon my glowing cheek.Between us blows the wind of death,--
                  I shall not hear him speak."I don't know why I like to write love poems, but most of the women
poets did.CHAPTER XIV

MERRY CHRISTMAS


Margaret in mauve velvet and violets, and Gertrude in a frock of smart
black and white were in the act of meeting by appointment at Sherry's
one December afternoon, with a comfortable cup of tea in mind.Gertrude emerged from the recess of the revolving door and Margaret,
sitting eagerly by the entrance, almost upset the attendant in her
rush to her friend's side.Gertrude," she cried, "I'm so glad to see you.My family is
trying to cut me up in neat little quarters and send me north, south,
east and west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to stay home and
have Eleanor.How did I ever come to be born into a family of giants,
tell me that, Gertrude?""The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an unfortunately immature
period, I'll admit," Gertrude laughed."My parents are dears, but
they've never forgiven me for being an artist instead of a dubby bud.Shall we have tea right away or shall we sit down and discuss life?""I don't know which is the hungrier--flesh or
spirit."But as they turned toward the dining-room a familiar figure blocked
their progress."I thought that was Gertrude's insatiable hat," David exclaimed
delightedly."I've phoned for you both until your families have given
instructions that I'm not to be indulged any more.I've got a surprise
for you.--Taxi," he said to the man at the door."Not till we've had our tea," Margaret wailed."You couldn't be so
cruel, David.""You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of the happiest surprises
of your life into the bargain," David assured her as he led the way to
the waiting cab."I wouldn't leave this place unfed for anybody but you, David, not if
it were ever so, and then some, as Jimmie says.""What's the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?"David inquired as the taxi
turned down the Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a hopeless
mesh of traffic.Gertrude answered, though she had not been the
one addressed at the moment.she
rattled on without waiting for an answer."I thought it was
good-looking myself, and Madam Paran robbed me for it.""It is good-looking," David allowed."It seems to be a kind of
retrieving hat, that's all.Keeps you in a rather constant state of
looking after the game."It's a lovely cross
between the style affected by the late Emperor Napoleon and my august
grandmother, with some frills added."The chauffeur turned into a cross street and stopped abruptly before
an imposing but apparently unguarded entrance."Why, I thought this was a studio building," Gertrude said."David, if
you're springing a tea party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I'll shoot the way my hat is pointing.""Straight through my left eye-glass," David finished."You wait till
you see the injustice you have done me."But Margaret, who often understood what was happening a few moments
before the revelation of it, clutched at his elbow.David, David," she whispered, "how wonderful!""Wait till you see," David said, and herded them into the elevator.David hurried them around
the bend in the sleekly carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to.It opened almost instantly and
David's man, who was French, stood bowing and smiling on the
threshold.Styvvisont has arrive'," he said; "he waits you.""Welcome to our city," Peter cried, appearing in the doorway of the
room Alphonse was indicating with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way."Jimmie's coming up from the
office and Beulah's due any minute.What do you think of the place,
girls?""It's really
ours, that's what it is.I've broken away from the mater at last," he
added a little sheepishly.I've got an
all-day desk job in my uncle's office and I'm going to dig in and see
what I can make of myself.Also, this is going to be our headquarters,
and Eleanor's permanent home if we're all agreed upon it,--but look
around, ladies.If you think I can interior
decorate, just tell me so frankly."It's like that old conundrum--black and white and red all over,"
Gertrude said."I never saw anything so stunning in all my life."I admire your nerve," Peter cried, "papering this place in
white, and then getting in all this heavy carved black stuff, and the
red in the tapestries and screens and pillows.""I wanted it to look studioish a little," David explained, "I wanted
to get away from Louis Quartorze.""And drawing-rooms like mother used to make," Gertrude suggested.Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian
or Chinese?The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous by its
absence.""I've got two portfolios full of 'em," David said, "and I always have
one or two up in the bedrooms.I change 'em around, you know, the way
the <DW61>s do themselves, a different scene every few days and the rest
decently out of sight till you're ready for 'em.""It's like a fairy story," Margaret said."I thought you'd appreciate what little Arabian Nights I was able to
introduce.I bought that screen," he indicated a sweep of Chinese line
and color, "with my eye on you, and that Aladdin's lamp is yours, of
course.You're to come in here and rub it whenever you like, and your
heart's desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you."Peter suggested, as David led the way through
the corridor and up the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment."This is her room, didn't you say, David?"He paused on the threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk."She once said that she wanted a yellow room," David said, "a
daffy-down-dilly room, and I've tried to get her one.I know last
year that Maggie Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor refused to be
comforted."A wild whoop in the below stairs announced Jimmie; and Beulah arrived
simultaneously with the tea tray.Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him."Headquarters is the one thing we've lacked," he said; "a place of our
own, hully gee!"You haven't been feeling altogether human lately, have you, Jimmie?""I'm a bad
egg," he explained to her darkly, "and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.""Scrambled is just about the way I should have described your behavior
of late,--but that's Gertrude's line," David said."Only she doesn't
seem to be taking an active part in the conversation.Aren't you
Jimmie's keeper any more, Gertrude?""Not since she's come back from abroad," Jimmie muttered without
looking at her."Eleanor's taken the job over now," Peter said."She's made him swear
off red ink and red neckties.""Any color so long's it's red is the color that suits me best," Jimmie
quoted."Lord, isn't this room a pippin?"He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a moment.It had been a
good many weeks since he had seen Gertrude."I want to give a suffrage tea here," Beulah broke in suddenly."It's
so central, but I don't suppose David would hear of it.""Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us--" Peter began."My _mother_ would hear of it," David said, "and then there wouldn't
be any little studio any more.She doesn't believe in votes for
women.""How any woman in this day and age--" Beulah began, and thought better
of it, since she was discussing Mrs."Makes your blood boil, doesn't it--Beulahland?"Gertrude suggested
helpfully, reaching for the tea cakes."Never mind, I'll vote for
women."The Lord helps those that help themselves," Peter said, "that's why
Gertrude is a suffragist.She believes in helping herself, in every
sense, don't you, 'Trude?""Not quite in every sense," Gertrude said gravely."Sometimes I feel
like that girl that Margaret describes as caught in a horrid way
between two generations."I'd rather be that way than early Victorian," Margaret sighed."Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody any objection to
having our child here for the holidays?""My idea is to
have one grand Christmas dinner.I suppose we'll all have to eat one
meal with our respective families, but can't we manage to get together
here for dinner at night?"We can't, but we will," Margaret murmured.I wanted her with me but the family thought otherwise.They've
been trying to send me away for my health, David."You'll stay in New York for your health and come
to my party.""Margaret's health is merely a matter of Margaret's happiness anyhow.Her soul and her body are all one," Gertrude said."Then cursed be he who brings anything but happiness to Margaret,"
Peter said, to which sentiment David added a solemn "Amen.""I wish you wouldn't," Margaret said, shivering a little, "I feel as
if some one were--were--"

"Trampling the violets on your grave," Gertrude finished for her.Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and Eleanor did not leave school
till the Friday before the great day.Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see her before the dinner
party itself.Even David was busy with his mother--installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her home until the opening
of the season at Palm Beach--and had only a few hurried words with
her.Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for the occasion, met her at
the station and helped her to do her modest shopping which consisted
chiefly of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles.She had arranged
these things lovingly at their plates, and fled to dress when they
began to assemble for the celebration.The girls were the first
arrivals."I had a few minutes' talk
with her over the telephone and she seemed to be flourishing.""She's grown several feet since we last saw
her.They've been giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and she's
been playing Juliet, it appears.She has had a fight with another girl
about suffrage--I don't know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me--and the other girl was
so unpleasant about it that she has been visited by just retribution
in the form of the mumps, and had to be sent home and quarantined.""Sounds a bit priggish," Peter suggested."Not really," David said, "she's as sound as a nut.She's only going
through the different stages.""To pass deliberately through one's ages," Beulah quoted, "is to get
the heart out of a liberal education.""Bravo, Beulah," Gertrude cried, "you're quite in your old form
to-night.""Is she just the same little girl, David?"I don't know why
she doesn't come down.No, it's only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie."Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived under the holiday
influence, was staggering under the weight of his parcels.The
Christmas presents had already accumulated to a considerable mound on
the couch.Margaret was brooding over them and trying not to look
greedy.She was still very much of a child herself in relation to
Santa Claus.My eyes--but you're a slick trio, girls.Pale
lavender, pale blue, and pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly
decollete.I don't know quite why
you do, but you do.""Give honor where honor is due, dearie.That's owing to the cleverness
of the decorator," David said."No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the tale," Jimmie remarked
almost dreamily as he squared off.But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.Alphonse
threw open the big entrance door at the farther end of the long room
with a flourish."Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet," he proclaimed with the grand air, and
then retired behind his hand, smiling broadly.Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and curls, softly rounding
bodice, and the long, straight lines of the Renaissance, stood
Juliet--Juliet, immemorial, immortal, young--austerely innocent and
delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet potential of all the beauty
and the wisdom of the world."I've never worn these clothes before anybody but the girls before,"
Eleanor said, "but I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you
might like it--for a surprise.""Great jumping Jehoshaphat," Jimmie exclaimed, "I thought you said she
was the same little girl, David.""She was half an hour ago," David answered, "I never saw such a
metamorphosis.In fact, I don't think I ever saw Juliet before.""She is the thing itself," Gertrude answered, the artist in her
sobered by the vision.But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes and stared at the delicate
figure advancing to him.she's a woman," he said, and drew the hard breath of a man
just awakened from sleep.[Illustration: "I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you might
like it--for a surprise"]




CHAPTER XV

GROWING UP


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"It was a pleasant surprise to get letters from every one of my uncles
the first week I got back to school.You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and Uncle Peter sixteen.He
is the best correspondent, but perhaps that is because I ask him the
most advice.I shall never forget the
expressions on all the different faces when I came down in my Juliet
suit.I thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I guess they
did."You know how well I liked my presents because you heard my wild
exclamations of delight.It was
sweet of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set, and to know that
every different piece was the loving thought of a different aunt or
uncle.It looks entirely unique, and I
like to have things that are not like anybody else's in the world,
don't you, Uncle Jimmie?They are
'neat,' but not 'gaudy.'You play golf so well I thought a golf stick
was a nice emblem for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer."I am glad you think it is easier to keep your pledge now.I made a
New Year's resolution to go without chocolates, and give the money
they would cost to some good cause, but it's hard to pick out a cause,
or to decide exactly how much money you are saving.I can eat the
chocolates that are sent to me, however!!!!"Uncle David said that he thought you were not like yourself lately,
but you seemed just the same to me Christmas, only more affectionate.I was really only joking about the chocolates.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle David:

"I was glad to get your nice letter.You did not have to write in
response to my bread and butter letter, but I am glad you did.When I
am at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as if I were
living two beautiful lives all at once, the life of a 'cooperative
child' and the life of Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together.Letters make the people you love seem very near to you, don't you
think they do?I sleep with all my letters under my pillow whenever I
feel the least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to breathe
sometimes.Maggie Lou had a wrist watch, too, for
Christmas, but not so pretty as the one you gave me.Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel like it.I don't know
whether that's a compliment or not.I took Kris Kringle for the
subject of a theme the other day, and represented him as caught in an
iceberg in the grim north, and not being able to reach all the poor
little children in the tenements and hovels.The Haddock said it
showed imagination."There was a lecture at school on Emerson the other day.The speaker
was a noted literary lecturer from New York.He had wonderful waving
hair, more like Pader--I can't spell him, but you know who I
mean--than Uncle Jimmie's, but a little like both.He introduced some
very noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly old ideas in
a new way that made you think a lot more of them.I think a tall man
like that with waving hair can do a great deal of good as a lecturer,
because you listen a good deal more respectfully than if they were
plain looking.His voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo's voice did.I had a nice letter from Madam Bolling.I love you,
and I have come to the bottom of the sheet.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle Peter:

"I have just written to my other uncles, so I won't write you a long
letter this time.They deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays.You always deserve letters, but not
specially now, any more than any other time."Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather.It seems funny to think of
Albertina's aunt taking care of him now that Grandma is gone.I
suppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for
Christmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I
used to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her
back when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,
Uncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on
her finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will
enclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It
isn't very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life

                 "Life is a great, a noble task,
                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,
                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where
                   Our dim pathway is leading,
                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,
                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,
                   Nor stop to question whither.E'en if we drink the bitter cup,
                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven't got the last verse very good yet, but I think the
second one is pretty.You know 'love-lies-bleeding' is a flower, but
it sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor's fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of
her life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve
exceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and
spontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and
play and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she
developed into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,
with a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor
herself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred
the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many
unhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the
inexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David's apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,
though the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by
herself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her
grandfather, now in charge of Albertina's aunt.She found Albertina
grown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who
plied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles
of New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of
that vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often
carries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken
care of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had
never done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility
of this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been
warmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her
simplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her
adoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the
expense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked
back incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a
state of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little
else that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden
sass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the
straggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,
helping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment
that she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again
whenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret
Louise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most
significant event of the entire year took place, though it was a
happening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never
thought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of
a moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he
had asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don't want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey
a sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom
she was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don't know you well
enough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that
hung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don't know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the
amenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You're an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the
chair from which she had half arisen."I don't believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words
would not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the
arrival of some member of the family.The boy's face was close to
hers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he
would talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there's no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches
in it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don't be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I'm not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you
hadn't, that's all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,
with an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between
herself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys
with mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and
colorless.Beulah's militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her
new interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first
delicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager
under her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and
hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to
get any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was
quite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that
dreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and
learned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of
apprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had
that year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor
of the romance languages and the other from a young society man,
already losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred
by the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the
dawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow
of celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had
seemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of
men, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York
business life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a
financier to his mother's surprise and amazement; and the pressure
relaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,
two mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling's list as suitable
parents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him
adroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,
modern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,
suffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges
of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in
reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those
with whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his
own woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself
as a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times
with a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired
earth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be
the vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an
amusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the
early death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him
for a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the
little girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a
woman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms
around him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child
beating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of
parenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected
by the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation
to their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual
concept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped
blindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both
understood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers
met and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering
unction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and
women, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in
common, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by
side in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward
instead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the
curious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor
stooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their
unconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI

MARGARET LOUISA'S BIRTHRIGHT


"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and
I have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never
wanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and
pain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long
years, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that
Bertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking
me.I don't like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do
little things for her that would win back her affection, but with no
success.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as
she called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,
which she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the
plague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I
always talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie's
character.I've always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is
that she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer
laziness not do it.She gummed it
all up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn't give it back to me or
get me another, but the reason she wouldn't give it back to me was
because her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and
not fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That's
only one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was
_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,
because I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any
reason why I shouldn't.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has
been up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so
spoony.He isn't as spoony as Margaret Louise's brother, but he's
quite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise
that I didn't like Stevie's brother, and then I made the damaging
remark that one reason I didn't like him was because he looked so much
like Stevie.I didn't bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her
Maggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I
thought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a
snow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is
a snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his
name is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a
good idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too
many dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don't mean
to use slang in my diary, but I can't seem to help it.Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in
replenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that'many
are called, and few are chosen,' and there is no need to try to
accommodate them all in one's vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how
he tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the
girls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I
told her everything else in the world that happened to come into my
head."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior
year, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with
things just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had
this queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I'd just go
around and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one
day when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found
out that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every
living thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only
without the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,
and when she was through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to
gaze into Stevie's overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as
I could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever
spent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her 'nothing
extenuate, and naught set down in malice,' and what I had said about
her to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of
either of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things
that she said she didn't think she would ever forget that I had said
about her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike
of her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the
bitterness to know that I wasn't really her enemy.She said that my
coming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of
character, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret
Louise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had
done.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that
upsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the
evidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that
in a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the
trouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you are to expect a
betrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a
clear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_
what you know."I won't even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret
Louise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she
argued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I
tried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in
a way that was dreadful.I've seen her do something like it before
about different things, and I ought to have known then what she was
like inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such
a scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, 'Margaret Louise, if that's all you've got to say
about the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us
from this minute;' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I
thought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don't
know whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or
not; I don't quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I
had a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very
strange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural
somehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent
with them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your
beautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, 'What Life Means to
Me,' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the
girls, but I've been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in
just so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would
transcribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my
grandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the
world,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of
my aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to
be without.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she
would never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as
if he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts
feel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that
way about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and
feel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel
that way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am
certain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there
is only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be
Uncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of
pottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live
in forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII

A REAL KISS


At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year
of preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart
that she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher
education should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in
all its bearings."If she doesn't decide in favor of college," David said, "and she
makes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't
see what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet
eligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at
his apartment."You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten
me sometimes.""You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of
eligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don't want her to be
married.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her
up quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her
off there won't be any comfort in having her.""I don't know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,
too.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the
most interesting games in the world.""That's not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like
things very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that
except for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very
little about you, Margaret.""There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.""That's a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems
to be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a
field of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,
don't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's
very improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and
your ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don't go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll
send out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I'm a little bit tired of being
one, that's all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and
cryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my
hearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting
her gloves to her fingers."I don't know exactly what it was I saw,
but it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the
creeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I
have a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of
Frankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's
going to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I
wouldn't say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of
owning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,
had his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something
very precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift
had been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more
silent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he
was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if
she had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights
of stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted
to hear your voice speaking.""If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you
ought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is
that the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,
while a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more
carefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when
he called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone
again died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she
wished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in
the most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an
obsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden
gasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of
the increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming
the airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in
the trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea
that she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already
grown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,
into his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you
looked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her
skirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to
speak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the
waiting motor."It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't
notice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally
unobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your
being a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been
rather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of
triviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has
grown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?"He's all the time wanting me to get you to
New York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller
than you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You
know she's on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her
room, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like
a heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you
added jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I'm not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it's only because
she's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.""It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody
should ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like
the famous primrose on the river's brim.""'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and
nothing more,'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off
suddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the
river's brim?""I don't know, I'm sure.I'm a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your
Aunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look
unlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with
youth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned
saucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,
but aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party
types, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,
with her hair in a braid."She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind
of middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of
the same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's
growing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She's theory ridden and fad bitten.She'll come to a bad end if
something doesn't stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle
David.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the
way she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your
rights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off
key, that's all.Your poor old
cooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other
place does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly
upon her.I didn't know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a
woman--"

Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound
box of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the
moment."What's devouring you, papa?""Don't I always place
tributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It's only
the labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should
go to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing
the family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long
visits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at
suffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the
shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently
with David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his
after-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I'd love it,--if--"

"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I'm going to earn my own living, you know."I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents
have accustomed you?""I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting
you do things for me forever."It doesn't seem--right, that's all.""It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious
varieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you
to do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better
fitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real
college."I can't think,--I'm stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my
mind."Eleanor, we're all
able to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided
among six of us.When did you come to
this extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.I told Uncle
Peter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I
want you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe
the best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there
would be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't
know.""You're an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how
extraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I
don't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you
do want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a
pursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own
living.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If
you're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on
it immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held
high.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and
the tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had
refrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out
his hand to her."There is only one way
for a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in
her eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A
hot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn't get such
things confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or
until you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,
but if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,
you are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have
something to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"

David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII

BEULAH'S PROBLEM


Peter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner
party for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After
that they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from
there to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that
were forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade
the two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as
a usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the
plea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's
feelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his
shaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the
room across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to
himself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo
interspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather
uncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.""My last girl--" and
began at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from
Vassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of
the higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her
that he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She's off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It's not exactly that
there's nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but
there's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's
got nothing else in her head."It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her," David explained."It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to
pieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking
into shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn't the answer to
Beulah's problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack
married a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,
temperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She
got going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her
at a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of
man's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're
thinking now of taking her to the--"

"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed
nothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven't
realized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I
am.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle
her some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself
seriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry
about," Peter persisted."Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's
got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its
most virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She's batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you'll see what we mean,
then.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his
face, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he
had an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to
see Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to
his friend.He had always felt that he saw
a little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the
energy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him
something alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her
soundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to
David."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see
Beulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to
try out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that
it's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell
the truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the
receiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the
ladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the
thin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of
his effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and
found him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided
that Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was
unthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid
vitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see
her."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and
tell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be
stopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I
never felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and
I think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world
they don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,
if I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,
what business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls
and bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if
my soul and body suffer?Peter
observed the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her
lips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don't think it was the original
intention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything
we are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can
understand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally
that and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long
enough--"

"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to
it.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to
get a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he
added aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she
conceded, "you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted
for so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and
I admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your
battle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you
personally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign
that's practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,
Peter,--"

"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are
concerned with.I know how much better church and state always have
been and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they
throw their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and
well for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and
Jimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her
state of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as
usual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical
incoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and
nobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren't we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right
to treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women
who are already in the proud possession of their rights and
privileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to
your theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in
two shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will
really begin," Beulah answered wearily."It's the habit of wearing the
yoke we'll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can't you give
yourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to
steady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but
nobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or
my failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,
that's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how
many people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't
believe in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position
of women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not
going to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like
so much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,
"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.""I shan't need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she'd stand
beside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and
have a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such
a child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?"I made a vow once that I would never
marry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there
are going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born
of the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn't make any difference why
you believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,
Peter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You
carry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my
way of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they're all wrong in
their treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a
less antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more
successful--"and I will.""You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or
who ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't
seem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's
necessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,
every one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and
opposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"
Peter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult
than he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and
substance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and
discounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the
interest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
the cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for
the struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of
balanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming
ourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health
and morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming
helpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously
responsible for Beulah's condition."She wouldn't have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had
been on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer
straighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be
stopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the
subject of equal guardianship,--and--"

Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the
depths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been
tensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You're the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they
stop me, I'll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don't cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You're too tired
to think things out now,--but I'll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of
the dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the
resemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when
she was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought
it all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it's wonderful that
you do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,
Beulah."Her arms closed around his neck and
tightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost
asleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his
tenderness."I didn't know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It
is the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not
sharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and
yellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung
in two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was
bent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her
confession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man
who had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX

MOSTLY UNCLE PETER


"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and
lonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole
year of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking
instead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone
any longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing
that it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much
troubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way
that it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have
grown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a
new woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that
you're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once
and for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and
never has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are
not hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be
married, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to
anybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and
you in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,
Uncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't
know.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written
you this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't
know quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by
when the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until
that happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find
some way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know
how to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not
belong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but
I don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it
already.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks
there is something different about her, but I think there are ways in
which I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly
what it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only
that, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I
think and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a
woman's soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,
is a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in
my life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I
think of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I
don't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing
it.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out
of this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up
troubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were
here to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the
gate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower
room all alone.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope
to Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven't any real right to
tell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without
saying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had
made her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet
spell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome
caress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She
understood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,
but that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle
David.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange
incredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her
lips."It's--it's--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from
somebody--else.Somebody that would make it
seem right."She felt that she
must get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any
man.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate
the way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand
"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the
realities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to
it--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had
bestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity
of her economic position; now that the complication of her relation
with David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly
uncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration
frightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or
troubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and
almost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow
accustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation
following the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but
David relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving
her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with
Mademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five
of her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,
she soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and
normal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and
when she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the
matter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the
group.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with
them.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting
for her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she
looked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very
newly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she
was soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *

"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good
many new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs
as if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and
teases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a
studio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle
Jimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking
into the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him
when we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at
me, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in
my school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we've dined at Sherry's, and one night we went down
to the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to
_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget
that night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing
me about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never
seem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about
taking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must
have telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he
would, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time
talks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very
little better than not seeing him at all.He isn't like himself,
someway.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand."*       *       *       *       *

"Don't you think that Uncle Peter has changed?"she asked Jimmie,
when the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand."He is a little pale about the ears," Jimmie conceded, "but I think
that's the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all
his spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and
getting out on his horse the way he used to.He's doing a good job on
the old dear, but it's some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--"

"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?"Eleanor's lips were dry,
but she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed
strange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs
that made her very heart stand still."I didn't know that Uncle Peter
had been taking care of her.""Taking care of her isn't a circumstance to what Peter has been doing
for Beulah.You know she hasn't been right for some time.She got
burning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when
there was air in it.""Uncle David thought so the last time I was here," Eleanor said, "but
I didn't know that Uncle Peter--"

"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got
alarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that
Doctor Gramercy was called.If we'd believed he would go into it quite
so heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It's
very nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when
the lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah's
got suffrage mania, and Peter's got Beulah mania, and it's a merry
mess all around."You haven't seen much of him since you came, have
you?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get
away from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked 'Votes for
Women,' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green
perambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks
to her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only
subject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo
gently under it day by day.It's a very complicated process but he's
making headway.""I'm glad of that," Eleanor said faintly."How--how is Aunt Gertrude?I don't see her very often, either."It was Jimmie's turn to look self-conscious."She never has time for me any more; I'm not high-brow enough for her.She's getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere."She gave me a cast of her faun's head."She is, I guess, but don't let's waste all our valuable time talking
about the family.Let's talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I'm
feeling and then I'll tell you.Then I'll ask you how you're feeling
and you'll tell me.Then I'll tell you how I imagine you must be
feeling from the way you're looking,--and that will give me a chance
to expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I'll work up
delicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably
with all the other nice young men you know,--and then we'll be off."Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little."We shall indeed," he assured her solemnly.No, on second
thoughts, I'll begin.I'll begin at the place where I start telling
you how excessively well you're looking.I don't know, considering its
source, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest
blue eyes that I've, ever seen in all my life,--and I'm rather a judge
of them.""All the better to eat you with, my dear," Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows."I don't feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a
funny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn't
it?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn't blither to the very
babe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?""I'm not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says
that you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering
things out of your previous experience.""'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?'"Only I'd prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if
it's all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, 'yet
not for a--' something or other 'would I wish undone that deed beyond
the grave.'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could
understand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let's get out
into the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this
afternoon.I wish you hadn't grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my
breath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath
taken away so suddint like.Let's get out into the rolling prairie of
Central Park."But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that
peculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The
children, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks
later would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless
between seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive
balminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating
chilliness."I'm sorry I'm not more entertaining this afternoon," Jimmie
apologized on the way home."It isn't that I am not happy, or that I
don't feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I'm
silent upon a peak in Darien,--that's all.""I was thinking of something else, too," Eleanor said."I didn't say I was thinking of something else.""People are always thinking of something else when they aren't talking
to each other, aren't they?""Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn't thinking of
something else, I was thinking--well, I won't tell you exactly--at
present."A penny is a good deal of money."I'm afraid I couldn't--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle
Jimmie."My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other
hand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.""I'm afraid they wouldn't be worth anything to anybody.""You simply don't know what I am capable of making out of them.""I wish I could make something out of them," Eleanor said so
miserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her
out, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *

"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt
Beulah," she wrote in her diary that evening."It is beautiful of him
to try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just
like him, but I don't understand why it is that he doesn't come and
tell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to
know that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even
in helping her.It isn't like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and
nurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might
think that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on
my heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn't it occur to him that I might have something to
tell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to
keep in form.If he doesn't have a certain amount of muscular
activity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases
between his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked
him the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head
ached, and he said 'no,' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost
all the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter
is trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to
him, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody
in the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter."I suppose it's a part of his great beauty that he should think so
disparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just
how dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn't so much what
he says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,
it's the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn't think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn't know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon
somebody who isn't as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it
makes me wild to think of it.My
vacation is almost over, and I don't see how I could bear going back
to school without one comforting hour of him alone."I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about
Uncle Peter!"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are
going to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to
try to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won't give
me the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can't
have, and things you can have and don't want.It seems almost disloyal
to put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love
him, but oh!--not in that way.There is only one
person in a woman's life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn't my Uncle Peter come to me?"CHAPTER XX

THE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING


"Just by way of formality," David said, "and not because I think any
one present"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner
table--"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be
released from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years
ago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I
do wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission
granted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do
so."Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine
confusion that it raised a shout of laughter."I never signed any pledge to that effect.""We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital
celibate anyway," Jimmie answered."Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me," Peter
said with a covert glance at Beulah."I wish I could say as much," Jimmie sighed, "since this is the hour
of confession I don't mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon."Gertrude clapped her hands softly."We've the makings of a triple
wedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear
the voice that breathed o'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the
most exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to
the health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one
slipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret's sudden pallor and heard the convulsive
catching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,
pale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the
shadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own
salvation."On behalf of my coadjutors," he said, "I thank you.All this is
extremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the
other gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully
into my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is
that I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of
abstinence.You fellows say something," he concluded,
sinking abruptly into his chair."Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian," Jimmie murmured."I've got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say
and that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I'll
create a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link
her name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our
leading journals, you'll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to
create with my modest announcement.I've got a real romance up my
sleeve."There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.""The lady won't give me her permission to speak," Peter said."She
knows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.""It is better we should marry," she said."I didn't realize that when
I exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that
the brains to carry on the great work of the world must be
inherited."I'll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider
ourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as
a further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.""Eleanor will be surprised, won't she?"Three
self-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation."_Eleanor_," Margaret breathed, "_Eleanor_.""I rather think she will," Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David
said nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still
twirling on its stem."Eleanor will be taken care of just the same," Beulah said decisively."I don't think we need even go through the formality of a vote on
that.""Eleanor will be taken care of," David said softly.The Hutchinsons' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor
nowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other
girls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were
disappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude
respectively under their accustomed protection."I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude," Jimmie said reproachfully as she
slipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm."I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret," David said;
"you never gave me the slip before.""The old order changeth," Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as
she preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior."It's Eleanor," Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth
Avenue."Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn't you
see their faces when Beulah spoke of her?""David wants to marry Eleanor," Margaret said quietly."I've known it
all winter--without realizing what it was I knew.""Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?""Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?"it doesn't make any difference,--we're losing them just the same.""No matter what combinations come
about, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.""Indestructible friendship--shucks," Gertrude cried."The boys are
going to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that
indestructible friendships don't survive--except as ghosts.""It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor," Margaret said."It's Peter who has always loved her best."As a friend," Beulah said, "as her dearest friend.""Not as a friend," Margaret answered softly, "she loves him."I believe it," Gertrude said.Of
course, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.""If it isn't we've succeeded in working out a rather tragic
experiment," Margaret said, "haven't we?""Life is a tragic experiment for any woman," Gertrude said
sententiously."Peter doesn't intend to marry Eleanor," Beulah persisted."Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?""Yes, I do know, but I--I can't tell you yet.""Whoever it is, it's a mistake," Margaret said."It's our little
Eleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn't realize it himself yet, and
when he does it will be too late.He's probably gone and tied himself
up with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn't he, Beulah?""I don't know," Beulah said; "perhaps he has.I hadn't thought of it
that way.""It's the way to think of it, I know."Margaret's eyes filled with
sudden tears."But whatever he's done it's past mending now.There'll
be no question of Peter's backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and
our poor little kiddie's got to suffer.""Beulah took it hard," Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town
again after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were
spending the night together at Margaret's.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically
responsible for her.I can't pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are
our boys going to marry?""I don't know, Gertrude.""I always thought that you and David--"

Margaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit
question."I always thought that you and Jimmie--" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him."it's all over now," Gertrude said, "but I didn't know that a
living soul suspected me."Gertrude whispered as they clung to each
other.I've never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so
used to him.""That's the rub," Gertrude said, "we're so used to them.They're
so--so preposterously necessary to us."Late that night clasped in each other's arms they admitted the extent
of their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The
solid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the
background of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,
so many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of
their circle was an unthinkable calamity."We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,"
Gertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly
turned in the right direction instead of being given their heads."I wouldn't pay that price for love," Margaret said.By
the time I had made it happen I wouldn't want it.""That's my trouble too," Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her
pillow and sobbed helplessly."Jimmie had such ducky little curls,"
she explained incoherently."I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude's breath began
to rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the
darkness.CHAPTER XXI

ELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in
which to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got
to write.In the first place I can't believe that the things you said
to me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of
realities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that
you were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes
the woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same
way.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can't help
feeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you
said this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely
ways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream
things that we wouldn't even understand if we were thoroughly awake."In the second place, you can't want to marry your little niecelet,
the funny little 'kiddo,' that used to burn her fingers and the
beefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of
make-believe together.That's what our association always ought to
mean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn't think of myself being married to you any more than I could
Jack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.You're my truly best and
dearest childhood's playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle
Jimmie.I don't think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless
she has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn't want to
marry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of
playmates that can't marry each other.I think that you and I are that
kind, Uncle Jimmie."My dear, my dear, don't let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when
I am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped
support and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so
much,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this
distorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong
enough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find
the way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are
feeling now is not real.I can't tell you how I know, but I do know
the difference.They could be pulled up
without too terrible a havoc."Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a
hard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor
inkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny
little Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope
you will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other
lumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth
considering except as a kind of human joke."Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *

It was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret
spending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which
Eleanor's school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her
overnight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the
entire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her
for the revelations that were in store for her, though she was
ostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into
the Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in
the low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road
house, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new
sporting clothes."Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married," she
told her."No, I didn't," Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very
white.David gave a dinner party one night last
week in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don't know
the name of the lady yet, and we can't guess it.He says it is not a
society girl.""Who do you think it is, Eleanor?""I--I can't think, Aunt Margaret.""We don't know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely
insinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we
knew.""Perhaps he has changed his mind by now," Eleanor said.Don't you think it might be that they both just
thought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to
marry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don't think it's a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had
anticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the
sensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to
tell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from
the pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have
been shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were
connecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity
nightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in
Margaret's memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell
her in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not
so perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely
thing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now
that I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my
feelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people
I've grown, Eleanor?""You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're
very much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything
about Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant."I haven't heard from him for a
long time.""Yes, he's well," Margaret said."He's looking better than he was for
a while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He
said that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It's Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of
her.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don't think it's Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,
but I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if
she hadn't been.""Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn't know that," she said.She
pushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don't touch me," she cried, "I can't bear it.You might not want
to--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw
her head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *

The next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in
the night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from
the room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of
exhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk
said, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to
do things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that
some people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,
and I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to
tell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found
to be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such
beautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each
other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little
blinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt
Margaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go
wrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be
that kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one
else know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,
don't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange
it so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me
naturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the
river, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be
any use in trying to find me.I couldn't
ever bear seeing one of your faces again.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him
to know,--I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I
have taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII

THE SEARCH


Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,
but the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him
and told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a
lank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his
attitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure
made Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to
proceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the
school, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a
somewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a
promise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not
keep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the
others.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor
had left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,
they faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was
hurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"
Margaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her
going.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to
marry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,"
David said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I
told her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think
that she's probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of
judgment, Margaret?I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to
either one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that
same afternoon at Beulah's apartment."I'll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting
explanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done
their best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he
only said, "I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we
try we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it's going to be so easy?"She's a pretty determined little person when she
makes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously."I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world," Peter said."I'll find
her and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she
went away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else
on her mind, hadn't she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but
she had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we
haven't told any one."It's
just one of God's most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don't believe in shifting
responsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been
instrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her
to my own happiness.""It isn't so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start
going soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has
been directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for
that matter.""Don't worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the
other corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You
mustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but
we'll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you'll get her
back again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *

Peter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding
out the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly
to her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine
office, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt
almost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the defraying of her college
expenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even
though she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this
theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

                  *       *       *       *       *

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.Sandra went to the kitchen.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.He was much opposed to your
father's going into the ministry, he wanted him to go into business
with him.He is a strong-willed man, and does not easily relinquish
any plan of his own making.It went hard with him, when your father
refused to yield; later, when your father received the call to this
parish, your uncle quite as strongly opposed his accepting it--burying
himself alive in a little out-of-the-way hole, he called it.It came
to the point, finally, on your uncle's insisting on his making it a
choice between himself and Winton.He refused to ever come near the
place and the two or three letters your father wrote at first remained
unanswered.The breach between them has been one of the hardest trials
your father has had to bear.""Oh," Pauline cried miserably, "what a horrid interfering thing father
must think me!Rushing in where I had no right to!I wish I'd
known--I just thought--you see, father speaks of Uncle Paul now and
then--that maybe they'd only--grown apart--and that if Uncle Paul knew!It would serve me right; and yet,
if it does, I'm afraid I can't help feeling somewhat disappointed--on
Hilary's account."I would rather you said
nothing of what I have been telling you to either Hilary or Patience,
Pauline."It seems I have a lot of secrets from Hilary.And I won't write any more such letters without consulting you or
father, you can depend on that."Paul Shaw's answer did not come within the allotted week.It was
the longest week Pauline had ever known; and when the second went by
and still no word from her uncle, the waiting and uncertainty became
very hard to bear, all the harder, that her usual confidant, Hilary,
must not be allowed to suspect anything.The weather had turned suddenly warm, and Hilary's listlessness had
increased proportionately, which probably accounted for the dying out
of what little interest she had felt at first in Patience's "mysterious
letter."Patience, herself, was doing her best to play fair; fortunately, she
was in school the greater part of the day, else the strain upon her
powers of self-control might have proved too heavy."Mother," Pauline said one evening, lingering in her mother's room,
after Hilary had gone to bed, "I don't believe Uncle Paul means
answering at all.I wish I'd never asked him to do anything."Still it is rather early yet for you to give up
hope.It's hard waiting, I know, dear, but that is something we all
have to learn to do, sooner or later.""I don't think 'no news is good news,'" Pauline said; then she
brightened.Suppose the letter is on the way now,
and that Hilary is to have a sea voyage!"Pauline, Pauline, not so fast!Listen, dear, we might send Hilary out
to The Maples for a week or two.Boyd would be delighted to have
her; and it wouldn't be too far away, in case we should be getting her
ready for that--sea voyage.""I don't believe she'd care to go; it's quieter than here at home."I believe I'll suggest it to her in the
morning."Shaw did suggest it the next morning, Hilary was quite of
Pauline's opinion."I shouldn't like it a bit, mother!It would be
worse than home--duller, I mean; and Mrs.Boyd would fuss over me so,"
she said impatiently."You used to like going there, Hilary.""Mother, you can't want me to go.""I think it might do you good, Hilary."Please, mother, I don't see the use of bothering with little half-way
things.""I do, Hilary, when they are the only ones within reach."The girl moved restlessly, settling her hammock cushions; then she lay
looking out over the sunny garden with discontented eyes.It was a large old-fashioned garden, separated on the further side by a
low hedge from the old ivy-covered church.On the back steps of the
church, Sextoness Jane was shaking out her duster.She was old and
gray and insignificant looking; her duties as sexton, in which she had
succeeded her father, were her great delight.The will with which she
sang and worked now seemed to have in it something of reproach for the
girl stretched out idly in the hammock.Nothing more than half-way
things, and not too many of those, had ever come Sextoness Jane's way.Hilary moved impatiently, turning her back on the garden and the bent
old figure moving about in the church beyond; but, somehow, she
couldn't turn her back on what that bent old figure had suddenly come
to stand for.Fifteen minutes later, she sat up, pushing herself slowly back and
forth."I wish Jane had chosen any other morning to clean the church
in, Mother Shaw!""Couldn't she do it, I wonder, on an irregular day!Anyhow, if she
had, I shouldn't have to go to The Maples this afternoon.But what has Jane to do with your going?""No, indeed, dear; and you are not to go at all, unless you can do it
willingly.""Oh, I'm fairly resigned; don't press me too hard, Mother Shaw.I
think I'll go tell Paul now.""Well," Pauline said, "I'm glad you've decided to go, Hilary.I--that
is, maybe it won't be for very long."CHAPTER II

THE MAPLES

That afternoon Pauline drove Hilary out to the big, busy, pleasant
farm, called The Maples.As they jogged slowly down the one principal street of the sleepy, old
town, Pauline tried to imagine that presently they would turn off down
the by-road, leading to the station.Through the still air came the
sound of the afternoon train, panting and puffing to be off with as
much importance as the big train, which later, it would connect with
down at the junction."Paul," Hilary asked suddenly, "what are you thinking about?"Pauline slapped the reins lightly across old Fanny's plump sides."Oh,
different things--traveling for one."Suppose Uncle Paul's letter
should come in this afternoon's mail!That she would find it waiting
for her when she got home!"I was wishing that you and I were going off
on that train, Paul."After all, it couldn't do any harm--Hilary
would think it one of their "pretend" talks, and it would he nice to
have some definite basis to build on later."I would like to go to the seashore
somewhere; but most anywhere, where there were people and interesting
things to do and see, would do.""There's Josie," Hilary said, and her sister drew rein, as a girl came
to the edge of the walk to speak to them.she asked, catching sight of the valise."Only out to the Boyds'," Pauline told her, "to leave Hilary."Josie shifted the strap of school-books under her arm impatiently."Well, I just wish I was going, too; it's a
deal pleasanter out there, than in a stuffy school room these days.""It's stupid--and you both know it," Hilary protested.She glanced
enviously at Josie's strap of hooks."And when school closes, you'll
be through for good, Josie Brice.We shan't finish together, after
all, now.""Oh, I'm not through yet," Josie assured her."Father'll be going out
past The Maples Saturday morning, I'll get him to take me along.""Don't forget," she urged, and as she and Pauline
drove on, she added, "I suppose I can stick it out for a week."_Will_ you go on, Fanny!"Pauline
slapped the dignified, complacent Fanny with rather more severity than
before."She's one great mass of laziness," she declared."Father's
spoiled her a great deal more than he ever has any of us."It was a three-mile drive from the village to The Maples, through
pleasant winding roads, hardly deserving of a more important title than
lane.Now and then, from the top of a low hill, they caught a glimpse
of the great lake beyond, shining in the afternoon sunlight, a little
ruffled by the light breeze sweeping down to it from the mountains
bordering it on the further side.Hilary leaned back in the wide shaded gig; she looked tired, and yet
the new touch of color in her cheeks was not altogether due to
weariness."The ride's done you good," Pauline said."I wonder what there'll be for supper," Hilary remarked."If you promise to eat a good one."It was comforting to have Hilary
actually wondering what they would have.They had reached the broad avenue of maples leading from the road up to
the house.It was a long, low, weather-stained house, breathing an
unmistakable air of generous and warm-hearted hospitality.Pauline
never came to it, without a sense of pity for the kindly elderly
couple, who were so fond of young folks, and who had none of their own.Boyd had seen them coming, and she came out to meet them, as they
turned into the dooryard.And an old dog, sunning himself on the
doorstep, rose with a slow wag of welcome."Mother's sent you something she was sure you would like to have,"
Pauline said."Please, will you take in a visitor for a few days?"she
added, laying a hand on Hilary's."You've brought Hilary out to stop?""Now
I call that mighty good of your mother.You come right 'long in, both
of you: you're sure you can't stop, too, Pauline?"Boyd had the big valise out from under the seat by now."Come
right 'long in," she repeated."You're tired, aren't you, Hilary?But
a good night's rest'll set you up wonderful.Take her into the spare
room, Pauline.Dear me, I must have felt you was coming, seeing that I
aired it out beautiful only this morning.Boyd to
take Fanny to the barn."Pauline declared, as she and Hilary went
indoors.The spare room was back of the parlor, a large comfortable room, with
broad windows facing south and west, and a small vine-covered porch all
its own on the south side of the room.Pauline pulled forward a great chintz-cushioned rocker, putting her
sister into it, and opened the porch door.Beyond lay a wide, sloping
meadow and beyond the meadow, the lake sparkled and rippled in the
sunshine."If you're not contented here, Hilary Shaw!"Pauline said, standing in
the low doorway."Suppose you pretend you've never been here before!I reckon you'd travel a long ways to find a nicer place to stay in.""I shouldn't doubt it if you were going to stay with me, Paul; I know
I'm going to be homesick."Pauline stretched out a hand to Captain, the old dog, who had come
around to pay his compliments.Captain liked visitors--when he was
convinced that they really were visitors, not peddlers, nor agents,
quite as well as his master and mistress did."You'd be homesick
enough, if you really were off on your travels--you'd better get used
to it.Pauline went to unpack the valise,
opening the drawers of the old-fashioned mahogany bureau with a little
breath of pleasure.Hilary smiled, catching some of her sister's enthusiasm.She leaned
back among her cushions, her eyes on the stretch of shining water at
the far end of the pasture."I wish you were going to be here, Paul,
so that we could go rowing.I wonder if I'll ever feel as if I could
row again, myself.""Of course you will, and a great deal sooner than you think."Pauline
hung Hilary's dressing-gown across the foot of the high double bed."Now I think you're all settled, ma'am, and I hope to your
satisfaction.Isn't it a veritable 'chamber of peace,' Hilary?"Through the open door and windows came the distant tinkle of a cow
bell, and other farm sounds.There came, too, the scent of the early
May pinks growing in the borders of Mrs.Boyd's old-fashioned flower
beds.Already the peace and quiet of the house, the homely comfort,
had done Hilary good; the thought of the long simple days to come, were
not so depressing as they had seemed when thought of that morning."Bless me, I'd forgotten, but I've a bit of news for you," Mrs.Boyd
said, coming in, a moment or so later; "the manor's taken for the
summer."Pauline cried, "why it's been empty for ever and ever so
long."The manor was an old rambling stone house, standing a little back from
a bit of sandy beach, that jutted out into the lake about a mile from
The Maples.It was a pleasant place, with a tiny grove of its own, and
good-sized garden, which, year after year, in spite of neglect, was
bright with old-fashioned hardy annuals planted long ago, when the
manor had been something more than an old neglected house, at the mercy
of a chance tenant.They've got old Betsy Todd to look after
them," Mrs."The girl's about your age, Hilary.You
wasn't looking to find company of that sort so near, was you?""But, after all, the
manor's a mile away.""Oh, she's back and forth every day--for milk, or one thing or another;
she's terribly interested in the farm; father's taken a great notion to
her.She'll be over after supper, you'll see; and then I'll make you
acquainted with her."From her air one would
have supposed she had planned the whole affair expressly for Hilary's
benefit."Shirley; it's a queer name for a girl, to my thinking.""Not according to my notions; father says she is.She's thin and dark,
and I never did see such a mane of hair--and it ain't always too tidy,
neither--but she has got nice eyes and a nice friendly way of talking.Looks to me, like she hasn't been brought up by a woman.""She sounds--interesting," Pauline said, and when Mrs.Boyd had left
them, to make a few changes in her supper arrangements, Pauline turned
eagerly to Hilary."You're in luck, Hilary Shaw!The newest kind of
new people; even if it isn't a new place!""How do you know they'll, or rather, she'll, want to know me?"Hilary
asked, with one of those sudden changes of mood an invalid often shows,
"or I her?Boyd
would mind letting me have supper in here?""Oh, Hilary, she's laid the table in the living-room!"Well," Hilary said, "come on then."Out in the living-room, they found Mr.Boyd waiting for them, and so
heartily glad to see them, that Hilary's momentary impatience vanished.To Pauline's delight, she really brought quite an appetite to her
supper."You should've come out here long ago, Hilary," Mr.Boyd told her, and
he insisted on her having a second helping of the creamed toast,
prepared especially in her honor.Captain's deep-toned bark proclaimed a
newcomer, or newcomers, seeing that it was answered immediately by a
medley of shrill barks, in the midst of which a girl's voice sounded
authoritively--"Quiet, Phil!Pudgey, if
you're not good instantly, you shall stay at home to-morrow night!"A moment later, the owner of the voice appeared at the porch door, "May
I come in, Mrs.I've a couple of young friends here, I
want you should get acquainted with," Mrs."You ain't had your supper yet, have you, Miss Shirley?""Father and I had tea out on the lake," Shirley answered, "but I'm
hungry enough again by now, for a slice of Mrs.And presently, she was seated at the table, chatting away with Paul and
Hilary, as if they were old acquaintances, asking Mr.Boyd various
questions about farm matters and answering Mrs.Boyd's questions
regarding Betsy Todd and her doings, with the most delightful air of
good comradeship imaginable.Pauline pushed hack her chair regretfully, "I simply must
go, it'll be dark before I get home, as it is.""I reckon it will, deary," Mrs.Boyd agreed, "so I won't urge you to
stay longer.Father, you just whistle to Colin to bring Fanny 'round."Hilary followed her sister into the bedroom."You'll be over soon,
Paul?"Pauline, putting on her hat before the glass, turned quickly.Hilary, don't you like her?"Hilary balanced herself on the arm of the big, old-fashioned rocker.Anyway, I love to watch her talk; she talks all over her
face."They went out to the gig, where Mr.Shirley was feeding Fanny with handfuls of fresh grass."Mayn't I give you a lift?I can go 'round by the manor road's well as not."Shirley accepted readily, settling herself in the gig, and balancing
her pail of milk on her knee carefully."Mind, you're to be ever and ever so much
better, next time I come, Hilary."Shirley asked, her voice full of
sympathetic interest."Not sick--exactly; just run down and listless."Shirley leaned a little forward, drawing in long breaths of the clear
evening air."I don't see how anyone can ever get run down--here, in
this air; I'm hardly indoors at all.Father and I have our meals out
on the porch.You ought to have seen Betsy Todd's face, the first time
I proposed it.'Ain't the dining-room to your liking, miss?'""Betsy Todd's a queer old thing," Pauline commented."Father has the
worst time, getting her to come to church.""We were there last Sunday," Shirley said."I'm afraid we were rather
late; it's a pretty old church, isn't it?I suppose you live in that
square white house next to it?""Father came to Winton just after he was
married, so we girls have never lived anywhere else nor been anywhere
else--that counted.We're dreadfully
tired of Winton--Hilary, especially."Fanny was making forward most reluctantly; the Boyd barn had been very
much to her liking.Now, as the three dogs made a swift rush at her
leaping and barking around her, she gave a snort of disgust, quickening
her pace involuntarily."She isn't in
the least scared, and it's perfectly refreshing to find that she can
move.""All the same, discipline must be maintained," Shirley insisted; and at
her command the dogs fell behind.We were going further up the lake--just on a
sketching trip,--and we saw this house from the deck of the boat; it
looked so delightful, and so deserted and lonely, that we came back
from the next landing to see about it.We took it at once and sent for
a lot of traps from the studio at home, they aren't here yet."It seemed a very odd, attractive way of
doing things, no long tiresome plannings of ways and means beforehand.Suppose--when Uncle Paul's letter came--they could set off in such
fashion, with no definite point in view, and stop wherever they felt
like it."I can't think," Shirley went on, "how such a charming old place came
to be standing idle."I want father to buy it, and do what is
needed to it, without making it all new and snug looking.The sunsets
from that front lawn are gorgeous, don't you think so?""Yes," Pauline agreed, "I haven't been over there in two years.We
used to have picnics near there.""I hope you will again, this summer, and invite father and me.We
adore picnics; we've had several since we came--he and I and the dogs.The dogs do love picnics so, too."Pauline had given up wanting to hurry Fanny; what a lot she would have
to tell her mother when she got home.She was sorry when a turn in the road brought them within sight of the
old manor house.Shirley said, nodding to a figure
coming towards them across a field.The dogs were off to meet him
directly, with shrill barks of pleasure."Thank you very much for
the lift; and I am so glad to have met you and your sister, Miss Shaw.You'll both come and see me soon, won't you?""We'd love to," Pauline answered heartily; "'cross lots, it's not so
very far over here from the parsonage, and," she hesitated,
"you--you'll be seeing Hilary quite often, while she's at The Maples,
perhaps?"Father's on the lookout for a horse and rig for me, and
then she and I can have some drives together.She will know where to
find the prettiest roads.""Oh, she would enjoy that," Pauline said eagerly, and as she drove on,
she turned more than once to glance back at the tall, slender figure
crossing the field.Shirley seemed to walk as if the mere act of
walking were in itself a pleasure.Pauline thought she had never
before known anyone who appeared so alive from head to foot.she commanded; she was in a hurry to get home now,
with her burden of news.It seemed to her as if she had been away a
long while, so much had happened in the meantime.At the parsonage gate, Pauline found Patience waiting for her."You
have taken your time, Paul Shaw!"the child said, climbing in beside
her sister."I went for the mail
myself this afternoon, so I know!""Oh, well, perhaps it will to-morrow," Pauline answered, with so little
of real concern in her voice, that Patience wondered."Suppose you
take Fanny on to the barn."You've got something--particular--to
tell mother!O Paul, please wait 'til I come.Is it about--"

"You're getting to look more like an interrogation point every day,
Impatience!"Pauline told her, getting down from the gig."If nobody ever asked questions, nobody'd ever know
anything!"Patience drew the reins up tightly and
bouncing up and down on the carriage seat, called sharply--"Hi yi!It was the one method that never failed to rouse Fanny's indignation,
producing, for the moment, the desired effect; still, as Pauline said,
it was hardly a proceeding that Hilary or she could adopt, or, least of
all, their father.As she trotted briskly off to the barn now, the very tilt of Fanny's
ears expressed injured dignity.Dignity was Fanny's strong point;
that, and the ability to cover less ground in an afternoon than any
other horse in Winton.The small human being at the other end of those
taut reins might have known she would have needed no urging barnwards."Maybe you don't like it," Patience observed, "but that makes no
difference--'s long's it's for your good.You're a very unchristiany
horse, Fanny Shaw.And I'll 'hi yi' you every time I get a chance; so
now go on."However Patience was indoors in time to hear all but the very beginning
of Pauline's story of her afternoon's experience."I told you," she
broke in, "that I saw a nice girl at church last Sunday--in Mrs.Dobson's pew; and Mrs.Dobson kept looking at her out of the corner of
her eyes all the tune,'stead of paying attention to what father was
saying; and Miranda says, ten to one.Sally Dobson comes out in--"

"That will do, Patience," her mother said, "if you are going to
interrupt in this fashion, you must run away."Patience subsided reluctantly, her blue eyes most expressive."Isn't it nice for Hilary, mother?Now she'll be contented to stay a
week or two, don't you think?""She was looking better already, mother; brighter, you know.""Mummy, is asking a perfectly necessary question 'interrupting'?'""Perhaps not, dear, if there is only one," smiled Mrs."Mayn't I, please, go with Paul and Hilary when they go to call on that
girl?"Patience wriggled impatiently; grown people were certainly very trying
at times."On Paul's and Hilary's new friend, mummy.""Not the first time, Patience; possibly later--"

Patience shrugged."By and by," she observed, addressing the room at
large, "when Paul and Hilary are married, I'll be Miss Shaw!And
then--" the thought appeared to give her considerable comfort."And maybe, Towser," she confided later, as the two sat together on the
side porch, "maybe--some day--you and I'll go to call on them on our
own account.I'm not sure it isn't your duty to call on those
dogs--you lived here first, and I can't see why it isn't mine--to call
on that girl.Father says, we should always hasten to welcome the
stranger; and they sound dreadfully interesting."In spite of his years, he still
followed blindly where Patience led, though the consequences were
frequently disastrous.It was the next afternoon that Pauline, reading in the garden, heard an
eager little voice calling excitedly, "Paul, where are you!Haven't I run every inch of the way home!"She waved the letter above
her head--"'Miss Pauline A.O Paul, aren't
you going to read it out here!"For Pauline, catching the letter from her, had run into the house,
crying--"Mother!CHAPTER III

UNCLE PAUL'S ANSWER

"Mother!Shaw's
answering from her own room, she ran on up-stairs."So I thought--when I heard Patience calling just now.Pauline, dear,
try not to be too disappointed if--"

"You open it, mother--please!Now it's really come, I'm--afraid to.""No, dear, it is addressed to you," Mrs.And Pauline, a good deal sobered by the gravity with which her mother
had received the news, sat down on the wide window seat, near her
mother's chair, tearing open the envelope.As she spread out the heavy
businesslike sheet of paper within, a small folded enclosure fell from
it into her lap.She had never
received a check from anyone before.and she read
aloud, "'Pay to the order of Miss Pauline A. Shaw, the sum of
twenty-five dollars.'"One ought to be able to do a good deal with
twenty-five dollars!She had followed her sister
up-stairs, after a discreet interval, curling herself up unobtrusively
in a big chair just inside the doorway."Can you do what you like with
it, Paul?"But Pauline was bending over the letter, a bright spot of color on each
cheek.Presently, she handed it to her mother."I wish--I'd never
written to him!Shaw read, as follows--


          NEW YORK CITY, May 31, 19--._Miss Pauline A. Shaw,
  Winton, Vt._

MY DEAR NIECE: Yours of May 16th to hand.I am sorry to learn that
your sister Hilary appears to be in such poor health at present.Such
being the case, however, it would seem to me that home was the best
place for her.I do not at all approve of this modern fashion of
running about the country, on any and every pretext.Also, if I
remember correctly, your father has frequently described Winton to me
as a place of great natural charms, and peculiarly adapted to those
suffering from so-called nervous disorders.Altogether, I do not feel inclined to comply with your request to make
it possible for your sister to leave home, in search of change and
recreation.Instead, beginning with this letter, I will forward you
each month during the summer, the sum of twenty-five dollars, to be
used in procuring for your sisters and yourself--I understand, there is
a third child--such simple and healthful diversions as your parents may
approve, the only conditions I make, being, that at no time shall any
of your pleasure trips take you further than ten miles from home, and
that you keep me informed, from time to time, how this plan of mine is
succeeding.Trusting this may prove satisfactory,

    Very respectfully,
        PAUL A. SHAW."Isn't it a very--queer sort of letter?""It is an extremely characteristic one, dear.""I think," Patience could contain herself no longer, "that you are the
inconsideratest persons!You know I'm perfectly wild to know what's in
that letter!""Run away now, Patience," her mother said."You shall hear about it
later," and when Patience had obeyed--not very willingly, Mrs."We must show this to your father, before
making any plans in regard to it, dear."You show it to him, please, mother."When her mother had gone down-stairs, Pauline still sat there in the
window seat, looking soberly out across the lawn to the village street,
with its double rows of tall, old trees.So her flag had served little
purpose after all!That change for Hilary was still as uncertain, as
much a vague part of the future, as it had ever been.It seemed to the girl, at the moment, as if she fairly hated Winton.As though Hilary and she did not already know every stick and stone in
it, had not long ago exhausted all its possibilities!New people might think it "quaint" and "pretty" but they had not lived
here all their lives.And, besides, she had expressly told Uncle Paul
that the doctor had said that Hilary needed a change.She was still brooding over the downfall of her hopes, when her mother
called to her from the garden.Pauline went down, feeling that it
mattered very little what her father's decision had been--it could make
so little difference to them, either way.Shaw was on the bench under the old elm, that stood midway between
parsonage and church.She had been rereading Uncle Paul's letter, and
to Pauline's wonder, there was something like a smile of amusement in
her eyes."Well, dear, your father and I have talked the matter over, and we have
decided to allow you to accept your uncle's offer."How is Hilary to get a chance--here in
Winton?""Who was it that I heard saying, only this morning, Pauline, that even
if Uncle Paul didn't agree, she really believed we might manage to have
a very pleasant summer here at home?""I know--but still, now that we know definitely--"

"We can go to work definitely to do even better."Suppose you put your wits to work
right now.I must go down to Jane's for a few moments.After all,
Pauline, those promised twenty-fives can be used very pleasantly--even
in Winton.""Winton may develop some unexplored corners, some new outlooks."Pauline looked rather doubtful; then, catching sight of a small
dejected-looking little figure in the swing, under the big cherry-tree
at the foot of the lawn, she asked, "I suppose I may tell Patience now,
mother?She really has been very good all this time of waiting."Only, not too many details, Pauline.Patience is
of such a confiding disposition.""Patience," Pauline called, "suppose we go see if there aren't some
strawberries ripe?"As if she didn't know
they were only a pretext.Grown people were assuredly very queer--but
sometimes, it was necessary to humor, their little whims and ways."I don't believe they are ripe yet," she said, skipping along beside
her sister."Is that what you wrote and asked Uncle Paul?And didn't you ask for
us all to go?""Certainly not--we're not sick," said Pauline, laughing."Miranda says what Hilary needs is a good herb tonic!""What is Uncle Paul going to do then?""Send some money every month--to have good times with at home.""And _you_ don't call that _nice_!Well of all the ungratefullest
girls!Is it for us _all_ to have good times with?Patience fairly jumped up and down with excitement."When will they
begin, and what will they be like?O Paul, just think of the good
times we've had _without_ any money 't all!They had reached the strawberry-bed and Patience dropped down in the
grass beside it, her hands clasped around her knees."Good times in
Winton will be a lot better than good times anywhere else.Winton's
such a nice sociable place."Pauline settled herself on the top rail of the fence bordering the
garden at the back."What sort
of good times do you mean?""We have such a lot of picnics--year after year!""A nice picnic is always sort of new.Miranda does put up such
beautiful lunches.O Paul, couldn't we afford chocolate layer cake
_every_ time, now?""And maybe there'll be an excursion somewhere's, and by'n'by there'll
be the town fair.And another and--"

"See here, hold on, Impatience!"Pauline protested, as the berries
disappeared, one after another, down Patience's small throat."Perhaps, if you stop eating them all, we can get enough for mother's
and father's supper.""Maybe they went and hurried to get ripe for to-night, so we could
celebrate," Patience suggested."Paul, mayn't I go with you next time
you go over to The Maples?""I hate 'we'll see's'!"Patience declared, reaching so far over after a
particularly tempting berry, that she lost her balance, and fell face
down among them.she sighed, as her sister came to her assistance,
"something always seems to happen clean-apron afternoon!Paul,
wouldn't it be a 'good time,' if Miranda would agree not to scold 'bout
perfectly unavoidable accidents once this whole summer?""Who's to do the deciding as to the unavoidableness?""Come on, Patience, we've got about all the ripe ones, and it must be
time for you to lay the supper-table.""Not laying supper-tables would be another good time," Patience
answered."We did get enough, didn't we?"I wonder," Pauline said, more as if speaking to herself, "whether
maybe mother wouldn't think it good to have Jane in now and then--for
extra work?She likes to work with Miranda--she says
Miranda's such a nice lady."I'm thinking about other things just now.""I  don't--There's  mother.Goodness, Miranda's got the cloth on!"To Patience's astonishment, nothing was said at supper, either of Uncle
Paul's letter, or the wonderful things it was to lead to.Shaw
kept his wife engaged with parish subjects and Pauline appeared lost in
thoughts of her own.Patience fidgeted as openly as she dared.Of all
queer grown-ups--and it looked as though most grown-ups were more or
less queer--father was certainly the queerest.Of course, he knew
about the letter; and how could he go on talking about stupid,
uninteresting matters--like the Ladies' Aid and the new hymn books?Even the first strawberries of the season passed unnoticed, as far as
he was concerned, though Mrs.Shaw gave Patience a little smiling nod,
in recognition of them."Mother," Pauline exclaimed, the moment her father had gone back to his
study, "I've been thinking--Suppose we get Hilary to pretend--that
coming home is coming to a _new_ place?We'll think up all the interesting things to do, that we can, and
the pretty places to show her.""That would be a good plan, Pauline.""And if she's company, she'll have to have the spare room," Patience
added."Only, mother, Hilary doesn't
like the spare room; she says it's the dreariest room in the house.""If she's company, she'll have to pretend to like it, it wouldn't be
good manners not to," Patience observed.The prospect opening out
ahead of them seemed full of delightful possibilities."I hope Miranda
catches on to the game, and gives us pound-cake and hot biscuits for
supper ever so often, and doesn't call me to do things, when I'm busy
entertaining 'the company.'""Mother," Pauline broke in--"do keep quiet.Impatience--couldn't we do
the spare room over--there's that twenty-five dollars?"We might make some alterations, dear--at least.""We'll take stock the first thing to-morrow morning.I suppose we
can't really start in before Monday.""Hardly, seeing that it is Friday night."They were still talking this new idea over, though Patience had been
sent to bed, when Mr.Shaw came in from a visit to a sick parishioner."We've got the most beautiful scheme on hand, father," Pauline told
him, wheeling forward his favorite chair.She hoped he would sit down
and talk things over with them, instead of going on to the study; it
wouldn't be half as nice, if he stayed outside of everything."New schemes appear to be rampant these days," Mr.Shaw said, but he
settled himself comfortably in the big chair, quite as though he meant
to stay with them.He listened, while Pauline explained, really listened, instead of
merely seeming to."It does appear an excellent idea," he said; "but
why should it be Hilary only, who is to try to see Winton with new eyes
this summer?Maybe Uncle Paul's thought isn't such a bad one, after all.""Paul always believed in developing the opportunities nearest hand,"
Mr.He stroked the head Towser laid against his knee."Your mother and I will be the gainers--if we keep all our girls at
home, and still achieve the desired end."How could she have thought him
unheeding--indifferent?"Somehow, I think it will work out all right," she said."Anyhow,
we're going to try it, aren't we.Patience thinks it the
best idea ever, there'll be no urging needed there."Pauline went up to bed that night feeling strangely happy.For one
thing the uncertainty was over, and if they set to work to make this
summer full of interest, to break up the monotony and routine that
Hilary found so irksome, the result must be satisfactory.And lastly,
there was the comforting conviction, that whatever displeasure her
father had felt at first, at her taking the law into her own hands in
such unforeseen fashion, had disappeared now; and he was not going to
stay "outside of things," that was sure.The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Pauline ran up-stairs
to the spare room.She threw open the shutters of the four windows,
letting in the fresh morning air.The side windows faced west, and
looked out across the pleasant tree-shaded yard to the church; those at
the front faced south, overlooking the broad village street.In the bright sunlight, the big square room stood forth in all its prim
orderliness."It is ugly," Pauline decided, shaking her head
disapprovingly, but it had possibilities.No room, with four such
generous windows and--for the fire-board must come out--such a wide
deep fireplace, could be without them.She turned, as her mother came in, duly attended by Patience."It is
hideous, isn't it, mother?The paper, I mean--and the carpet isn't
much better.It did very well, I suppose, for the visiting
ministers--probably they're too busy thinking over their sermons to
notice--but for Hilary--"

Mrs.As to the
unattractiveness of the paper--"

"We must repaper--that's sure; plain green, with a little touch of
color in the border, and, oh, Mother Shaw, wouldn't a green and white
matting be lovely?""It wouldn't take all the twenty-five, I'm sure.Miranda'll do the
papering, I know.Mother, couldn't we
have Jane in for the washing and ironing this week, and let Miranda get
right at this room?I'll help with the ironing, too."Miranda is rather fussy about letting other
people do her regular work, you know.""And remember, Pauline, each day is going to bring new demands--don't
put all your eggs into one basket."We needn't spend anything on this room except for the paper
and matting."Half an hour later, Pauline was on her way down to the village store
for samples of paper.She had already settled the matter with Miranda,
over the wiping of the breakfast dishes.Miranda had lived with the Shaws ever since Pauline was a baby, and was
a very important member of the family, both in her own and their
opinion.She was tall and gaunt, and somewhat severe looking; however,
in her case, looks were deceptive.It would never have occurred to
Miranda that the Shaws' interests were not her interests--she
considered herself an important factor in the upbringing of the three
young people.If she had a favorite, it was probably Hilary."Hmn," she said, when Pauline broached the subject of the spare room,
"what put that notion in your head, I'd like to know!That paper ain't
got a tear in it!"So Pauline went further, telling her something of Uncle Paul's letter
and how they hoped to carry his suggestion out.Miranda stood still, her hands in the dish water--"That's your pa's own
brother, ain't it?""And Miranda--"

"I reckon he ain't much like the minister.Well, me an' Sarah Jane
ain't the least bit alike--if we are sisters.I guess I can manage
'bout the papering.But it does go 'gainst me, having that sexton
woman in.Still, I reckon you can't be content, 'till we get started.Looking for the old gentleman up, later, be you?"The minister's getting on, and the other one's
considerable older, I understand.""I don't think he will be up," Pauline answered; she hadn't thought of
that before.Half way down the street, Pauline was overtaken by her younger sister."Are you going to get the new things now, Paul?""Of course not, just get some samples.""There's always such a lot of getting ready first," Patience sighed."Paul, mother says I may go with you to-morrow afternoon.""Only, you've got to promise not to 'hi
yi' at Fanny all the way.""You needn't say what we want the new paper for, or anything about what
we are planning to do--in the store I mean.""Miranda says you're beginning to put on considerable airs, since
you've been turning your hair up, Paul Shaw.When I put my hair up,
I'm going on being just as nice and friendly with folks, as before,
you'll see."Pauline laughed, which was not at all to Patience's liking."All the
same, mind what I say," she warned.Patience asked, as they reached the store.Pauline went through to the little annex devoted to
wall papers and carpetings.It was rather musty and dull in there,
Patience thought; she would have liked to make a slow round of the
whole store, exchanging greetings and various confidences with the
other occupants.The store was a busy place on Saturday morning, and
Patience knew every man, woman and child in Winton.They had got their samples and Pauline was lingering before a new line
of summer dressgoods just received, when the young fellow in charge of
the post-office and telegraph station called to her: "I say, Miss Shaw,
here's a message just come for you.""For me--"  Pauline took it wonderingly.Her hands were trembling, she
had never received a telegram before--Was Hilary?Boyd would have first been
obliged to come in to Winton.Out on the sidewalk, she tore open the envelope, not heeding Patience's
curious demands.It was from her uncle, and read--

"Have some one meet the afternoon train Saturday, am sending you an aid
towards your summer's outings.""Oh," Pauline said, "do hurry, Patience.I want to get home as fast as
I can."CHAPTER IV

BEGINNINGS

Sunday afternoon, Pauline and Patience drove over to The Maples to see
Hilary.They stopped, as they went by, at the postoffice for Pauline
to mail a letter to her uncle, which was something in the nature of a
very enthusiastic postscript to the one she had written him Friday
night, acknowledging and thanking him for his cheque, and telling him
of the plans already under discussion."And now," Patience said, as they turned out of the wide main street,
"we're really off.I reckon Hilary'll be looking for us, don't you?""I presume she will," Pauline answered."Maybe she'll want to come back with us."She knows mother wants her to stay the week
out.Listen, Patty--"

Patience sat up and took notice.When people Pattied her, it generally
meant they had a favor to ask, or something of the sort."Remember, you're to be very careful not to let Hilary
suspect--anything.""Won't she like it--all, when she does know?""It's like having a fairy godmother,
isn't it?If you'd had three wishes, Paul, wouldn't
you've chosen--"

"You'd better begin quieting down, Patience, or Hilary can't help
suspecting something.""If she knew--she wouldn't stay a single
day longer, would she?""That's one reason why she mustn't know.""When will you tell her; or is mother going to?"See here, Patience, you may drive--if you won't hi
yi.""Please, Paul, let me, when we get to the avenue.It's stupid coming
to a place, like Fanny'd gone to sleep.""Not before--and only once then," Pauline stipulated, and Patience
possessed her soul in at least a faint semblance of patience until they
turned into the avenue of maples.Then she suddenly tightened her hold
on the reins, bounced excitedly up and down, crying sharply--"Hi yi!"Fanny instantly pricked up her ears, and, what was more to the purpose,
actually started into what might almost have been called a trot.Patience said proudly, as they turned into the yard."I heard Impatience urging her
Rosinante on," she laughed."Why didn't you let her drive all the way,
Paul?"We've been pretty nearly since dinner getting here, it seems to me,"
Patience declared."We had to wait for Paul to write a letter first
to--"

"Are you alone?"Pauline broke in hurriedly, asking the first question
that came into her mind.Boyd's asleep in the
sitting-room, and Mrs.Boyd's taking a nap up-stairs in her own room.""_Have_ you brought me something to read?I've finished both the books
I brought with me, and gone through a lot of magazines--queer old
things, that Mrs."Then you've done very wrong," Pauline told her severely, leading Fanny
over to a shady spot at one side of the yard and tying her to the
fence--a quite unnecessary act, as nothing would have induced Fanny to
take her departure unsolicited.Pauline came back, carrying a small paper-covered parcel.Hilary cried, taking it eagerly and sitting down on the steps.Even more than her sisters, she had
inherited her father's love of books, and a new book was an event at
the parsonage."Oh," she cried again, taking off the paper and
disclosing the pretty tartan cover within, "O Paul!Don't you remember those bits we read in those odd
magazines Josie lent us?"I reckon mother told father about it; I saw her
following him out to the gig yesterday morning."They went around to the little porch leading from Hilary's room, always
a pleasant spot in the afternoons."Why," Patience exclaimed, "it's like an out-door parlor, isn't it?"There was a big braided mat on the floor of the porch, its colors
rather faded by time and use, but looking none the worse for that, a
couple of rockers, a low stool, and a small table, covered with a bit
of bright cretonne.On it stood a blue and white pitcher filled with
field flowers, beside it lay one or two magazines.Just outside,
extending from one of the porch posts to the limb of an old cherry
tree, hung Hilary's hammock, gay with cushions."Shirley did it yesterday afternoon," Hilary explained."She was over
here a good while.Boyd let us have the things and the chintz for
the cushions, Shirley made them, and we filled them with hay."Pauline, sitting on the edge of the low porch, looked about her with
appreciative eyes."How pleasant and cozy it is, and after all, it
only took a little time and trouble."Hilary laid her new book on the table."How soon do you suppose we can
go over to the manor, Paul?I imagine the Dayres have fixed it up
mighty pretty.He and Shirley
are ever so--chummy.He's Shirley Putnam Dayre, and she's Shirley
Putnam Dayre, Junior.So he calls her 'Junior' and she calls him
'Senior.'He's an artist,
they've been everywhere together.And, Paul, they think Winton is
delightful.Dayre says the village street, with its great
overhanging trees, and old-fashioned houses, is a picture in itself,
particularly up at our end, with the church, all ivy-covered.He means
to paint the church sometime this summer.""It would make a pretty picture," Pauline said thoughtfully."Hilary,
I wonder--"

"So do I," Hilary said."Still, after all, one would like to see
different places--"

"And love only one," Pauline added; she turned to her sister."You are
better, aren't you--already?"Shirley's promised to take me out on the lake soon.She's going to be friends with us, Paul--really friends.She says we
must call her 'Shirley,' that she doesn't like 'Miss Dayre,' she hears
it so seldom.""I think it's nice--being called 'Miss,'" Patience remarked, from where
she had curled herself up in the hammock."I suppose she doesn't want
it, because she can have it--I'd love to be called 'Miss Shaw.'""Hilary," Pauline said, "would you mind very much, if you couldn't go
away this summer?""It wouldn't do much good if I did, would it?""The not minding would--to mother and the rest of us--"

"And if you knew what--" Patience began excitedly."Don't you want to go find Captain, Impatience?"Pauline asked hastily,
and Patience, feeling that she had made a false move, went with most
unusual meekness."I--shouldn't wonder, if the child had some sort of scheme on hand,"
Pauline said, she hoped she wasn't--prevaricating; after all, Patience
probably did have some scheme in her head--she usually had."I haven't thought much about going away the last day or so," Hilary
said."I suppose it's the feeling better, and, then, the getting to
know Shirley."Pauline sat silent for some moments; she was
watching a fat bumble bee buzzing in and out among the flowers in the
garden.It was always still, over here at the farm, but to-day, it
seemed a different sort of stillness, as if bees and birds and flowers
knew that it was Sunday afternoon."Paul," Hilary asked suddenly, "what are you smiling to yourself about?"I guess because it is so nice and
peaceful here and because--Hilary, let's start a club--the 'S.No, I shan't tell you what the letters stand
for!You've got to think it out for yourself."Josie and Tom, and you and I--and I think, maybe,
mother and father.""It was he who put the idea into my head."Hilary came to sit beside her sister on the step."Paul, I've a
feeling that there is something--up!"Feelings are very unreliable things to go by, but
I've one just now--that if we don't hunt Impatience up pretty
quick--there will be something doing."They found Patience sitting on the barn floor, utterly regardless of
her white frock.Boyd says I may have my choice, to take home with me," Hilary
said.The parsonage cat had died the fall before, and had had no
successor as yet.Patience held up a small coal-black one.Miranda says a black cat brings luck, though it don't look like we
needed any black cats to bring--"

"I like the black and white one," Pauline interposed, just touching
Patience with the tip of her shoe.Boyd would give us each one, that would leave one for her,"
Patience suggested cheerfully."I imagine mother would have something to say to that," Pauline told
her."Was Josie over yesterday, Hilary?"As they were going back to the house, they met Mr.Boyd, on his way to
pay his regular weekly visit to the far pasture."There won't be time, Patience," Pauline said.Boyd objected, "I'll be back to supper, and you girls
are going to stay to supper."He carried Patience off with him,
declaring that he wasn't sure he should let her go home at all, he
meant to keep her altogether some day, and why not to-night?"Oh, I couldn't stay to-night," the child assured him earnestly."Of
course, I couldn't ever stay for always, but by'n'by, when--there isn't
so much going on at home--there's such a lot of things keep happening
at home now, only don't tell Hilary, please--maybe, I could come make
you a truly visit."Indoors, Pauline and Hilary found Mrs.Boyd down-stairs again from her
nap."Only to see her," Pauline answered, and while she helped Mrs.Boyd get
supper, she confided to her the story of Uncle Paul's letter and the
plans already under way."Bless me, it'll do her a heap of good,
you'll see, my dear.I'm not sure, I don't agree with your uncle, when
all's said and done, home's the best place for young folks."Just before Pauline and Patience went home that evening, Mrs.Boyd
beckoned Pauline mysteriously into the best parlor."I always meant
her to have them some day--she being my god-child--and maybe they'll do
her as much good now, as any time, she'll want to fix up a bit now and
then, most likely.Shirley had on a string of them last night, but not
to compare with these."Boyd was kneeling before a trunk in the
parlor closet, and presently she put a little square shell box into
Pauline's bands."Box and all, just like they came to me--you know,
they were my grandmother's--but Hilary's a real careful sort of girl."Boyd--I'm not sure that mother would--"  Pauline knew quite
well what was in the box.You just slip them in Hilary's top drawer, where
she'll come across them without expecting it.Deary me, I never wear
them, and as I say, I've always meant to give them to her some day.""She'll be perfectly delighted--and they'll look so pretty.Hilary's
got a mighty pretty neck, I think."Pauline went out to the gig, the
little box hidden carefully in her blouse, feeling that Patience was
right and that these were very fairy-story sort of days."You'll be over again soon, won't you?""We're going to be tre-men-dous-ly busy," Patience began, but her
sister cut her short."As soon as I can, Hilary.By Monday noon, the spare room had lost its look of prim order.In the
afternoon, Pauline and her mother went down to the store to buy the
matting.There was not much choice to be had, and the only green and
white there was, was considerably beyond the limit they had allowed
themselves."Never mind," Pauline said cheerfully, "plain white will look ever so
cool and pretty--perhaps, the green would fade.Over a low wicker sewing-chair, she did linger longingly; it would look
so nice beside one of the west windows.She meant to place a low table
for books and work between those side windows.In the end, prudence
won the day, and surely, the new paper and matting were enough to be
grateful for in themselves.By the next afternoon the paper was on and the matting down.Pauline
was up garret rummaging, when she heard someone calling her from the
foot of the stairs."I'm here, Josie," she called back, and her friend
came running up.Pauline held up an armful of old-fashioned chintz."It makes one think of high-waisted
dresses, and minuets and things like that.""They were my great-grandmother's bed curtains.""I'm not sure mother will let me do anything.I came across them just
now in looking for some green silk she said I might have to cover
Hilary's pin-cushion with."Patience has been doing the honors of the new paper
and matting--it's going to be lovely, I think."Pauline scrambled to her feet, shaking out the chintz: "If only mother
would--it's pink and green--let's go ask her.""What do you want to do with it, Pauline?""I haven't thought that far--use it for draperies of some kind, I
suppose," the girl answered.They were standing in the middle of the big, empty room.Suddenly,
Josie gave a quick exclamation, pointing to the bare corner between the
front and side windows."Wouldn't a cozy corner be delightful--with
cover and cushions of the chintz?""I suppose so, dear--only where is the bench part to come from?""Tom'll make the frame for it, I'll go get him this minute," Josie
answered."And you might use that single mattress from up garret," Mrs.Pauline ran up to inspect it, and to see what other treasures might be
forthcoming.The garret was a big, shadowy place, extending over the
whole house, and was lumber room, play place and general refuge, all in
one.Presently, from under the eaves, she drew forward a little
old-fashioned sewing-chair, discarded on the giving out of its cane
seat."But I could tack a piece of burlap on and cover it with a
cushion," Pauline decided, and bore it down in triumph to the new room,
where Tom Brice was already making his measurements for the cozy corner.Josie was on the floor, measuring for the cover.Tom says it won't take long to do his part."Tom straightened himself, slipping his rule into his pocket."I don't
see what you want it for, though," he said."'Yours not to reason why--'" Pauline told him."We see, and so will
Hilary.Don't you and Josie want to join the new club--the 'S."Society of Willing Females, I suppose?""It sounds like some sort of sewing circle," Josie said.Pauline sat down in one of the wide window places."I'm not sure it
might not take in both.It is--'The Seeing Winton First Club.'"Josie looked as though she didn't quite understand, but Tom whistled
softly."What else have you been doing for the past fifteen years, if
you please, ma'am?""One ought to know a place rather thoroughly in
fifteen years, I suppose; but--I'm hoping we can make it seem at least
a little bit new and different this summer--for Hilary.You see, we
shan't be able to send her away, and so, I thought, perhaps, if we
tried looking at Winton--with new eyes--"

"I see," Josie cried."I think it's a splendiferous ideal"

"And, I thought, if we formed a sort of club among ourselves and worked
together--"

"Listen," Josie interrupted again, "we'll make it a condition of
membership, that each one must, in turn, think up something pleasant to
do.""It will be so--necessarily--won't it?"For Winton
was not rich in young people."There will be enough of us," Josie declared hopefully."Not less than the
Graces, nor more than the Muses."And so the new club was formed then and there.There were to be no
regular and formal meetings, no dues, nor fines, and each member was to
consider himself, or herself, an active member of the programme
committee.Tom, as the oldest member of their immediate circle of friends, was
chosen president before that first meeting adjourned; no other officers
were considered necessary at the time.And being president, to him was
promptly delegated the honor--despite his vigorous protests--of
arranging for their first outing and notifying the other members--yet
to be."But," he expostulated, "what's a fellow to think up--in a hole like
this?"It was one of the chief
occupations of Josie's life at present, to contradict all such
heretical utterances on Tom's part.He was to go away that fall to
commence his studies for the medical profession, for it was Dr.Brice's
great desire that, later, his son should assist him in his practice.But, so far, Tom though wanting to follow his father's profession, was
firm in his determination, not to follow it in Winton."And remember," Pauline said, as the three went down-stairs together,
"that it's the first step that counts--and to think up something very
delightful, Tom.""It mustn't be a picnic, I suppose?Hilary won't be up to picnics yet
awhile.""N-no, and we want to begin soon.She'll be back Friday, I think,"
Pauline answered.By Wednesday night the spare room was ready for the expected guest."It's as if someone had waved a fairy wand over it, isn't it?""I think she will and--pleased."Pauline gave one of the cushions in
the cozy corner a straightening touch, and drew the window
shades--Miranda had taken them down and turned them--a little lower."It's a regular company room, isn't it?"The minister drove over to The Maples himself on Friday afternoon to
bring Hilary home."Remember," Patience pointed a warning forefinger at him, just as he
was starting, "not a single solitary hint!""Not a single solitary one," he promised."Well,
he's off at last!But, oh, dear, however can we wait 'til he gets
back?"CHAPTER V

BEDELIA

It was five o'clock that afternoon when Patience, perched, a little
white-clad sentry, on the gate-post, announced joyously--"They're
coming!Patience was as excited as if the expected "guest" were one in fact, as
well as name.It was fun to be playing a game of make-believe, in
which the elders took part.As the gig drew up before the steps, Hilary looked eagerly out."Will
you tell me," she demanded, "why father insisted on coming 'round the
lower road, by the depot--he didn't stop, and he didn't get any parcel?And when I asked him, he just laughed and looked mysterious.""He went," Pauline answered, "because we asked him to--company usually
comes by train--real out-of-town company, you know.""Like visiting ministers and returned missionaries," Patience explained.You must be," she glanced from one to another, "you're all dressed up,"

"We were expecting some, dear," her mother told her, "but she has
arrived."Shaw patted the hand Hilary slipped into hers."You have come
back a good deal better than you went, my dear."And it didn't turn out a stupid--half-way affair, after all," Hilary
declared.Only, I simply had to come home, I
felt somehow--that--that--"

"We were expecting company?""I reckon that was it," Hilary agreed.As she sat there, resting a
moment, before going up-stairs, she hardly seemed the same girl who had
gone away so reluctantly only eight days before.The change of scene,
the outdoor life, the new friendship, bringing with it new interests,
had worked wonders,

"And now," Pauline suggested, taking up her sister's valise, "perhaps
you would like to go up to your room--visitors generally do.""To rest after your journey, you know," Patience prompted.Patience
believed in playing one's part down to the minutest detail."Thank you," Hilary answered, with quite the proper note of formality
in her voice, "if you don't mind; though I did not find the trip as
fatiguing as I had expected."But from the door, she turned back to give her mother a second and most
uncompany-like hug."It is good to be home, Mother Shaw!And please,
you don't want to pack me off again anywhere right away--at least, all
by myself?""Not right away," her mother answered, kissing her."I guess you will think it is good to be home, when you
know--everything," Patience announced, accompanying her sisters
up-stairs, but on the outside of the banisters.Pauline protested laughingly--"Was there ever such a child for
letting things out!"the child exclaimed, "only now--it can't make any
difference.""Oh, what have
you all been up to?"Patience cried, as Hilary stopped before
the door of her own and Pauline's room."Of course you're not," Pauline told her."It strikes me, for
company--you're making yourself very much at home!She led the way along the hall to the spare room,
throwing the door wide open.Hilary cried, then stood quite still on the threshold, looking
about her with wide, wondering eyes.The spare room was grim and gray no longer.Hilary felt as if she must
be in some strange, delightful dream.The cool green of the wall
paper, with the soft touch of pink in ceiling and border, the fresh
white matting, the cozy corner opposite--with its delicate
old-fashioned chintz drapery and big cushions, the new toilet
covers--white over green, the fresh curtains at the windows, the
cushioned window seats, the low table and sewing-chair, even her own
narrow white bed, with its new ruffled spread, all went to make a room
as strange to her, as it was charming and unexpected."Oh," she said again, turning to her mother, who had followed them
up-stairs, and stood waiting just outside the door."How perfectly
lovely it all is--but it isn't for me?""Of course it is," Patience said."Aren't you company--you aren't just
Hilary now, you're 'Miss Shaw' and you're here on a visit; and there's
company asked to supper to-morrow night, and it's going to be such fun!"It was something deeper and better than
fun.She understood now why they had done this--why Pauline had said
that--about her not going away; there was a sudden lump in the girl's
throat--she was glad, so glad, she had said that downstairs----about
not wanting to go away.And when her mother and Patience had gone down-stairs again and Pauline
had begun to unpack the valise, as she had unpacked it a week ago at
The Maples, Hilary sat in the low chair by one of the west windows, her
hands folded in her lap, looking about this new room of hers."There," Pauline said presently, "I believe that's all now--you'd
better lie down, Hilary--I'm afraid you're tired.""No, I'm not; at any rate, not very.I'll lie down if you like, only I
know I shan't be able to sleep."Pauline lowered the pillow and threw a light cover over her."There's
something in the top drawer of the dresser," she said, "but you're not
to look at it until you've lain down at least half an hour.""I feel as if I were in an enchanted palace,", Hilary said, "with so
many delightful surprises being sprung on me all the while."After
Pauline had gone, she lay watching the slight swaying of the wild roses
in the tall jar on the hearth.The wild roses ran rampant in the
little lane leading from the back of the church down past the old
cottage where Sextoness Jane lived.Jane had brought these with her
that morning, as her contribution to the new room.To Hilary, as to Patience, it seemed as if a magic wand had been waved,
transforming the old dull room into a place for a girl to live and
dream in.But for her, the name of the wand was Love.There must be no more impatient longings, no fretful repinings, she
told herself now.She must not be slow to play her part in this new
game that had been originated all for her.The half-hour up, she slipped from the bed and began unbuttoning her
blue-print frock.Being company, it stood to reason she must dress for
supper.But first, she must find out what was in the upper drawer.The first glimpse of the little shell box, told her that.There were
tears in Hilary's gray eyes, as she stood slipping the gold beads
slowly through her fingers.How good everyone was to her; for the
first time some understanding of the bright side even of sickness--and
she had not been really sick, only run-down--and, yes, she had been
cross and horrid, lots of times--came to her."I'll go over just as soon as I can and thank her," the girl thought,
clasping the beads about her neck, "and I'll keep them always and
always."A little later, she came down-stairs all in white, a spray of the pink
and white wild roses in her belt, her soft, fair hair freshly brushed
and braided.She had been rather neglectful of her hair lately.There was no one on the front piazza but her father, and he looked up
from his book with a smile of pleasure."My dear, how well you are
looking!It is certainly good to see you at home again, and quite your
old self."Hilary came to sit on the arm of his chair."It is good to be at home
again.I suppose you know all the wonderful surprises I found waiting
me?""Supper's ready," Patience proclaimed from the doorway."Please come,
because--" she caught herself up, putting a hand into Hilary's, "I'll
show you where to sit, Miss Shaw."she asked, in the tone
frequently used by visiting ministers."I'm a good deal older than I'm treated generally," Patience answered."I am sure I shall like it very much."Hilary slipped into the chair
Patience drew forward politely."The company side of the table--sure
enough," she laughed."It isn't proper to say things to yourself sort of low down in your
voice," Patience reproved her, then at a warning glance from her mother
subsided into silence as the minister took his place.For to-night, at least, Miranda had amply fulfilled Patience's hopes,
as to company suppers.And she, too, played her part in the new game,
calling Hilary "Miss," and never by any chance intimating that she had
seen her before."Did you go over to the manor to see Shirley?""I promised her Pauline and I would be over
soon.We may have Fanny some afternoon, mayn't we, father?""They can't have Fanny, can they,
father?""Nothing is the matter with her," Pauline said hurriedly."Don't pay
any attention to her.""Only, if you would hurry," Patience implored."I--I can't wait much
longer!""For--Well, if you just knew what for,
Hilary Shaw, you'd do some pretty tall hustling!""I'll wait out on the
porch.""Is there anything more--to see, I mean, not to eat?""I
don't see how there can be.""Because, if you are, I'll show
you.""It was sent to Paul," Patience called, from the hall door."But she
says, of course, it was meant for us all; and I think, myself, she's
right about that.""'It' was--before supper," Pauline told her."I certainly hope nothing
has happened to--'it' since then.""Wait and see; by the way, where's that kitten?""She's to follow in a few days; she was a bit too young to leave home
just yet."Hilary stopped short at the foot of the porch steps.Patience's
remark, if it had not absolutely let the cat out of the bag, had at
least opened the bag."Paul, it can't be--"

"In the Shaw's dictionary, at present, there doesn't appear to be any
such word as can't," Pauline declared."Come on---after all, you know,
the only way to find out--is to find out."Patience had danced on ahead down the path to the barn.She stood
waiting for them now in the broad open doorway, her whole small person
one animated exclamation point, while Towser, just home from a
leisurely round of afternoon visits, came forward to meet Hilary,
wagging a dignified welcome."If you don't hurry, I'll 'hi yi' you, like I do Fanny!"She moved to one side, to let Hilary go on into the barn.she demanded, "isn't that something more?"From the stall beside Fanny's, a horse's head reached inquiringly out
for the sugar with which already she had come to associate the frequent
visits of these new friends.She was a pretty, well-made, little mare,
light sorrel, with white markings, and with a slender, intelligent face.Hilary stood motionless, too surprised to speak."Her name's Bedelia," Patience said, doing the honors."She's very
clever, she knows us all already.Fanny hasn't been very polite to
her, and she knows it--Bedelia does, I mean--sometimes, when Fanny
isn't looking, I've caught Bedelia sort of laughing at her--and I don't
blame her one bit.And, oh, Hilary, she can go--there's no need to 'hi
yi' her.""But--" Hilary turned to Pauline."Uncle Paul sent her," Pauline explained.One of the men from Uncle Paul's place in the country
brought her.She was born and bred at River Lawn--that's Uncle Paul's
place--he says."Hilary stroked the glossy neck gently, if Pauline had said the Sultan
of Turkey, instead of Uncle Paul, she could hardly have been more
surprised."Uncle Paul--sent her to you!""Bless me, that isn't all he sent," Patience exclaimed.It seemed to
Patience that they never would get to the end of their story."You
just come look at this, Hilary Shaw!"she ran on through the opening
connecting carriage-house with stable.Hilary cried, following with Pauline.Beside the minister's shabby old gig, stood the smartest of smart
traps, and hanging on the wall behind it, a pretty russet harness, with
silver mountings.Hilary sat down on an old saw horse; she felt again as though she must
be dreaming."There isn't another such cute rig in town, Jim says so," Patience
said."It beats Bell Ward's all to pieces.""But why--I mean, how did Uncle Paul ever come to send it to us?"Of course one had always known that there
was--somewhere--a person named Uncle Paul; but he had appeared about as
remote and indefinite a being as--that same Sultan of Turkey, for
instance."But I don't believe he would've if Paul had not written to him that
time," Patience added."Maybe next time I tell you anything, you'll
believe me, Hilary Shaw.""Was--was that the letter--you remember, that afternoon?""I was in the mood to dare anything that day.""And did he answer; but of course he did."Paul, you
didn't ask him to send you--these," Hilary waved her hand rather
vaguely."Hardly--he did that all on his own.It wasn't a bad sort of letter,
I'll tell you about it by and by.We can go to the manor in style now,
can't we--even if father can't spare Fanny.Bedelia's perfectly
gentle, I've driven her a little ways once or twice, to make sure.We created quite a sensation down
street, I assure you."Dane said," Patience cut in, "that in her young days,
clergymen didn't go kiting 'bout the country in such high-fangled rigs."Dane said, or didn't say," Pauline told her.Dane hasn't got to say on any subject,
wouldn't make you tired listening to it.""Patience, if you don't stop repeating what everyone says, I shall--"

"If you speak to mother--then you'll be repeating," Patience declared."Maybe, I oughtn't to have said those things before--company.""I think we'd better go back to the house now," Pauline suggested."Sextoness Jane says," Patience remarked, "that she'd have sure admired
to have a horse and rig like that, when she was a girl.She says, she
doesn't suppose you'll be passing by her house very often.""And, now, please," Hilary pleaded, when she had been established in
her hammock on the side porch, with her mother in her chair close by,
and Pauline sitting on the steps, "I want to hear--everything.I'm
what Miranda calls 'fair mazed.'"So Pauline told nearly everything, blurring some of the details a
little and getting to that twenty-five dollars a month, with which they
were to do so much, as quickly as possible."O Paul, really," Hilary sat up among her cushions--"Why, it'll
be--riches, won't it?""But--Oh, I'm afraid you've spent all the first twenty-five on me; and
that's not a fair division--is it, Mother Shaw?""We used it quite according to Hoyle," Pauline insisted."We got our
fun that way, didn't we, Mother Shaw?""All the same, after this, you've simply got to 'drink fair, Betsy,' so
remember," Hilary warned them.Shaw said, and Patience got slowly out of her
big, wicker armchair."I did think--seeing there was company,--that probably you'd like me to
stay up a little later to-night.""If the 'company' takes my advice, she'll go, too," her mother answered.Hilary slipped out of the hammock."Mother, do you suppose Miranda's gone to bed yet?""I'll go see," Patience offered, willing to postpone the inevitable for
even those few moments longer."No--and it must be done to-night."I thought it would be that way, dear.""Miranda's  coming,"  Patience  called."She'd just taken her back
hair down, and she's waiting to twist it up again.She's got awful
funny back hair.""I mean, there's such a little--"

"Go up-stairs and get yourself ready for bed at once.""You ain't took sick, Hilary?""Please, Miranda, if it wouldn't be too much
trouble, will you bring Pauline's bed in here?""I guessed as much," Miranda said, moving Hilary's bed to one side."Hilary--wouldn't you truly rather have a room to yourself--for a
change?""I have had one to myself--for eight days--and, now I'm going back to
the old way."Sitting among the cushions of the cozy corner, Hilary
superintended operations, and when the two single white beds were
standing side by side, in their accustomed fashion, the covers turned
back for the night, she nodded in satisfied manner."Thank you so
much, Miranda; that's as it should be.To-morrow, you must move in regularly.Upper drawer between us, and
the rest share and share alike, you know."Patience, who had hit upon the happy expedient of braiding her
hair--braids, when there were a lot of them, took a long time--got
slowly up from the hearth rug, her head a sight to behold, with its
tiny, hornlike red braids sticking out in every direction."I suppose
I'd better be going.I wish I had someone to talk to, after I'd gone
to bed."Pauline kissed the wistful little face."Never mind, old girl, you
know you'd never stay awake long enough to talk to anyone."She and Hilary stayed awake talking, however, until Pauline's prudence
got the better of her joy in having her sister back in more senses than
one.It was so long since they had had such a delightful bedtime talk."Seeing Winton First Club," Hilary said musingly."Paul, you're ever
so clever.Shirley insisted those letters stood for 'Suppression of
Woman's Foibles Club'; and Mr.Dayre suggested they meant, 'Sweet Wild
Flowers.'""You've simply got to go to sleep now, Hilary, else mother'll  come and
take me away.""I'll never say again--that nothing ever
happens to us."Tom and Josie came to supper the next night.Shirley was there, too,
she had stopped in on her way to the post-office with her father that
afternoon, to ask how Hilary was, and been captured and kept to supper
and the first club meeting that followed.Hilary had been sure she would like to join, and Shirley's prompt and
delighted acceptance of their invitation proved her right."I've only got five names on my list," Tom said, as the young folks
settled themselves on the porch after supper."I suppose we'll think
of others later.""That'll make ten, counting us five, to begin with," Pauline said."Bell and Jack Ward," Tom took out his list, "the Dixon boys and Edna
Ray."I'd just like to know where I come in, Tom Brice!"Patience demanded,
her voice vibrant with indignation.I didn't suppose--"

"I am to belong!"But Patty--"

"If you're going to say no, you needn't Patty me!""We'll see what mother thinks," Hilary suggested."You wouldn't want
to be the only little girl to belong?""I shouldn't mind," Patience assured her, then feeling pretty sure that
Pauline was getting ready to tell her to run away, she decided to
retire on her own account.That blissful time, when she should be
"Miss Shaw," had one drawback, which never failed to assert itself at
times like these--there would be no younger sister subject to her
authority."Have you decided what we are to do?"Pauline asked Tom, when Patience
had gone.You'll be up to a ride by next Thursday, Hilary?"I'm sure I shall," Hilary answered eagerly."He won't even tell me," Josie said."You're none of you to know until next Thursday."Oh," Shirley said, "I think it's going to be the nicest club that ever
was."CHAPTER VI

PERSONALLY CONDUCTED

"Am I late?"Shirley asked, as Pauline came down the steps to meet her
Thursday afternoon."No, indeed, it still wants five minutes to four.Will you come in, or
shall we wait out here?Hilary is under bond not to make her
appearance until the last minute.""Out here, please," Shirley answered, sitting down on the upper step.Father has at last succeeded in
finding me my nag, horses appear to be at a premium in Winton, and even
if he isn't first cousin to your Bedelia, I'm coming to take you and
Hilary to drive some afternoon.Father got me a surrey, because,
later, we're expecting some of the boys up, and we'll need a two-seated
rig.""We're coming to take you driving, too," Pauline said."Just at
present, it doesn't seem as if the summer would be long enough for all
the things we mean to do in it.""And you don't know yet, what we are to do this afternoon?""Only, that it's to be a drive and, afterwards, supper at the Brices'.That's all Josie, herself, knows about it.Through the drowsy stillness of the summer afternoon, came the notes of
a horn, sounding nearer and nearer.A moment later, a stage drawn by
two of the hotel horses turned in at the parsonage drive at a fine
speed, drawing up before the steps where Pauline and Shirley were
sitting, with considerable nourish.Beside the driver sat Tom, in long
linen duster, the megaphone belonging to the school team in one hand.Along each side of the stage was a length of white cloth, on which was
lettered--

      SEEING WINTON STAGE

As the stage stopped, Tom sprang down, a most businesslike air on his
boyish face."This is the Shaw residence, I believe?"he asked, consulting a piece
of paper."I--I reckon so," Pauline answered, too taken aback to know quite what
she was saying."I understand--"

"Then it's a good deal more than I do," Pauline cut in."That there are several young people here desirous of joining our
little sight-seeing trip this afternoon."From around the corner of the house at that moment peeped a small
freckled face, the owner of which was decidedly very desirous of
joining that trip.Only a deep sense of personal injury kept Patience
from coming forward,--she wasn't going where she wasn't wanted--but
some day--they'd see!Shirley clapped her hands delightedly.Oh, I am
glad you asked me to join the club.""Tom, however--"

"I beg your pardon, Miss?""Oh, I say, Paul," Tom dropped his mask of pretended dignity, "let the
Imp come with us--this time."She, as well as Tom, had caught sight of that
small flushed face, on which longing and indignation had been so
plainly written."I'm not sure that mother will--" she began, "But
I'll see.""Tell her--just this first time," Tom urged, and Shirley added, "She
would love it so.""Mother says," Pauline reported presently, "that Patience may go _this_
time--only we'll have to wait while she gets ready.""She'll never forget it--as long as she lives," Shirley said, "and if
she hadn't gone she would never've forgotten _that_.""Nor let us--for one while," Pauline remarked--"I'd a good deal rather
work with than against that young lady."Hilary came down then, looking ready and eager for the outing.She had
been out in the trap with Pauline several times; once, even as far as
the manor to call upon Shirley."Why," she exclaimed, "you've brought the Folly!Tom, how ever did you
manage it?"Hilary shrugged her shoulders, coming nearer for a closer inspection of
the big lumbering stage.It had been new, when the present proprietor
of the hotel, then a young man, now a middle-aged one, had come into
his inheritance.Fresh back from a winter in town, he had indulged
high hopes of booming his sleepy little village as a summer resort, and
had ordered the stage--since christened the Folly--for the convenience
and enjoyment of the guests--who had never come.A long idle lifetime
the Folly had passed in the hotel carriage-house; used so seldom, as to
make that using a village event, but never allowed to fall into
disrepair, through some fancy of its owner.As Tom opened the door at the back now, handing his guests in with much
ceremony, Hilary laughed softly."It doesn't seem quite--respectful to
actually sit down in the poor old thing.I wonder, if it's more
indignant, or pleased, at being dragged out into the light of day for a
parcel of young folks?""'Butchered to make a Roman Holiday'?"At that moment Patience appeared, rather breathless--but not half as
much so as Miranda, who had been drawn into service, and now appeared
also--"You ain't half buttoned up behind, Patience!"she protested,
"and your hair ribbon's not tied fit to be seen.--My sakes, to think of
anyone ever having named that young one _Patience_!""I'll overhaul her, Miranda," Pauline comforted her."Please, I am to sit up in front with you, ain't I, Tom?""You and I always get on so beautifully together, you know.""I don't see how I can refuse after that,"
and the over-hauling process being completed, Patience climbed up to
the high front seat, where she beamed down on the rest with such a look
of joyful content that they could only smile back in response."Not too far, Tom, for Hilary;
and remember, Patience, what you have promised me."Shaw," Tom assured her, and Patience nodded her head
assentingly.From the parsonage, they went first to the doctor's.Josie was waiting
for them at the gate, and as they drew up before it, with horn blowing,
and horses almost prancing--the proprietor of the hotel had given them
his best horses, in honor of the Folly--she stared from her brother to
the stage, with its white placard, with much the same look of wonder in
her eyes as Pauline and Hilary had shown."So that's what you've been concocting, Tom Brice!"Tom's face was as sober as his manner."I am afraid we are a little
behind scheduled time, being unavoidably delayed.""He means they had to wait for me to get ready," Patience explained."You didn't expect to see me along, did you, Josie?""I don't know what I did expect--certainly, not this."Josie took her
place in the stage, not altogether sure whether the etiquette of the
occasion allowed of her recognizing its other inmates, or not.she remarked, while Shirley asked, if she had ever made this trip
before."Not in this way," Josie answered."I've never ridden in the Folly
before."Once, from the depot to the hotel, when I was a youngster, about
Impatience's age.Uncle Jerry was
the name the owner of the stage went by in Winton."He'd had a lot of
Boston people up, and had been showing them around.""This reminds me of the time father and I did our own New York in one
of those big 'Seeing New York' motors," Shirley said."I came home
feeling almost as if we'd been making a trip 'round some foreign city.""Tom can't make Winton seem foreign," Josie declared.There were three more houses to stop at, lower down the street.From
windows and porches all along the route, laughing, curious faces stared
wonderingly after them, while a small body-guard of children sprang up
as if by magic to attend them on their way.This added greatly to the
delight of Patience, who smiled condescendingly down upon various
intimates, blissfully conscious of the envy she was exciting in their
breasts.It was delightful to be one of the club for a time, at least."And now, if you please, Ladies and Gentlemen," Tom had closed the door
to upon the last of his party, "we will drive first to The Vermont
House, a hostelry well known throughout the surrounding country, and
conducted by one of Vermont's best known and honored sons.""I say, Tom, get that off again where
Uncle Jerry can hear it, and you'll always be sure of his vote."They had reached the rambling old hotel, from the front porch of which
Uncle Jerry himself, surveyed them genially."Ladies and Gentlemen," standing up, Tom turned to face the occupants
of the stage, his megaphone, carried merely as a badge of office,
raised like a conductor's baton, "I wish to impress upon your minds
that the building now before you--liberal rates for the season--is
chiefly remarkable for never having sheltered the Father of His
Country.""Ain't that North
Chamber called the 'Washington room'?""Oh, but that's because the first proprietor's first wife occupied that
room--and she was famous for her Washington pie," Tom answered readily."I assure you, sir, that any and all information which I shall have the
honor to impart to these strangers within our gates may be relied upon
for its accuracy."He gave the driver the word, and the Folly
continued on its way, stopping presently before a little
story-and-a-half cottage not far below the hotel and on a level with
the street."This cottage, my young friends," Tom said impressively, "should
be--and I trust is--enshrined deep within the hearts of all true
Wintonites.Latterly, it has come to be called the Barker cottage, but
its real title is 'The Flag House'; so called, because from that humble
porch, the first Stars and Stripes ever seen in Winton flung its colors
to the breeze.The original flag is still in possession of a lineal
descendant of its first owner, who is, unfortunately, not an inhabitant
of this town."The boyish gravity of tone and manner was not all
assumed now.No one spoke for a moment; eleven pairs of young eyes were looking out
at the little weather-stained building with new interest."I thought,"
Bell Ward said at last, "that they called it the _flag_ place, because
someone of that name had used to live there."As the stage moved on, Shirley leaned back for another look."I shall
get father to come and sketch it," she said."Isn't it the quaintest
old place?""We will now proceed," Tom announced, "to the village green, where I
shall have the pleasure of relating to you certain anecdotes regarding
the part it played in the early life of this interesting old village.""Not too many, old man," Tracy Dixon suggested hurriedly, "or it may
prove a one-sided pleasure."The green lay in the center of the town,--a wide, open space, with
flagstaff in the middle; fine old elms bordered it on all four sides.The Vermont House faced it, on the north, and on the opposite side
stood the general store, belonging to Mr.Ward, with one or two smaller
places of business."The business section" of the town, Tom called it, and quite failed to
notice Tracy's lament that he had not brought his opera glasses with
him."Really, you know," Tracy explained to his companions, "I should
have liked awfully to see it."Cut that out," his brother Bob commanded, "the chap up in front is
getting ready to hold forth again."They were simple enough, those anecdotes, that "the chap up in front"
told them; but in the telling, the boy's voice lost again all touch of
mock gravity.His listeners, sitting there in the June sunshine,
looking out across the old green, flecked with the waving tree shadows,
and bright with the buttercups nodding here and there, seemed to see
those men and boys drilling there in the far-off summer twilights; to
hear the sharp words of command; the sound of fife and drum.And the
familiar names mentioned more than once, well-known village names,
names belonging to their own families in some instances, served to
deepen the impression."Why," Edna Ray said slowly, "they're like the things one learns at
school; somehow, they make one realize that there truly was a
Revolutionary War.Wherever did you pick up such a lot of town
history, Tom?"Back up the broad, main street they went, past the pleasant village
houses, with their bright, well-kept dooryards, under the
wide-spreading trees beneath which so many generations of young folks
had come and gone; past the square, white parsonage, with its setting
of green lawn; past the old stone church, and on out into the by-roads
of the village, catching now and then a glimpse of the great lake
beyond; and now and then, down some lane, a bit of the street they had
left.They saw it all with eyes that for once had lost the
indifference of long familiarity, and were swift to catch instead its
quiet, restful beauty, helped in this, perhaps, by Shirley's very real
admiration.Brice's gate, and here Tom dropped his mantle of
authority, handing all further responsibility as to the entertainment
of the party over to his sister.Hilary was carried off to rest until supper time, and the rest
scattered about the garden, a veritable rose garden on that June
afternoon, roses being Dr."It must be lovely to _live_ in the country," Shirley said, dropping
down on the grass before the doctor's favorite _La France_, and laying
her face against the soft, pink petals of a half-blown bud.She had rather resented the admittance of
this city girl into their set.Shirley's skirt and blouse were of
white linen, there was a knot of red under the broad sailor collar, she
was hatless and the dark hair,--never kept too closely within
bounds--was tossed and blown; there was certainly nothing especially
cityfied in either appearance or manner."That's the way I feel about the city," Edna said slowly, "it must be
lovely to live _there_."I reckon just being alive anywhere such days
as these ought to content one.You haven't been over to the manor
lately, have you?We're really getting
the garden to look like a garden.Reclaiming the wilderness, father
calls it.You'll come over now, won't you--the club, I mean?""Why, of course," Edna answered, she thought she would like to go."I
suppose you've been over to the forts?""Lots of times--father's ever so interested in them, and it's just a
pleasant row across, after supper.""I have fasted too long, I must eat again," Tom remarked, coming across
the lawn."Miss Dayre, may I have the honor?""Are you conductor, or merely club president now?""Oh, I've dropped into private life again.There comes Hilary--doesn't
look much like an invalid, does she?""But she didn't look very well the first time I saw her," Shirley
answered.The long supper table was laid under the apple trees at the foot of the
garden, which in itself served to turn the occasion into a festive
affair."You've given us a bully send-off, Mr."It's
going to be sort of hard for the rest of us to keep up with you.""By the way," Tom said, "Dr.Brice--some of you may have heard of
him--would like to become an honorary member of this club.Patience had been
remarkably good that afternoon--so good that Pauline began to feel
worried, dreading the reaction."One who has all the fun and none of the work," Tracy explained, a
merry twinkle in his brown eyes."I shouldn't mind the work; but mother
won't let me join regularly--mother takes notions now and then--but,
please mayn't I be an honorary member?""Onery, you mean, young lady!"Patience flashed a pair of scornful eyes at him."Father says punning
is the very lowest form of--"

"Never mind, Patience," Pauline said, "we haven't answered Tom yet.I
vote we extend our thanks to the doctor for being willing to join.""He isn't a bit more willing than I am," Patience observed.There was
a general laugh among the real members, then Tom said, "If a Shaw votes
for a Brice, I don't very well see how a Brice can refuse to vote for a
Shaw.""The motion is carried," Bob seconded him."Subject to mother's consent," Pauline added, a quite unnecessary bit
of elder sisterly interference, Patience thought."And now, even if it is telling on yourself, suppose you own up, old
man?""You see we don't in the least credit
you with having produced all that village history from your own stores
of knowledge.""I never said you need to," Tom answered, "even the idea was not
altogether original with me."Patience suddenly leaned forward, her face all alight with interest."I love my love with an A," she said slowly, "because he's an--author.""Well, of all the uncanny young ones!""It's very simple," Patience said loftily."So it is, Imp," Tracy exclaimed; "I love him with an A, because he's
an--A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N!""I took him to the sign of The Apple Tree," Bell took up the thread."And fed him (mentally) on subjects--antedeluvian, or almost so,"
Hilary added."I saw him and Tom walking down the back lane the other night,"
Patience explained.Patience felt that she had won her right to belong
to the club now--they'd see she wasn't just a silly little girl."Father says he--I don't mean Tom--"

"We didn't suppose you did," Tracy laughed."Knows more history than any other man in the state; especially, the
history of the state."Why, father and I read
one of his books just the other week."He surely does," Bob grinned, "and every little while he comes up to
school and puts us through our paces.It's his boast that he was born,
bred and educated right in Vermont.He isn't a bad old buck--if he
wouldn't pester a fellow with too many questions.""He lives out beyond us," Hilary told Shirley."There's a great apple
tree right in front of the gate.He has an old house-keeper to look
after him.I wish you could see his books--he's literally surrounded
with them.""He says, they're books full of
stories, if one's a mind to look for them.""Please," Edna protested, "let's change the subject.Are we to have
badges, or not?""Pins would have to be made to order," Pauline objected, "and would be
more or less expensive.""And it's an unwritten by-law of this club, that we shall go to no
unnecessary expense," Tom insisted."Oh, I know what you're thinking," Tom broke in, "but Uncle Jerry
didn't charge for the stage--he said he was only too glad to have the
poor thing used--'twas a dull life for her, shut up in the
carriage-house year in and year out.""The Folly isn't a she," Patience protested."Folly generally is feminine," Tracy said, "and so--"

"And he let us have the horses, too--for our initial outing," Tom went
on."Said the stage wouldn't be of much use without them.""Let's make him an
honorary member.""I never saw such people for going off at
tangents.""Ribbon would be pretty," Shirley suggested, "with the name of the club
in gilt letters.Her suggestion was received with general acclamation, and after much
discussion, as to color, dark blue was decided on."Blue goes rather well with red," Tom said, "and as two of our members
have red hair," his glance went from Patience to Pauline."I move we adjourn, the president's getting personal," Pauline pushed
back her chair."Who's turn is it to be next?"They drew lots with blades of grass; it fell to Hilary."I warn you,"
she said, "that I can't come up to Tom."Then the first meeting of the new club broke up, the members going
their various ways.Shirley went as far as the parsonage, where she
was to wait for her father."I've had a beautiful time," she said warmly."And I've thought what
to do when my turn comes.Only, I think you'll have to let father in
as an honorary, I'll need him to help me out.""We'll be only too glad," Pauline said heartily."This club's growing
fast, isn't it?Hilary shook her head, "N-not exactly; I've sort of an idea."CHAPTER VII

HILARY'S TURN

Pauline and Hilary were up in their own room, the "new room," as it had
come to be called, deep in the discussion of certain samples that had
come in that morning's mail.Uncle Paul's second check was due before long now, and then there were
to be new summer dresses, or rather the goods for them, one apiece all
around."Because, of course," Pauline said, turning the pretty scraps over,
"Mother Shaw's got to have one, too.We'll have to get it--on the
side--or she'll declare she doesn't need it, and she does.""Just the goods won't come to so very much," Hilary said."No, indeed, and mother and I can make them.""We certainly got a lot out of that other check, or rather, you and
mother did," Hilary went on."Pretty nearly, except the little we decided to lay by each month.But
we did stretch it out in a good many directions.I don't suppose any
of the other twenty-fives will seem quite so big.""But there won't be such big things to get with them," Hilary said,
"except these muslins.""It's unspeakably delightful to have money for the little unnecessary
things, isn't it?"That first check had really gone a long ways.After buying the matting
and paper, there had been quite a fair sum left; enough to pay for two
magazine subscriptions, one a review that Mr.Shaw had long wanted to
take, another, one of the best of the current monthlies; and to lay in
quite a store of new ribbons and pretty turnovers, and several yards of
silkaline to make cushion covers for the side porch, for Pauline,
taking hint from Hilary's out-door parlor at the farm, had been quick
to make the most of their own deep, vine-shaded side porch at the
parsonage.The front piazza belonged in a measure to the general public, there
were too many people coming and going to make it private enough for a
family gathering place.But the side porch was different, broad and
square, only two or three steps from the ground; it was their favorite
gathering place all through the long, hot summers.With a strip of carpet for the floor, a small table resurrected from
the garret, a bench and three wicker rockers, freshly painted green,
and Hilary's hammock, rich in pillows, Pauline felt that their porch
was one to be proud of.To Patience had been entrusted the care of
keeping the old blue and white Canton bowl filled with fresh flowers,
and there were generally books and papers on the table.And they might
have done it all before, Pauline thought now, if they had stopped to
think.Hilary asked her, glancing at the sober face bent
over the samples."I believe I'd forgotten all about them; I think I'll choose this--"
Pauline held up a sample of blue and white striped dimity."You can have it, if you like.""Oh, no, I'll have the pink.""And the lavender dot, for Mother Shaw?""Patience had better have straight white, it'll be in the wash so
often.""Why not let her choose for herself, Paul?"Patience called excitedly, at that moment
from downstairs.Hilary called back, and Patience came hurrying up, stumbling
more than once in her eagerness.The next moment, she pushed wide the
door of the "new room."It's addressed to you,
Hilary--it came by express--Jed brought it up from the depot!"She deposited her burden on the table beside Hilary.It was a
good-sized, square box, and with all that delightful air of mystery
about it that such packages usually have."What do you suppose it is, Paul?""Why, I've never had
anything come unexpectedly, like this, before.""A whole lot of things are happening to us that never've happened
before," Patience said.she pointed to
the address at the upper left-hand corner of the package."Oh, Hilary,
let me open it, please, I'll go get the tack hammer.""Tell mother to come," Hilary said.she added, as Patience scampered off."It doesn't seem quite heavy enough for books.""It isn't another Bedelia, at all events.Hilary, I believe Uncle Paul is really glad I
wrote to him.""Well, I'm not exactly sorry," Hilary declared."Mother can't come yet," Patience explained, reappearing.Dane; she just seems to know when
we don't want her, and then to come--only, I suppose if she waited 'til
we did want to see her, she'd never get here."Impatience, and you'd better not let her hear
you saying it," Pauline warned.But Patience was busy with the tack hammer."You can take the inside
covers off," she said to Hilary."Thanks, awfully," Hilary murmured."It'll be my turn next, won't it?"Patience dropped the tack hammer,
and wrenched off the cover of the box--"Go ahead, Hilary!For Hilary was going about her share of the unpacking in the most
leisurely way."I want to guess first," she said."A picture, maybe," Pauline suggested.Patience dropped cross-legged
on the floor."Then I don't think Uncle Paul's such a very sensible
sort of person," she said.Hilary lifted something from within the box, "but
something to get pictures with."It's a three and a quarter by four and a quarter.We can have fun
now, can't we?""Tom'll show you how to use it," Pauline said."He fixed up a dark
room last fall, you know, for himself."Patience came to investigate the
further contents of the express package."Films and those funny little
pans for developing in, and all."Inside the camera was a message to the effect that Mr.Shaw hoped his
niece would be pleased with his present and that it would add to the
summer's pleasures,

"He's getting real uncley, isn't he?"Then she
caught sight of the samples Pauline had let fall."They'd make pretty scant ones, I'd say," Pauline, answered.Patience spread the bright scraps out on her blue checked
gingham apron.But at the present moment, her small sister was quite impervious to
sarcasm."I think I'll have this," she pointed to a white ground,
closely sprinkled with vivid green dots.Pauline declared, glancing at her sister's red
curls."You'd look like an animated boiled dinner!If you please, who
said anything about your choosing?""You look ever so nice in all white, Patty," Hilary said hastily.She looked up quickly, her blue eyes very persuasive."I don't very often have a brand new, just-out-of-the-store dress, do
I?""Only don't let it be the green then.Good, here's
mother, at last!""Mummy, is blue or green better?"Shaw examined and duly admired the camera, and decided in favor of
a blue dot; then she said, "Mrs.Boyd is down-stairs, Hilary."Boyd exclaimed, as Hilary came into the
sitting-room, "how you are getting on!Why, you don't look like the
same girl of three weeks back."Hilary sat down beside her on the sofa."I've got a most tremendous
favor to ask, Mrs.I hear you young folks are having fine times
lately.Shirley was telling me about the club the other night.""It's about the club--and it's in two parts; first, won't you and Mr.Boyd be honorary members?--That means you can come to the good times if
you like, you know.--And the other is--you see, it's my turn next--"
And when Pauline came down, she found the two deep in consultation.The next afternoon, Patience carried out her long-intended plan of
calling at the manor.Shaw was from home for the day, Pauline and
Hilary were out in the trap with Tom and Josie and the camera."So
there's really no one to ask permission of, Towser," Patience
explained, as they started off down the back lane."Father's got the
study door closed, of course that means he mustn't be disturbed for
anything unless it's absolutely necessary."He was quite ready for a ramble this
bright afternoon, especially a ramble 'cross lots.Shirley and her father were not at home, neither--which was even more
disappointing--were any of the dogs; so, after a short chat with Betsy
Todd, considerably curtailed by that body's too frankly expressed
wonder that Patience should've been allowed to come unattended by any
of her elders, she and Towser wandered home again.In the lane, they met Sextoness Jane, sitting on the roadside, under a
shady tree.She and Patience exchanged views on parish matters,
discussed the new club, and had an all-round good gossip.Jane said, her faded eyes bright with interest, "it must
seem like Christmas all the time up to your house."She looked past
Patience to the old church beyond, around which her life had centered
itself for so many years."There weren't ever such doings at the
parsonage--nor anywhere else, what I knowed of--when I was a girl.Seems like she give an air to the whole
place--so pretty and high-stepping--it's most's good's a circus--not
that I've ever been to a circus, but I've hear tell on them--just to
see her go prancing by.""I think," Patience said that evening, as they were all sitting on the
porch in the twilight, "I think that Jane would like awfully to belong
to our club.""'The S. W. F. Club,' I mean; and you
know it, Paul Shaw.When I get to be fifteen, I shan't act half so
silly as some folks.""What ever put that idea in your head?"It was one of
Hilary's chief missions in life to act as intermediary between her
younger and older sister."Oh, I just gathered it, from what she said.Towser and I met her this
afternoon, on our way home from the manor."her mother asked quickly, with that faculty for
taking hold of the wrong end of a remark, that Patience had had
occasion to deplore more than once.And in the diversion this caused, Sextoness Jane was forgotten.Pauline called from the foot of the
stairs.Hilary finished tying the knot of cherry ribbon at her throat, then
snatching up her big sun-hat from the bed, she ran down-stairs.Before the side door, stood the big wagon, in which Mr.Boyd had driven
over from the farm, its bottom well filled with fresh straw.For
Hilary's outing was to be a cherry picnic at The Maples, with supper
under the trees, and a drive home later by moonlight.Shirley had brought over the badges a day or two before; the blue
ribbon, with its gilt lettering, gave an added touch to the girls'
white dresses and cherry ribbons.Dayre had been duly made an honorary member.He and Shirley were
to meet the rest of the party at the farm.As for Patience H. M., as
Tom called her, she had been walking very softly the past few days.There had been no long rambles without permission, no making calls on
her own account.There _had_ been a private interview between herself
and Mr.Boyd, whom she had met, not altogether by chance, down street
the day before.The result was that, at the present moment, Patience--white-frocked,
blue-badged, cherry-ribboned--was sitting demurely in one corner of the
big wagon.Boyd chuckled as he glanced down at her; a body'd have to get up
pretty early in the morning to get ahead of that youngster.Though not
in white, nor wearing cherry ribbons, Mr.Boyd sported his badge with
much complacency.'Twasn't such a
slow old place, after all.he asked, as Pauline slipped a couple of big pasteboard
boxes under the wagon seat, and threw in some shawls for the coming
home.Remember, you and father have got
to come with us one of these days.Boyd can take a
holiday you can.""Good-by," Hilary called, and Patience waved joyously."This'll make
two times," she comforted herself, "and two times ought to be enough to
establish what father calls 'a precedent.'"They stopped at the four other houses in turn; then Mr.Boyd touched
his horses up lightly, rattling them along at a good rate out on to the
road leading to the lake and so to The Maples.There was plenty of fun and laughter by the way.They had gone
picnicking together so many summers, this same crowd, had had so many
good times together."And yet it seems different, this year, doesn't
it?""We really aren't doing new things--exactly, still
they seem so.""These are the 'Blue Ribbon Brand,' best
goods in the market.""Come to think of it, there aren't so very many new things one can do,"
Tom remarked."Not in Winton, at any rate," Bob added."If anyone dares say anything derogatory to Winton, on this, or any
other, outing of the 'S.W. F. Club,' he, or she, will get into
trouble," Josie said sternly.Boyd was waiting for them on the steps, Shirley close by, while a
glimpse of a white umbrella seen through the trees told that Mr."It's the best cherry season in years," Mrs.Boyd declared, as the
young folks came laughing and crowding about her.She was a prime
favorite with them all."It's in my top drawer, dear.Looks like I'm too old to go wearing
such things, though 'twas ever so good in you to send me one.""Hilary," Pauline turned to her sister, "I'm sure Mrs.Boyd'll let you
go to her top drawer.Not a stroke of business does this club do,
until this particular member has her badge on.""Now," Tom asked, when that little matter had been attended to, "what's
the order of the day?""I haven't, ma'am," Tracy announced."Eat all you like--so long's you don't get sick--and each pick a nice
basket to take home," Mrs.There were no cherries
anywhere else quite so big and fine, as those at The Maples."Boys to pick, girls to pick up," Tom ordered, as they scattered about
among the big, bountifully laden trees."For cherry time,
  Is merry time,"

Shirley improvised, catching the cluster of great red and white
cherries Jack tossed down to her.Even more than the rest of the young folks, Shirley was getting the
good of this happy, out-door summer, with its quiet pleasures and
restful sense of home life.She had never known anything before like
it.It was very different, certainly, from the studio life in New
York, different from the sketching rambles she had taken other summers
with her father.They were delightful, too, and it was pleasant to
think of going back to them again--some day; but just at present, it
was good to be a girl among other girls, interested in all the simple,
homely things each day brought up.And her father was content, too, else how could she have been so?It
was doing him no end of good.Painting a little, sketching a little,
reading and idling a good deal, and through it all, immensely amused at
the enthusiasm with which his daughter threw herself into the village
life."I shall begin to think soon, that you were born and raised in
Winton," he had said to her that very morning, as she came in fresh
from a conference with Betsy Todd.Betsy might be spending her summer
in a rather out-of-the-way spot, and her rheumatism might prevent her
from getting into town--as she expressed it--but very little went on
that Betsy did not hear of, and she was not one to keep her news to
herself."So shall I," Shirley had laughed back.She wondered now, if Pauline
or Hilary would enjoy a studio winter, as much as she was reveling in
her Winton summer?Cherry time _was_ merry time that afternoon.Bob fell out
of one of the trees, but Bob was so used to tumbling, and the others
were so used to having him tumble, that no one paid much attention to
it; and equally, of course, Patience tore her dress and had to be taken
in hand by Mrs."Every rose must have its thorns, you know, kid," Tracy told her, as
she was borne away for this enforced retirement."We'll leave a few
cherries, 'gainst you get back."Patience elevated her small freckled nose, she was an adept at it."I
reckon they will be mighty few--if you have anything to do with it.""You're having a fine time, aren't you, Senior?"Dayre came scrambling down from his tree; he had been routed from his
sketching and pressed into service by his indefatigable daughter.Shirley, you've got a fine color--only it's laid on in
spots.""You're spattery, too," she retorted."I must go help lay out the
supper now.""Will anyone want supper, after so many cherries?"Some of the boys brought the table from the house, stretching it out to
its uttermost length.Boyd provided,
and unpacked the boxes stacked on the porch.From the kitchen came an
appetizing odor of hot coffee.Hilary and Bell went off after flowers
for the center of the table."We'll put one at each place, suggestive of the person--like a place
card," Hilary proposed.Boyd and cut her one of these old-fashioned
spice pinks," Hilary said."Better put a bit of pepper-grass for the Imp," Tracy suggested, as the
girls went from place to place up and down the long table."Paul's to have a <DW29>," Hilary insisted.She remembered how, if it
hadn't been for Pauline's "thought" that wet May afternoon, everything
would still be as dull and dreary as it was then.At her own place she found a spray of belated wild roses, Tom had laid
there, the pink of their petals not more delicate than the soft color
coming and going in the girl's face."We've brought for-get-me-not for you, Shirley," Bell said, "so that
you won't forget us when you get back to the city.""Sound the call to supper, sonny!"Tom told Bob, and Bob, raising the
farm dinner-horn, sounded it with a will, making the girls cover their
ears with their hands and bringing the boys up with a rush."It's a beautiful picnic, isn't it?"Patience said, reappearing in time
to slip into place with the rest."And after supper, I will read you the club song," Tracy announced."Read it now, son--while we eat," Tom suggested.Tracy rose promptly--"Mind you save me a few scraps then.First, it
isn't original--"

"All the better," Jack commented."Hush up, and listen--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is.And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ."'It's a habit to be happy,
    Just as much as to be scrappy.So put the frown away awhile,
    And try a little sunny smile.'"Tracy tossed the scrap of
paper across the table to Bell."Put it to music, before the next
round-up, if you please.""We've got a club song and a club badge, and we ought to have a club
motto," Josie said."It's right to your hand, in your song," her brother answered."'It's
a habit to be happy.'"Pauline seconded him, and the motto was at once adopted.CHAPTER VIII

SNAP-SHOTS

Bell Ward set the new song to music, a light, catchy tune, easy to pick
up.It took immediately, the boys whistled it, as they came and went,
and the girls hummed it.Patience, with cheerful impartiality, did
both, in season and out of season.It certainly looked as though it were getting to be a habit to be happy
among a good many persons in Winton that summer.The spirit of the new
club seemed in the very atmosphere.A rivalry, keen but generous, sprang up between the club members in the
matter of discovering new ways of "Seeing Winton," or, failing that, of
giving a new touch to the old familiar ones.There were many informal and unexpected outings, besides the club's
regular ones, sometimes amongst all the members, often among two or
three of them.Frequently, Shirley drove over in the surrey, and she and Pauline and
Hilary, with sometimes one of the other girls, would go for long
rambling drives along the quiet country roads, or out beside the lake.Shirley generally brought her sketch-book and there were pleasant
stoppings here and there.And there were few days on which Bedelia and the trap were not out,
Bedelia enjoying the brisk trots about the country quite as much as her
companions.Hilary soon earned the title of "the kodak fiend," Josie declaring she
took pictures in her sleep, and that "Have me; have my camera," was
Hilary's present motto.Certainly, the camera was in evidence at all
the outings, and so far, Hilary had fewer failures to her account than
most beginners.Her "picture diary" she called the big scrap-book in
which was mounted her record of the summer's doings.Those doings were proving both numerous and delightful.Shaw, as
an honorary member, had invited the club to a fishing party, which had
been an immense success.The doctor had followed it by a moonlight
drive along the lake and across on the old sail ferry to the New York
side, keeping strictly within that ten-mile-from-home limit, though
covering considerably more than ten miles in the coming and going.There had been picnics of every description, to all the points of
interest and charm in and about the village; an old-time supper at the
Wards', at which the club members had appeared in old-fashioned
costumes; a strawberry supper on the church lawn, to which all the
church were invited, and which went off rather better than some of the
sociables had in times past.As the Winton _Weekly News_ declared proudly, it was the gayest summer
the village had known in years.Paul Shaw's theory about
developing home resources was proving a sound one in this instance at
least.Hilary had long since forgotten that she had ever been an invalid, had
indeed, sometimes, to be reminded of that fact.She had quite
discarded the little "company" fiction, except now and then, by way of
a joke."I'd rather be one
of the family these days.""That's all very well," Patience retorted, "when you're getting all the
good of being both.Patience had not
found her summer quite as cloudless as some of her elders; being an
honorary member had not meant _all_ of the fun in her case.She wished
very much that it were possible to grow up in a single night, thus
wiping out forever that drawback of being "a little girl."Still, on the whole, she managed to get a fair share of the fun going
on and quite agreed with the editor of the _Weekly News_, going so far
as to tell him so when she met him down street.She had a very kindly
feeling in her heart for the pleasant spoken little editor; had he not
given her her full honors every time she had had the joy of being
"among those present"?There had been three of those checks from Uncle Paul; it was wonderful
how far each had been made to go.It was possible nowadays to send for
a new book, when the reviews were more than especially tempting.There
had also been a tea-table added to the other attractions of the side
porch, not an expensive affair, but the little Japanese cups and
saucers were both pretty and delicate, as was the rest of the service;
while Miranda's cream cookies and sponge cakes were, as Shirley
declared, good enough to be framed.Even the minister appeared now and
then of an afternoon, during tea hour, and the young people, gathered
on the porch, began to find him a very pleasant addition to their
little company, he and they getting acquainted, as they had never
gotten acquainted before.Sextoness Jane came every week now to help with the ironing, which
meant greater freedom in the matter of wash dresses; and also, to
Sextoness Jane herself, the certainty of a day's outing every week.To
Sextoness Jane, those Tuesdays at the parsonage were little short of a
dissipation.Miranda, unbending in the face of such sincere and humble
admiration, was truly gracious.The glimpses the little bent, old
sextoness got of the young folks, the sense of life going on about her,
were as good as a play, to quote her own simile, confided of an evening
to Tobias, her great black cat, the only other inmate of the old
cottage."I reckon Uncle Paul would be rather surprised," Pauline said one
evening, "if he could know all the queer sorts of ways in which we use
his money.But the little easings-up do count for so much.""Indeed they do," Hilary agreed warmly, "though it hasn't all gone for
easings-ups, as you call them, either."She had sat down right in the
middle of getting ready for bed, to revel in her ribbon box; she so
loved pretty ribbons!The committee on finances, as Pauline called her mother, Hilary, and
herself, held frequent meetings."And there's always one thing," the
girl would declare proudly, "the treasury is never entirely empty."She kept faithful account of all money received and spent; each month a
certain amount was laid away for the "rainy day"--which meant, really,
the time when the checks should cease to come---"for, you know, Uncle
Paul only promised them for the _summer_," Pauline reminded the others,
and herself, rather frequently.Nor was all of the remainder ever
quite used up before the coming of the next check."You're quite a business woman, my dear," Mr.Shaw said once, smiling
over the carefully recorded entries in the little account-book she
showed him.She wrote regularly to her uncle; her letters unconsciously growing
more friendly and informal from week to week.They were bright, vivid
letters, more so than Pauline had any idea of.Paul
Shaw felt himself becoming very well acquainted with these young
relatives whom he had never seen, and in whom, as the weeks went by, he
felt himself growing more and more interested.Without realizing it, he got into the habit of looking forward to that
weekly letter; the girl wrote a nice clear hand, there didn't seem to
be any nonsense about her, and she had a way of going right to her
point that was most satisfactory.It seemed sometimes as if he could
see the old white parsonage and ivy-covered church; the broad
tree-shaded lawns; the outdoor parlor, with the young people gathered
about the tea-table; Bedelia, picking her way along the quiet country
roads; the great lake in all its moods; the manor house.Sometimes Pauline would enclose one or two of Hilary's snap-shots of
places, or persons.At one of these, taken the day of the fishing
picnic, and under which Hilary had written "The best catch of the
season," Mr.Somehow he had never
pictured Phil to himself as middle-aged.If anyone had told him, when
the lad was a boy, that the time would come when they would be like
strangers to each other--Mr.Paul Shaw slipped the snap-shot and letter
back into their envelope.It was that afternoon that he spent considerable time over a catalogue
devoted entirely to sporting goods; and it was a fortnight later that
Patience came flying down the garden path to where Pauline and Hilary
were leaning over the fence, paying a morning call to Bedelia, sunning
herself in the back pasture."You'll never guess what's come _this_ time!And Jed says he reckons
he can haul it out this afternoon if you're set on it!And it's
addressed to the 'Misses Shaw,' so that means it's _mine, too_!"Patience dropped on the grass, quite out of breath.The "it" proved to be a row-boat with a double set of oar-locks, a
perfect boat for the lake, strong and safe, but trig and neat of
outline.Hilary named it the "Surprise" at first sight, and Tom was sent for at
once to paint the name in red letters to look well against the white
background and to match the boat's red trimmings.Some of the young people had boats over at
the lake, rather weather-beaten, tubby affairs, Bell declared them,
after the coming of the "Surprise."A general overhauling took place
immediately, the girls adopted simple boating dresses--red and white,
which were their boating colors.A new zest was given to the water
picnics, Bedelia learning to know the lake road very well.August had come before they fairly realized that their summer was more
than well under way.In little more than a month the long vacation
would be over.Tom and Josie were to go to Boston to school; Bell to
Vergennes."There'll never be another summer quite like it!""I can't bear to think of its being over.""It isn't--yet," Pauline answered."Tom's coming," Patience heralded from the gate, and Hilary ran indoors
for hat and camera.Pauline asked, as her sister came
out again."Out by the Cross-roads' Meeting-House," Tom answered."Hilary has
designs on it, I believe.""You'd better come, too, Paul," Hilary urged."It's a glorious morning
for a walk.""I'm going to help mother cut out; perhaps I'll come to meet you with
Bedelia 'long towards noon."_I'm_ not going to be busy this morning," Patience insinuated."Oh, yes you are, young lady," Pauline told her."Mother said you were
to weed the aster bed."Patience looked longingly after the two starting gayly off down the
path, their cameras swung over their shoulders, then she looked
disgustedly at the aster bed.It was quite the biggest of the smaller
beds.--She didn't see what people wanted to plant so many asters for;
she had never cared much for asters, she felt she should care even less
about them in the future.By the time Tom and Hilary reached the old Cross-Roads' Meeting-House
that morning, after a long roundabout ramble, Hilary, for one, was
quite willing to sit down and wait for Pauline and the trap, and eat
the great, juicy blackberries Tom gathered for her from the bushes
along the road.It had rained during the night and the air was crisp and fresh, with a
hint of the coming fall."Summer's surely on the down grade," Tom
said, throwing himself on the bank beside Hilary."So Paul and I were lamenting this morning.I don't suppose it matters
as much to you folks who are going off to school.""Still it means another summer over," Tom said soberly.He was rather
sorry that it was so--there could never be another summer quite so
jolly and carefree."And the breaking up of the club, I suppose?""I don't see why we need call it a break--just a discontinuance, for a
time."There'll be a lot of you left, to keep it going.""Y-yes, but with three, or perhaps more, out, I reckon we'll have to
postpone the next installment until another summer."Tom went off then for more berries, and Hilary sat leaning back against
the trunk of the big tree crowning the top of Meeting-House Hill, her
eyes rather thoughtful.From where she sat, she had a full view of
both roads for some distance and, just beyond, the little hamlet
scattered about the old meeting-house.Before the gate of one of the houses stood a familiar gig, and
presently, as she sat watching, Dr.Brice came down the narrow
flower-bordered path, followed by a woman.At the gate both stopped;
the woman was saying something, her anxious, drawn face seeming out of
keeping with the cheery freshness of the morning and the flowers
nodding their bright heads about her.As the doctor stood listening, his old shabby medicine case in his
hand, with face bent to the troubled one raised to his, and bearing
indicating grave sympathy and understanding, Hilary reached for her
camera."I want it for the book Josie and I are making for you to take away
with you, 'Winton Snap-shots.'Tom looked at the gig, moving slowly off down the road now.He hated
to say so, but he wished Hilary would not put that particular snap-shot
in.He had a foreboding that it was going to make him a bit
uncomfortable--later--when the time for decision came; though, as for
that, he had already decided--beyond thought of change.He wished that
the pater hadn't set his heart on his coming back here to practice--and
he wished, too, that Hilary hadn't taken that photo."It's past twelve," Tom glanced at the sun."Maybe we'd better walk on
a bit."But they had walked a considerable bit, all the way to the parsonage,
in fact, before they saw anything of Pauline.There, she met them at
the gate."Have you seen any trace of Patience--and Bedelia?""They're both missing, and it's pretty safe guessing they're together.""But Patience would never dare--"

"Wouldn't she!""Jim brought Bedelia 'round about
eleven and when I came out a few moments later, she was gone and so was
Patience.We traced them as far as the
Lake road.""I'll go hunt, too," Tom offered."Don't you worry, Paul; she'll turn
up all right--couldn't down the Imp, if you tried.""But she's never driven Bedelia alone; and Bedelia's not Fanny."However, half an hour later, Patience drove calmly into the yard,
Towser on the seat beside her, and if there was something very like
anxiety in her glance, there was distinct triumph in the way she
carried her small, bare head.she announced, smiling pleasantly from
her high seat, at the worried, indignant group on the porch."I tell
you, there isn't any need to 'hi-yi' this horse!""Did you ever hear the beat of that!"Shaw said, and Patience climbed obediently
down.She bore the prompt banishment to her own room which followed,
with seeming indifference.Certainly, it was not unexpected; but when
Hilary brought her dinner up to her presently, she found her sitting on
the floor, her head on the bed.It was only a few days now to
Shirley's turn and it was going to be such a nice turn.Patience felt
that for once Patience Shaw had certainly acted most unwisely.Hilary put the tray on the table and sitting
down on the bed, took the tumbled head on her knee."We've been so
worried!You see, Bedelia isn't like Fanny!""That's why I wanted to get a chance to drive her by myself for once!out on the Lake road I just let her loose!"For
the moment, pride in her recent performance routed all contrition from
Patience's voice--"I tell you, folks I passed just stared!""Patience, how--"

"I wasn't scared the least bit; and, of course, Bedelia knew it.Uncle
Jerry says they always know when you're scared, and if Mr.Allen is the
most up in history of any man in Vermont, Uncle Jerry is the most in
horses."Hilary felt that the conversation was hardly proceeding upon the lines
her mother would have approved of, especially under present
circumstances."That has nothing to do with it, you know, Patience,"
she said, striving to be properly severe.I think it's nice not being scared of
things.You're sort of timid 'bout things, aren't you, Hilary?""It's going to be such a dreadful long
afternoon--all alone.""But I can't stay, mother would not want--"

"Just for a minute.I--coming back,
I met Jane, and I gave her a lift home--and she did love it so--she
says she's never ridden before behind a horse that really went as if it
enjoyed it as much as she did.That was some good out of being bad,
wasn't it?And--I told you--ever'n' ever so long ago, that I was
mighty sure Jane'd just be tickled to death to belong to our club.I
think you might ask her--I don't see why she shouldn't like Seeing
Winton, same's we do--she doesn't ever have fun--and she'll be dead
pretty soon.She's getting along, Jane is--it'd make me mad's anything
to have to die 'fore I'd had any fun to speak of.Jane's really very
good company--when you draw her out--she just needs drawing out--Jane
does.Seems to me, she remembers every funeral and wedding and
everything--that's ever taken place in Winton."Patience stopped,
sheer out of breath, but there was an oddly serious look on her little
eager face.Hilary stroked back the tangled red curls."Maybe you're right, Patty;
maybe we have been selfish with our good times.I'll have to go now,
dear.You--I may tell mother--that you are sorry--truly, Patty?""But I reckon, it's a good deal on account of
Shirley's turn," she explained."You don't suppose you could fix that up with mother?You're pretty
good at fixing things up with mother, Hilary."Hilary laughed, but when she had closed the door, she
opened it again to stick her head in."I'll try, Patty, at any rate,"
she promised.Shaw was busy in the
study and Pauline had gone out on an errand.Hilary went up-stairs
again, going to sit by one of the side windows in the "new room."Over at the church, Sextoness Jane was making ready for the regular
weekly prayer meeting; never a service was held in the church that she
did not set all in order.Through one of the open windows, Hilary
caught sight of the bunch of flowers on the reading-desk.Jane had
brought them with her from home.Presently, the old woman herself came
to the window to shake her dust-cloth, standing there a moment, leaning
a little out, her eyes turned to the parsonage.Pauline was coming up
the path, Shirley and Bell were with her.They were laughing and
talking, the bright young voices making a pleasant break in the quiet
of the garden.It seemed to Hilary, as if she could catch the wistful
look in Jane's faded eyes, a look only half consciously so, as if the
old woman reached out vaguely for something that her own youth had been
without and that only lately she had come to feel the lack of.A quick lump came into the girl's throat.Life had seemed so bright
and full of untried possibilities only that very morning, up there on
Meeting-House Hill, with the wind in one's face; and then had come that
woman, following the doctor down from the path.Life was surely
anything but bright for her this crisp August day--and now here was
Jane.And presently--at the moment it seemed very near indeed to
Hilary--she and Paul and all of them would be old and, perhaps,
unhappy.And then it would be good to remember--that they had tried to
share the fun and laughter of this summer of theirs with others.Hilary thought of the piece of old tapestry hanging on the studio wall
over at the manor--of the interwoven threads--the dark as necessary to
the pattern as the bright.Perhaps they had need of Sextoness Jane, of
the interweaving of her life into theirs--of the interweaving of all
the village lives going on about them--quite as much as those more
sober lives needed the brightening touch of theirs."I'm coming," Hilary answered, and went slowly down to where the others
were waiting on the porch."I've been having a think--and I've come to the conclusion that we're a
selfish, self-absorbed set."Pauline went to the study window, "please come out here.Hilary's calling us names, and that isn't polite.""I hope not very bad names," she said.Hilary swung slowly back and forth in the hammock."I didn't mean it
that way--it's only--"  She told what Patience had said about Jane's
joining the club, and then, rather reluctantly, a little of what she
had been thinking."I think Hilary's right," Shirley declared."Let's form a deputation
and go right over and ask the poor old soul to join here and now.""I would never've thought of it," Bell said."But I don't suppose I've
ever given Jane a thought, anyway.""Patty's mighty cute--for all she's such a terror at times," Pauline
admitted."She knows a lot about the people here--and it's just
because she's interested in them.""Come on," Shirley said, jumping up."We're going to have another
honorary member.""I think it would be kind, girls," Mrs."Jane will
feel herself immensely flattered, and I know of no one who upholds the
honor of Winton more honestly or persistently."Shaw," Shirley coaxed, "when we come back, mayn't
Patience Shaw, H. M., come down and have tea with us?""I hardly think--"

"Please, Mother Shaw," Hilary broke in; "after all--she started this,
you know.That sort of counterbalances the other, doesn't it?""Well, we'll see," her mother laughed.Pauline ran to get one of the extra badges with which Shirley had
provided her, and then the four girls went across to the church.Sextoness Jane was just locking the back door--not the least important
part of the afternoon's duties with her--as they came through the
opening in the hedge."Good afternoon," she said cheerily, "was you
wanting to go inside?""No," Pauline answered, "we came over to invite you to join our club.We thought, maybe, you'd like to?""And wear one of
them blue-ribbon affairs?""See, here it is," and she pointed to
the one in Pauline's hand.Sextoness Jane came down the steps."Me, I ain't never wore a badge!Oncet, when I was a little youngster,'most
like Patience, teacher, she got up some sort of May doings.We was all
to wear white dresses and red, white and blue ribbons--very night
before, I come down with the mumps.Looks like I always come down when
I ought to've stayed up!""But you won't come down with anything this time," Pauline pinned the
blue badge on the waist of Jane's black and white calico."Now you're
an honorary member of 'The S. W. F.She was still stroking it softly as she walked slowly away towards
home.CHAPTER IX

AT THE MANOR

  "'All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock,'"

Patience chanted, moving slowly about the parsonage garden, hands full
of flowers, and the big basket, lying on the grass beyond, almost full.Behind her, now running at full speed, now stopping suddenly, back
lifted, tail erect, came Lucky, the black kitten from The Maples.Lucky had been an inmate of the parsonage for some weeks now and was
thriving famously in her adopted home.Towser tolerated her with the
indifference due such a small, insignificant creature, and she
alternately bullied and patronized Towser."We haven't shepherd's purse, nor lady's smock, that I know of, Lucky,"
Patience said, glancing back at the kitten, at that moment threatening
battle at a polite nodding Sweet William, "but you can see for yourself
that we have hollyhocks, while as for bachelor's buttons!Just look at
that big, blue bunch in one corner of the basket."It was the morning of the day of Shirley's turn and Pauline was
hurrying to get ready to go over and help decorate the manor.She was
singing, too; from the open windows of the "new room" came the words--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is
    And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ.'"To which piece of good advice, Patience promptly whistled back the gay
refrain.On the back porch, Sextoness Jane--called in for an extra half-day--was
ironing the white dresses to be worn that afternoon.And presently,
Patience, her basket quite full and stowed away in the trap waiting
before the side door, strolled around to interview her."Well, I was sort of calculating
on going over for a bit; Miss Shirley having laid particular stress on
my coming and this being the first reg'lar doings since I joined the
club.I told her and Pauline they mustn't look for me to go junketing
'round with them all the while, seeing I'm in office--so to speak--and
my time pretty well taken up with my work."I--"  Patience edged nearer the porch.Behind Jane stood the tall
clothes-horse, with its burden of freshly ironed white things.At
sight of a short, white frock, very crisp and immaculate, the blood
rushed to the child's face, then as quickly receded.--After all, it
would have had to be ironed for Sunday and--well, mother certainly had
been very non-committal the past few days--ever since that escapade
with Bedelia, in fact--regarding her youngest daughter's hopes and
fears for this all-important afternoon.And Patience had been wise
enough not to press the matter."But, oh, I do wonder if Hilary has--"  Patience went back to the side
porch.Hilary was there talking to Bedelia."You--you have fixed it
up?"Patience repressed a sudden desire to stamp her foot, and Hilary,
seeing the real doubt and longing in her face, relented."Mother wants
to see you, Patty.From the doorway, she looked back--"I just knew
you wouldn't go back on me, Hilary!I'll love you forever'n' ever."Pauline came out a moment later, drawing on her driving gloves."I
feel like a story-book girl, going driving this time in the morning, in
a trap like this.I wish you were coming, too, Hilary.""Oh, I'm like the delicate story-book girl, who has to rest, so as to
be ready for the dissipations that are to come later.I look the part,
don't I?"Pauline looked down into the laughing, sun-browned face."If Uncle
Paul were to see you now, he might find it hard to believe I
hadn't--exaggerated that time.""Well, it's your fault--and his, or was, in the beginning.You've a
fine basket of flowers to take; Patience has done herself proud this
morning.""It's wonderful how well that young lady can behave--at times."When I hear mother tell how like her you used to
be, I don't feel too discouraged about Patty.""That strikes me as rather a double-edged sort of speech," Pauline
gathered up the reins."Good-by, and don't get too tired."Shirley's turn was to be a combination studio tea and lawn-party, to
which all club members, both regular and honorary, not to mention their
relatives and friends, had been bidden.Following this, was to be a
high tea for the regular members."That's Senior's share," Shirley had explained to Pauline."He insists
that it's up to him to do something."Dayre was on very good terms with the "S. W. F.As for
Shirley, after the first, no one had ever thought of her as an outsider.It was hard now, Pauline thought, as she drove briskly along, the lake
breeze in her face, and the sound of Bedelia's quick trotting forming a
pleasant accompaniment to her, thoughts, very hard, to realize how soon
the summer would be over.But perhaps--as Hilary said--next summer
would mean the taking up again of this year's good times and
interests,--Shirley talked of coming back.As for the winter--Pauline
had in mind several plans for the winter.Those of the club members to
stay behind must get together some day and talk them over.One thing
was certain, the club motto must be lived up to bravely.If not in one
way, why in another.There must be no slipping back into the old
dreary rut and routine.It lay with themselves as to what their winter
should be."And there's fine sleighing here, Bedelia," she said."We'll get the
old cutter out and give it a coat of paint."Bedelia tossed her head, as if she heard in imagination the gay
jingling of the sleighbells."But, in the meantime, here is the manor," Pauline laughed, "and it's
the prettiest August day that ever was, and lawn-parties and such
festivities are afoot, not sleighing parties."The manor stood facing the lake with its back to the road, a broad
sloping lawn surrounded it on three sides, with the garden at the back.For so many seasons, it had stood lonely and neglected, that Pauline
never came near it now, without rejoicing afresh in its altered aspect.Even the sight of Betsy Todd's dish towels, drying on the currant
bushes at one side of the back door, added their touch to the sense of
pleasant, homely life that seemed to envelop the old house nowadays.Shirley came to the gate, as Pauline drew up, Phil, Pat and Pudgey in
close attention."I have to keep an eye on them," she told Pauline."They've just had their baths, and they're simply wild to get out in
the middle of the road and roll.I've told them no self-respecting dog
would wish to come to a lawn-party in anything but the freshest of
white coats, but I'm afraid they're not very self-respecting.""Patience is sure Towser's heart is heavy because he is not to come;
she has promised him a lawn-party on his own account, and that no
grown-ups shall be invited.She's sent you the promised flowers, and
hinted--more or less plainly--that she would have been quite willing to
deliver them in person."Oh, but I'm afraid you've robbed yourself!""The boys have been putting
the awning up."Dayre's fellow artists, who had come up a
day or two before, on a visit to the manor.One of them, at any rate,
deserved Shirley's title."Looks pretty nice,
doesn't it?"he said, with a wave of the hand towards the red and white
striped awning, placed at the further edge of the lawn.Shirley smiled her approval, and introduced him to Pauline, adding that
Miss Shaw was the real founder of their club."It's a might jolly sort of club, too," young Oram said."That is exactly what it has turned out to be," Pauline laughed."Are
the vases ready, Shirley?"Shirley brought the tray of empty flower vases out on the veranda, and
sent Harry Oram for a bucket of fresh water."Harry is to make the
salad," she explained to Pauline, as he came back."Before he leaves
the manor he will have developed into a fairly useful member of
society.""You've never eaten one of my salads, Miss Shaw," Harry said."When
you have, you'll think all your previous life an empty dream.""It's much more likely her later life will prove a nightmare,--for a
while, at least," Shirley declared."Still, Paul, Harry does make them
rather well.Betsy Todd, I am sorry to say, doesn't approve of him.But there are so many persons and things she doesn't approve of;
lawn-parties among the latter."Pauline nodded sympathetically; she knew Betsy Todd of old.Her wonder
was, that the Dayres had been able to put up with her so long, and she
said so."'Hobson's choice,'" Shirley answered, with a little shrug."She isn't
much like our old Therese at home, is she, Harry?But nothing would
tempt Therese away from her beloved New York.Nevaire have
I heard of zat place!'she told Harry, when he interviewed her for us.Senior's gone to Vergennes--on business thoughts intent, or I hope they
are.He's under strict orders not to 'discover a single bit' along the
way, and to get back as quickly as possible.""You see how beautifully she has us all in training?"Suddenly she looked up from her flowers with sobered
face."I wonder," she said slowly, "if you know what it's meant to
us--you're being here this summer, Shirley?Sometimes things do fit in
just right after all.It's helped out wonderfully this summer, having
you here and the manor open.""Pauline has a fairy-story uncle down in New York," Shirley turned to
Harry.I've met him, once or twice--he didn't strike me as
much of a believer in fairy tales.""He's made us believe in them," Pauline answered."I think Senior might have provided me with such a delightful sort of
uncle," Shirley observed."I told him so, but he says, while he's
awfully sorry I didn't mention it before, he's afraid it's too late
now.""Uncle Paul sent us Bedelia," Pauline told the rather perplexed-looking
Harry, "and the row-boat and the camera and--oh, other things.""Because he wanted them to have a nice, jolly summer," Shirley
explained."Pauline's sister had been sick and needed brightening up.""You don't think he's looking around for a nephew to adopt, do you?""A well-intentioned, intelligent young man--with no
end of talent.""For making salads," Shirley added with a sly smile."Oh, well, you know," Harry remarked casually, "these are what Senior
calls my'salad days.'"Whereupon Shirley rose without a word, carrying off her vases of
flowers.The party at the manor was, like all the club affairs, a decided
success.Never had the old place looked so gay and animated, since
those far-off days of its early glory.The young people coming and going--the girls in their light dresses and
bright ribbons made a pleasant place of the lawn, with its background
of shining water.The tennis court, at one side of the house, was one
of the favorite gathering spots; there were one or two boats out on the
lake.The pleasant informality of the whole affair proved its greatest
charm.Allen was there, pointing out to his host the supposed end of the
subterranean passage said to connect the point on which the manor stood
with the old ruined French fort over on the New York side.The
minister was having a quiet chat with the doctor, who had made a
special point of being there.Mothers of club members were exchanging
notes and congratulating each other on the good comradeship and general
air of contentment among the young people.Sextoness Jane was there,
in all the glory of her best dress--one of Mrs.Shaw's handed-down
summer ones--and with any amount of items picked up to carry home to
Tobias, who was certain to expect a full account of this most unusual
dissipation on his mistress's part.Even Betsy Todd condescended to
put on her black woolen--usually reserved for church and funerals--and
walk about among the other guests; but always, with an air that told
plainly how little she approved of such goings on.The Boyds were
there, their badges in full evidence.And last, though far from least,
in her own estimation, Patience was there, very crisp and white and on
her best behavior,--for, setting aside those conditions mother had seen
fit to burden her with, was the delightful fact that Shirley had asked
her to help serve tea.The principal tea-table was in the studio, though there was a second
one, presided over by Pauline and Bell, out under the awning at the
edge of the lawn.Patience thought the studio the very nicest room she had ever been in.It was long and low--in reality, the old dancing-hall, for the manor
had been built after the pattern of its first owner's English home; and
in the deep, recessed windows, facing the lake, many a bepatched and
powdered little belle of Colonial days had coquetted across her fan
with her bravely-clad partner.Dayre had thrown out an extra window at one end, at right angles to
the great stone fireplace, banked to-day with golden rod, thereby
securing the desired north light.On the easel, stood a nearly finished painting,--a sunny corner of the
old manor kitchen, with Betsy Todd in lilac print gown, peeling apples
by the open window, through which one caught a glimpse of the tall
hollyhocks in the garden beyond.Before this portrait, Patience found Sextoness Jane standing in mute
astonishment."Betsy looks like she was just going to say--'take your hands out of
the dish!'Betsy had once helped out
at the parsonage, during a brief illness of Miranda's, and the young
lady knew whereof she spoke."I'd never've thought," Jane said slowly, "that anyone'd get that fond
of Sister Todd--as to want a picture of her!""Oh, it's because she's such a character, you know," Patience explained
serenely.Jane was so good about letting one explain things."'A
perfect character,' I heard one of those artist men say so.""Not what I'd call a 'perfect'
character--not that I've got anything against Sister Todd; but she's
too fond of finding out a body's faults."Patience went off then in search of empty tea-cups.She was having a
beautiful time; at present only one cloud overshadowed her horizon.Already some tiresome folks were beginning to think about going.There
was the talk of chores to be done, suppers to get, and with the
breaking up, must come an end to her share in the party.For mother,
though approached in the most delicate fashion, had proved obdurate
regarding the further festivity to follow.Had mother been willing to
consider the matter, Patience would have cheerfully undertaken to
procure the necessary invitation.Shirley was a very obliging girl."And really, my dears," she said, addressing the three P's
collectively, "it does seem a pity to have to go home before the fun's
all over.And I could manage it--Bob would take me out rowing--if I
coaxed--he rows very slowly.I don't suppose, for one moment, that we
would get back in time.I believe--"  For fully three minutes,
Patience sat quite still in one of the studio window seats, oblivious
of the chatter going on all about her; then into her blue eyes came a
look not seen there very often--"No," she said sternly, shaking her
head at Phil, much to his surprise, for he wasn't doing anything."No--it wouldn't be _square_--and there would be the most awful to-do
afterwards."Shaw called to her to come, that
father was waiting, Patience responded with a very good grace.Dayre caught the wistful look in the child's face."Bless me," he said
heartily."You're not going to take Patience home with you, Mrs.Let her stay for the tea--the young people won't keep late hours, I
assure you.""Sometimes, I find it quite as well not to think things over," Mr."Why, dear me, I'd quite counted on Patience's being
here.You see, I'm not a regular member, either; and I want someone to
keep me in countenance."So presently, Hilary felt a hand slipped eagerly into hers."And oh, I
just love Mr.Then Patience went back to her window seat to play the delightful game
of "making believe" she hadn't stayed.She imagined that instead, she
was sitting between father and mother in the gig, bubbling over with
the desire to "hi-yi" at Fanny, picking her slow way along.The studio was empty, even the dogs were outside, speeding the parting
guests with more zeal than discretion.But after awhile Harry Oram
strolled in."You're an
artist, too, aren't you?""So kind of you to say so," Harry murmured."I have heard grave doubts
expressed on the subject by my too impartial friends.""I mean to be one when I grow up," Patience told him, "so's I can have
a room like this--with just rugs on the floor; rugs slide so
nicely--and window seats and things all cluttery.""May I come and have tea with you?"It'll be really tea--not pretend kind," Patience said."But I'll have
that sort for any children who may come.Hilary takes pictures--she
doesn't make them though.Harry glanced through the open doorway, to where
Hilary sat resting.She was "making" a picture now, he thought to
himself, in her white dress, under the big tree, her pretty hair
forming a frame about her thoughtful face.Taking a portfolio from a
table near by, he went out to where Hilary sat."Your small sister says you take pictures," he said, drawing a chair up
beside hers, "so I thought perhaps you'd let me show you these--they
were taken by a friend of mine.""Oh, but mine aren't anything like these!Hilary bent over the photographs he handed her; marveling over their
soft tones.They were mostly bits of landscape, with here and there a
water view and one or two fleecy cloud effects.It hardly seemed as
though they could be really photographs."I wish I
could--there are some beautiful views about here that would make
charming pictures.""She didn't in the beginning," Harry said, "She's lame; it was an
accident, but she can never be quite well again, so she took this up,
as an amusement at first, but now it's going to be her profession.""And you really think--anyone
could learn to do it?""No, not anyone; but I don't see why the right sort of person couldn't.""I wonder--if I could develop into the right sort.""May I come and see what you have done--and talk it over?""Since this friend of mine took it up, I'm ever so interested in camera
work."She had never thought of her camera
holding such possibilities within it, of its growing into something
better and more satisfying than a mere playmate of the moment.Supper was served on the lawn; the pleasantest, most informal, of
affairs, the presence of the older members of the party serving to turn
the gay give and take of the young folks into deeper and wider
channels, and Shirley's frequent though involuntary--"Do you remember,
Senior?"calling out more than one vivid bit of travel, of description
of places, known to most of them only through books.Later, down on the lower end of the lawn, with the moon making a path
of silver along the water, and the soft hush of the summer night over
everything, Shirley brought out her guitar, singing for them strange
folk-songs, picked up in her rambles with her father.Afterwards, the
whole party sang songs that they all knew, ending up at last with the
club song."'It's a habit to be happy,'" the fresh young voices chorused, sending
the tune far out across the lake; and presently, from a boat on its
further side, it was whistled back to them.Edna said,

"Give it up," Tom answered."Someone who's heard it--there've been
plenty of opportunities for folks to hear it.""Well it isn't a bad gospel to scatter broadcast," Bob remarked."And maybe it's someone who doesn't live about here, and he will go
away taking our tune with him, for other people to catch up," Hilary
suggested."But if he only has the tune and not the words," Josie objected, "what
use will that be?""The spirit of the words is in the tune," Pauline said."No one could
whistle or sing it and stay grumpy.""They'd have to 'put the frown away awhile, and try a little sunny
smile,' wouldn't they?"Patience had been a model of behavior all the evening.Mother would be
sure to ask if she had been good, when they got home.That was one of
those aggravating questions that only time could relieve her from.No
one ever asked Paul, or Hilary, that--when they'd been anywhere.Dayre had promised, the party broke up early, going off in the
various rigs they had come in.Tom and Josie went in the trap with the
Shaws."It's been perfectly lovely--all of it," Josie said, looking
back along the road they were leaving."Every good time we have seems
the best one yet.""You wait 'til my turn comes," Pauline told her."I've such a scheme
in my head."She was in front, between Tom, who was
driving, and Hilary, then she leaned forward, they were nearly home,
and the lights of the parsonage showed through the trees."There's a
light in the parlor--there's company!""And one up in our old room, Hilary.Goodness,
it must be a visiting minister!I didn't know father was expecting
anyone.""I just bet it
isn't any visiting minister--but a visiting--uncle!I feel it in my
bones, as Miranda says.""I feel it in my bones," Patience repeated."I just _knew_ Uncle Paul
would come up--a story-book uncle would be sure to.""Well, here we are," Tom laughed."You'll know for certain pretty
quick."CHAPTER X

THE END OF SUMMER

It was Uncle Paul, and perhaps no one
was more surprised at his unexpected coming,
than he himself.That snap-shot of Hilary's had considerable
to do with it; bringing home to him the
sudden realization of the passing of the years.For the first time, he had allowed himself to
face the fact that it was some time now since
he had crossed the summit of the hill, and that
under present conditions, his old age promised
to be a lonely, cheerless affair.He had never had much to do with young
people; but, all at once, it seemed to him that
it might prove worth his while to cultivate
the closer acquaintance of these nieces of his.Pauline, in particular, struck him as likely to
improve upon a nearer acquaintance.And
that afternoon, as he rode up Broadway, he
found himself wondering how she would
enjoy the ride; and all the sights and wonders
of the great city.Later, over his solitary dinner, he suddenly
decided to run up to Winton the next day.He would not wire them, he would rather like
to take Phil by surprise.So he had arrived at the parsonage,
driving up in Jed's solitary hack, and much plied
with information, general and personal, on the
way, just as the minister and his wife reached
home from the manor.Doesn't father look
tickled to death!"Patience declared, coming
in to her sisters' room that night, ostensibly
to have an obstinate knot untied, but inwardly
determined to make a third at the usual
bedtime talk for that once, at least.It wasn't
often they all came up together."He looks mighty glad," Pauline said."And isn't it funny, bearing him called
Phil?"Patience curled herself up in the
cozy corner."I never've thought of father
as Phil."Hilary paused in the braiding of her long
hair."I'm glad we've got to know him--Uncle
Paul, I mean--through his letters, and
all the lovely things he's done for us; else, I
think I'd have been very much afraid of him.""So am I," Pauline assented.Oram meant--he doesn't look as if
he believed much in fairy stories.But I like
his looks--he's so nice and tall and straight.""He used to have red hair, before it turned
gray," Hilary said, "so that must be a family
trait; your chin's like his, Paul, too,--so
square and determined.""You cut to bed, youngster," Pauline
commanded."You're losing all your beauty
sleep; and really, you know--"

Patience went to stand before the mirror."Maybe I ain't--pretty--yet; but I'm going
to be--some day.Dayre says he likes
red hair, I asked him.He says for me not to
worry; I'll have them all sitting up and taking notice yet."At which Pauline bore promptly down
upon her, escorting her in person to the door
of her own room."And you'd better get to
bed pretty quickly, too, Hilary," she advised,
coming back."You've had enough excitement for one day."Paul Shaw stayed a week; it was a
busy week for the parsonage folk and for
some other people besides.Before it was
over, the story-book uncle had come to know
his nieces and Winton fairly thoroughly;
while they, on their side, had grown very well
acquainted with the tall, rather silent man,
who had a fashion of suggesting the most
delightful things to do in the most matter-of-fact manner.There were one or two trips decidedly
outside that ten-mile limit, including an all day
sail up the lake, stopping for the night at a
hotel on the New York shore and returning
by the next day's boat.There was a visit to
Vergennes, which took in a round of the shops,
a concert, and another night away from home.Hilary
sighed blissfully one morning, as she and her
uncle waited on the porch for Bedelia and
the trap.Hilary was to drive him over to
The Maples for dinner."Or such a summer altogether," Pauline
added, from just inside the study window."I should think it has; we ought to be
eternally grateful to you for making us find
them out," Pauline declared.Shaw smiled, more as if to himself."I
daresay they're not all exhausted yet.""Perhaps," Hilary said slowly, "some
places are like some people, the longer and
better you know them, the more you keep
finding out in them to like.""Father says," Pauline suggested, "that one
finds, as a rule, what one is looking for.""Here we are," her uncle exclaimed, as
Patience appeared, driving Bedelia."Do you
know," he said, as he and Hilary turned out
into the wide village street, "I haven't seen the
schoolhouse yet?"It isn't
much of a building," Hilary answered."It is said to be a very good school for the
size of the place."Hilary turned Bedelia
up the little by-road, leading to the old
weather-beaten schoolhouse, standing back
from the road in an open space of bare ground.I would've been this June, if I
hadn't broken down last winter.""You will be able to go on this fall?"He says, if all his patients got on so
well, by not following his advice, he'd have
to shut up shop, but that, fortunately for
him, they haven't all got a wise uncle down in
New York, to offer counter-advice."Shaw remarked,
adding, "and Pauline considers herself through school?"I know she would like
to go on--but we've no higher school here and--She
read last winter, quite a little, with
father."Supposing you both had an opportunity--for
it must be both, or neither, I judge--and
the powers that be consented--how about
going away to school this winter?"she
cried, "you mean--"

"I have a trick of meaning what I say," her
uncle said, smiling at her."I wish I could say--what I want to--and
can't find words for--" Hilary said."We haven't consulted the higher authorities
yet, you know.""And--Oh, I don't see how mother could
get on without us, even if--"

"Mothers have a knack at getting along
without a good many things--when it means
helping their young folks on a bit,"
Mr."I'll have a talk with her
and your father to-night."That evening, pacing up and down the
front veranda with his brother, Mr.Shaw
said, with his customary abruptness, "You
seem to have fitted in here, Phil,--perhaps, you
were in the right of it, after all.I take it
you haven't had such a hard time, in some ways."Looking back nearly twenty years, he told
himself, that he did not regret that early
choice of his.He had fitted into the life here;
he and his people had grown together.It had
not always been smooth sailing and more than
once, especially the past year or so, his
narrow means had pressed him sorely, but on the
whole, he had found his lines cast in a
pleasant place, and was not disposed to rebel
against his heritage."Yes," he said, at last, "I have fitted in;
too easily, perhaps."Except in the accumulating of books," his
brother suggested."I have not been
able to give unlimited rein even to that mild
ambition.Fortunately, the rarer the
opportunity, the greater the pleasure it brings
with it--and the old books never lose their charm."Paul Shaw flicked the ashes from his
cigar."And the girls--you expect them to
fit in, too?"A note the elder
brother knew of old sounded in the younger
man's voice."Don't mount your high horse just yet,
Phil," he said."I'm not going to rub you up
the wrong way--at least, I don't mean to; but
you were always an uncommonly hard chap to
handle--in some matters.I grant you, it is
their home and not a had sort of home for a
girl to grow up in."Shaw stood for a
moment at the head of the steps, looking off
down the peaceful, shadowy street.It had
been a pleasant week; he had enjoyed it
wonderfully.Already the city
was calling to him; he was homesick for its
rush and bustle, the sense of life and movement."You and I stand as far apart to-day, in
some matters, Phil, as we did twenty--thirty
years ago," he said presently, "and that eldest
daughter of yours--I'm a fair hand at reading
character or I shouldn't be where I am to-day,
if I were not--is more like me than you.""So I have come to think--lately.""That second girl takes after you; she
would never have written that letter to me
last May.""No, Hilary would not have at the time--"

"Oh, I can guess how you felt about it at
the time.But, look here, Phil, you've got
over that--surely?After all, I like to think
now that Pauline only hurried on the
inevitable."Paul Shaw laid his hand on the
minister's shoulder."Nearly twenty years is
a pretty big piece out of a lifetime.I see now
how much I have been losing all these years.""It has been a long time, Paul; and,
perhaps, I have been to blame in not trying more
persistently to heal the breach between us.I
assure you that I have regretted it daily.""You always did have a lot more pride in
your make-up than a man of your profession
has any right to allow himself, Phil.But if
you like, I'm prepared to point out to you
right now how you can make it up to me.Here comes Lady Shaw and we won't
waste time getting to business."That night, as Pauline and Hilary were in
their own room, busily discussing, for by no
means the first time that day, what Uncle Paul
had said to Hilary that morning, and just
how he had looked, when he said it, and was
it at all possible that father would consent,
and so on, _ad libitum_, their mother tapped at the door."That is how you take it," Mrs.She was glad, very glad, that this
unforeseen opportunity should be given her
daughters; and yet--it meant the first break
in the home circle, the first leaving home for them."I'll try and run up for a day or two, before
the girls go to school," he promised his
sister-in-law."Let me know, as soon as you have
decided _where_ to send them."Patience was divided in her opinion, as to
this new plan.It would be lonesome without
Paul and Hilary; but then, for the time
being, she would be, to all intents and purposes,
"Miss Shaw."Also, Bedelia was not going
to boarding-school--on the whole, the
arrangement had its advantages.Of course,
later, she would have her turn at school--Patience
meant to devote a good deal of her
winter's reading to boarding-school stories.She told Sextoness Jane so, when that
person appeared, just before supper time."A lot of things
keep happening to you folks right along," she
observed."Nothing's ever happened to me,
'cept mumps--and things of that sort; you
wouldn't call them interesting."They're 'round on the porch, looking at
some photos Mr.Oram's brought over; and
he's looking at Hilary's.Hilary's going in
for some other kind of picture taking.I wish
she'd leave her camera home, when she goes to
school.Do you want to speak to them about
anything particular?""I'll wait a bit," Jane sat down on the
garden-bench beside Patience.the latter said, as the
front gate clicked a few moments later.she called, "You're wanted, Paul!""You and Hilary going to be busy
tonight?"Jane asked, as Pauline came across
the lawn."Well," Jane said, "it ain't prayer-meeting
night, and it ain't young peoples' night and it
ain't choir practice night, so I thought maybe
you'd like me to take my turn at showing you
something.Not all the club--like's not they
wouldn't care for it, but if you think they
would, why, you can show it to them sometime.""So can I--if you tell mother you want me
to," Patience put in."A good two miles--we'd best walk--we
can rest after we get there.Maybe, if you
like, you'd better ask Tom and Josie.Your
ma'll be better satisfied if he goes along, I
reckon.I'll come for you at about half-past
seven.""All right, thank you ever so much," Pauline
said, and went to tell Hilary, closely
pursued by Patience.Shaw
vetoed Pauline's proposition that Patience
should make one of the party."Not every time, my dear," she explained.Promptly at half-past seven Jane
appeared.she said, as the four
young people came to meet her."You don't
want to go expecting anything out of the
common.Like's not, you've all seen it a heap
of times, but maybe not to take particular
notice of it."She led the way through the garden to the
lane running past her cottage, where Tobias
sat in solitary dignity on the doorstep, down
the lane to where it merged in to what was
nothing more than a field path."But not out on the water," Josie said."You're taking us too far below the pier for that.""It'll be on the water--what
you're going to see," she was getting
a good deal of pleasure out of her small
mystery, and when they reached the low shore,
fringed with the tall sea-grass, she took her
party a few steps along it to where an old log
lay a little back from the water."I reckon
we'll have to wait a bit," she said, "but it'll
be 'long directly."They sat down in a row, the young people
rather mystified.Apparently the broad
expanse of almost motionless water was quite
deserted.There was a light breeze blowing
and the soft swishing of the tiny waves against
the bank was the only sound to break the
stillness; the sky above the long irregular range
of mountains on the New York side, still wore
its sunset colors, the lake below sending hack
a faint reflection of them.But presently these faded until only the
afterglow was left, to merge in turn into the
soft summer twilight, through which the stars
began to glimpse, one by one.The little group had been mostly silent,
each busy with his or her thoughts; so far as
the young people were concerned, happy
thoughts enough; for if the closing of each
day brought their summer nearer to its
ending, the fall would bring with it new
experiences, an entering of new scenes.Sextoness Jane broke the silence,
pointing up the lake, to where a tiny point of
red showed like a low-hung star through the
gathering darkness.Moment by moment,
other lights came into view, silently, steadily,
until it seemed like some long, gliding
sea-serpent, creeping down towards them through
the night.They had all seen it, times without number,
before.The long line of canal boats being
towed down the lake to the canal below; the
red lanterns at either end of each boat
showing as they came.But to-night, infected
perhaps, by the pride, the evident delight, in
Jane's voice, the old familiar sight held them
with the new interest the past months had
brought to bear upon so many old, familiar things."It is--wonderful," Pauline said at last."It might be a scene from--fairyland, almost.""Me--I love to see them come stealing long
like that through the dark," Jane said slowly
and a little hesitatingly.It was odd to be
telling confidences to anyone except Tobias."I don't know where they come from, nor
where they're a-going to.Many's the night
I walk over here just on the chance of seeing
one.Mostly, this time of year, you're pretty
likely to catch one.When I was younger, I
used to sit and fancy myself going aboard on
one of them and setting off for strange parts.I wasn't looking to settle down here in Winton
all my days; but I reckon, maybe, it's just's
well--anyhow, when I got the freedom to
travel, I'd got out of the notion of it--and
perhaps, there's no telling, I might have been
terribly disappointed.And there ain't any
hindrance 'gainst my setting off--in my own
mind--every time I sits here and watches a
tow go down the lake.I've seen a heap of
big churches in my travels--it's mostly easier
'magining about them--churches are pretty
much alike I reckon, though I ain't seen many, I'll admit."No one answered for a moment, but Jane,
used to Tobias for a listener, did not mind.Then in the darkness, Hilary laid a hand
softly over the work-worn ones clasped on
Jane's lap.It was hard to imagine Jane
young and full of youthful fancies and
longings; yet years ago there had been a Jane--not
Sextoness Jane then--who had found
Winton dull and dreary and had longed to get
away.But for her, there had been no one to
wave the magic wand, that should transform
the little Vermont village into a place filled
with new and unexplored charms.Never in
all Jane's many summers, had she known one
like this summer of theirs; and for them--the
wonder was by no means over--the years
ahead were bright with untold possibilities.Hilary sighed for very happiness, wondering
if she were the same girl who had rocked
listlessly in the hammock that June morning,
protesting that she didn't care for "half-way" things."I'm ever so glad we came, thank you so
much, Jane," Pauline said heartily."I wonder what'll have happened by the
time we all see our next tow go down," Josie
said, as they started towards home."We may see a good many more than one
before the general exodus," her brother answered."But we won't have time to come watch for
them.Oh, Paul, just think, only a little
while now--"

Tom slipped into step with Hilary, a little
behind the others."I never supposed the old
soul had it in her," he said, glancing to where
Jane trudged heavily on ahead."Still, I
suppose she was young--once; though I've never
thought of her being so before.""I wonder,--maybe,
she's been better off, after all, right, here at
home.She wouldn't have got to be
Sextoness Jane anywhere else, probably.""Is there a
hidden meaning--subject to be carefully avoided?""So you and Paul are off on your travels, too?""Yes, though I can hardly believe it yet.""And just as glad to go as any of us.""Oh, but we're coming back--after we've
been taught all manner of necessary things.""Edna'll be the only one of you girls left
behind; it's rough on her.""It certainly is; we'll all have to write her
heaps of letters.""Much time there'll be for letter-writing,
outside of the home ones," Tom said."Speaking of time," Josie turned towards
them, "we're going to be busier than any bee
ever dreamed of being, before or since Dr.They certainly were busy days that
followed.So many of the young folks were
going off that fall that a good many of the
meetings of "The S. W. F. Club" resolved
themselves into sewing-bees, for the girl members only."If we'd known how jolly they were, we'd
have tried them before," Bell declared one
morning, dropping down on the rug Pauline
had spread under the trees at one end of the
parsonage lawn.Patience, pulling bastings with a business-like
air, nodded her curly head wisely."Miranda says,
folks mostly get 'round to enjoying
their blessings 'bout the time they come to lose them.""Has the all-important question been
settled yet, Paul?"Edna asked, looking up from
her work.She might not be going away to
school, but even so, that did not debar one
from new fall clothes at home."They're coming to Vergennes with me,"
Bell said."Then we can all come home
together Friday nights.""They're coming to Boston with me," Josie
corrected, "then we'll be back together for
Thanksgiving."Shirley, meekly taking her first sewing
lessons under Pauline's instructions, and frankly
declaring that she didn't at all like them,
dropped the hem she was turning."They're
coming to New York with me; and in the
between-times we'll have such fun that they'll
never want to come home.""It looks as though
Hilary and I would have a busy winter
between you all.It is a comfort to know where
we are going."she warned, when later the
party broke up."Are we going out in a blaze of glory?""You might tell us where we are going,
now, Paul," Josie urged."You wait until
Friday, like good little girls.Mind, you all
bring wraps; it'll be chilly coming home."Pauline's turn was to be the final wind-up
of the club's regular outings.No one outside
the home folks, excepting Tom, had been
taken into her confidence--it had been
necessary to press him into service.And when, on
Friday afternoon, the young people gathered
at the parsonage, all but those named were
still in the dark.Allen, Harry Oram and Patience
were there; the minister and Dr.Brice
had promised to join the party later if possible.As a rule, the club picnics were cooperative
affairs; but to-day the members, by special
request, arrived empty-handed.Paul
Shaw, learning that Pauline's turn was yet to
come, had insisted on having a share in it."I am greatly interested in this club," he
had explained."I like results, and I think,"
he glanced at Hilary's bright happy face,
"that the 'S.W. F. Club' has achieved at least
one very good result."And on the morning before the eventful
Friday, a hamper had arrived from New
York, the watching of the unpacking of which
had again transformed Patience, for the time,
from an interrogation to an exclamation point."It's a beautiful hamper," she explained to
Towser."It truly is--because father says,
it's the inner, not the outer, self that makes
for real beauty, or ugliness; and it certainly
was the inside of that hamper that counted.I wish you were going, Towser.See here,
suppose you follow on kind of quietly
to-morrow afternoon--don't show up too soon, and
I guess I can manage it."Which piece of advice Towser must have
understood.At any rate, he acted upon it to
the best of his ability, following the party at a
discreet distance through the garden and down
the road towards the lake; and only when the
halt at the pier came, did he venture near, the
most insinuating of dogs.And so successfully did Patience manage
it, that when the last boat-load pushed off
from shore, Towser sat erect on the narrow
bow seat, blandly surveying his fellow
voyagers."He does so love picnics," Patience
explained to Mr.Dayre, "and this is
the last particular one for the season.I kind
of thought he'd go along and I slipped in a
little paper of bones.""We're out on the wide ocean sailing.""I wish we
were--the water's quiet as a mill-pond this afternoon."For the great lake, appreciating perhaps
the importance of the occasion, had of its many
moods chosen to wear this afternoon its
sweetest, most beguiling one, and lay, a broad
stretch of sparkling, rippling water, between
its curving shores.Beyond, the range of mountains rose dark
and somber against the cloud-flecked sky,
their tops softened by the light haze that told
of coming autumn.And presently, from boat to boat, went the
call, "We're going to Port Edward!"But that's not _in_ Winton," Edna protested."Of it, if not in it," Jack Ward assured them."Do you reckon you can show us anything
new about that old fort, Paul Shaw?""Why, I could go all over it
blindfolded.""Not to show the new--to unfold the old,"
Pauline told him."It is--in substance," Pauline looked across
her shoulder to where Mr.Allen sat,
imparting information to Harry Oram."So that's why you asked the old fellow,"
Tracy said.They were rounding the slender point on
which the tall, white lighthouse stood, and
entering the little cove where visitors to the fort
usually beached their boats.A few rods farther inland, rose the tall,
grass-covered, circular embankment,
surrounding the crumbling, gray walls, the outer
shells of the old barracks.At the entrance to the enclosure, Tom
suddenly stepped ahead, barring the way."No
passing within this fort without the
counter-sign," he declared."'It's a
habit to be happy,'" she suggested, and Tom
drew back for her to enter.But one by one,
he exacted the password from each.Inside, within the shade of those old, gray
walls, a camp-fire had been built and
camp-kettle swung, hammocks had been hung under
the trees and when cushions were scattered
here and there the one-time fort bore anything
but a martial air.But something of the spirit of the past must
have been in the air that afternoon, or perhaps,
the spirit of the coming changes; for this
picnic--though by no means lacking in charm--was
not as gay and filled with light-hearted
chaff as usual.There was more talking in
quiet groups, or really serious searching for
some trace of those long-ago days of storm and stress.With the coming of evening, the fire was
lighted and the cloth laid within range of its
flickering shadows.The night breeze had
sprung up and from outside the sloping
embankment they caught the sound of the waves
breaking on the beach.True to their
promise, the minister and Dr.Brice appeared at
the time appointed and were eagerly welcomed
by the young people.Supper was a long, delightful affair that
night, with much talk of the days when the
fort had been devoted to far other purposes
than the present; and the young people,
listening to the tales Mr.Allen told in his quiet yet
strangely vivid way, seemed to hear the slow
creeping on of the boats outside and to be
listening in the pauses of the wind for the
approach of the enemy."I'll take it back, Paul," Tracy told her, as
they were repacking the baskets."Even the
old fort has developed new interests."W. F. Club' will
continue its good work," Jack said.Going back, Pauline found herself sitting
in the stern of one of the boats, beside her
father.The club members were singing the
club song.But Pauline's thoughts had
suddenly gone back to that wet May afternoon.She could see the dreary, rain-swept garden,
hear the beating of the drops on the
window-panes.How long ago and remote it all
seemed; how far from the hopeless discontent,
the vague longings, the real anxiety of that
time, she and Hilary had traveled."There's one thing,"
she said, "we've had one summer that I shall
always feel would be worth reliving.And
we're going to have more of them.""I am glad to hear that," Mr.Pauline looked about her--the lanterns at
the ends of the boats threw dancing lights out
across the water, no longer quiet; overhead,
the sky was bright with stars."Everything
is so beautiful," the girl said slowly."One
seems to feel it more--every day.""'The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the
Lord hath made even both of them,'" her
father quoted gravely."The
hearing ear and the seeing eye"--it was a good
thought to take with them--out into the new
life, among the new scenes.One would need
them everywhere--out in the world, as well as
in Winton.And then, from the boat just
ahead, sounded Patience's clear
treble,--"'There's a Good Time Coming.'"Come now, own up, you are beginning to take this thing as a matter of
course."But Cameron stood with his back to the light, busying himself with his
fishing tackle and fish, and ignoring the Inspector's cheerful chatter.And thus he remained without a word while the Inspector talked on in a
voluble flow of small talk quite unusual with him.Throughout the supper Cameron remained silent, rallying spasmodically
with gay banter to the Inspector's chatter, or answering at random, but
always falling silent again, and altogether was so unlike himself that
Mandy fell to wondering, then became watchful, then anxious.At length
the Inspector himself fell silent, as if perceiving the uselessness of
further pretense.said Mandy quietly, when silence had fallen upon
them all."Tell her, for God's sake," said her husband to the Inspector."From Superintendent Strong to my Chief," he said.She took it and as she read her face went now white with fear, now red
with indignation."What a man he is to be sure!""And what nonsense
is this he writes.With all his men and officers he must come for my
husband!It's just his own stupid
stubbornness.His boyish face, for
he was but a lad, seemed to have grown old in those few minutes.The
Inspector wore an ashamed look, as if detected in a crime."And because he is not clever enough to catch this man they must come
for my husband to do it for them.He has nothing
to do with the Force."And still the Inspector sat silent, as if convicted of both crime and
folly.You quite see how
impossible it is.""Most certainly you can't," eagerly agreed the Inspector."I knew from
the first it was a piece of--sheer absurdity--in fact brutal inhumanity."It isn't as if I was really needed, you know.The Superintendent's idea
is, as you say, quite absurd.""You don't think for a moment," continued Cameron, "there is any
need--any real need I mean--for me to--" Cameron's voice died away."Well--of course, we
are desperately short-handed, you know.Every
reserve has to be closely patroled.We ought to have a thousand men instead
of five hundred, this very minute.The
chances are this will all blow over.""We've heard these rumors for the past year.""Of course," agreed the Inspector cheerfully."But if it does not," asked Mandy, suddenly facing the Inspector, "what
then?"The Inspector appeared to turn the matter over in his mind."Well," he said slowly and thoughtfully, "if it does not there will be a
deuce of an ugly time."But Mandy waited, her eyes fixed
on his face demanding answer."Well, there are some hundreds of settlers and their families scattered
over this country, and we can hardly protect them all.But," he added
cheerfully, as if dismissing the subject, "we have a trick of worrying
through."One phrase in the Superintendent's letter to the
Commissioner which she had just read kept hammering upon her brain,
"Cameron is the man and the only man for the job."They turned the talk to other things, but the subject would not be
dismissed.Like the ghost at the feast it kept ever returning.The
Inspector retailed the most recent rumors, and together he and his host
weighed their worth.The Inspector disclosed the Commissioner's plans
as far as he knew them.These, too, were discussed with approval or
condemnation.The consequences of an Indian uprising were hinted at, but
quickly dropped.The probabilities of such an uprising were touched upon
and pronounced somewhat slight.But somehow to the woman listening as in a maze this pronouncement and
all the reassuring talk rang hollow.She sat staring at the Inspector
with eyes that saw him not.What she did see was a picture out of an
old book of Indian war days which she had read when a child, a smoking
cabin, with mangled forms of women and children lying in the blackened
embers.By degrees, slow, painful, but relentlessly progressive, certain
impressions, at first vague and passionately resisted, were wrought into
convictions in her soul.First, the Inspector, in spite of his light
talk, was undeniably anxious, and in this anxiety her husband shared.Then, the Force was clearly inadequate to the duty required of it.Why should it be that a Government should
ask of brave men what they must know to be impossible?Hard upon this
conviction came the words of the Superintendent, "Cameron is the man and
the only man for the job."Finally, the Inspector was apologizing for
her husband.It roused a hot resentment in her to hear him.That thing
she could not and would not bear.Never should it be said that her
husband had needed a friend to apologize for him.As these convictions grew in clearness she found herself brought
suddenly and sharply to face the issue.With a swift contraction of the
heart she realized that she must send her husband on this perilous duty.It was as if a cold hand were steadily squeezing
drop by drop the life-blood from her heart.In contrast, and as if with
one flash of light, the long happy days of the last six months passed
before her mind.Her breathing came in short
gasps, her lips became dry, her eyes fixed and staring.She was fighting
for what was dearer to her than life.Suddenly she flung her hands to
her face and groaned aloud.cried her husband, starting from his place.The agonizing agitation passed from her
and a great quiet fell upon her soul.She had
made the ancient sacrifice demanded of women since ever the first man
went forth to war.It remained only to complete with fitting ritual this
ancient sacrifice.She rose from her seat and faced her husband."Allan," she said, and her voice was of indescribable sweetness, "you
must go."Her husband took her in his arms without a word, then brokenly he said:

"My girl!"Yes," she replied, gazing into his face with a wan smile, "I knew it
too, because I knew you would expect me to."The Inspector had risen from his chair at her first cry and was standing
with bent head, as if in the presence of a scene too sacred to witness.Then he came to her, and, with old time and courtly grace of the fine
gentleman he was, he took her hand and raised it to his lips."Dear lady," he said, "for such as you brave men would gladly give their
lives.""I would much rather they would save
them.But," she added, her voice taking a practical tone, "sit down and
let us talk.Now what's the work and what's the plan?"The men glanced at each other in silent admiration of this woman who,
without moan or murmur, could surrender her heart's dearest treasure for
her country's good.They sat down before the fire and discussed the business before them.But as they discussed ever and again Mandy would find her mind wandering
back over the past happy days.Ever and again a word would recall her,
but only for a brief moment and soon she was far away again.A phrase of the Inspector, however, arrested and held her."He's really a fine looking Indian, in short a kind of aristocrat among
the Indians," he was saying.she exclaimed, remembering her own word about the
Indian Chief they had met that very evening."Why, that is like our
Chief, Allan.""What's your man like,
again?"The very man we saw to-night!"cried Mandy, and gave her description of
the "Big Chief."When she had finished the Inspector sat looking into the fire."Among the Piegans, too," he mused.There was a big
powwow the other day in the Sun Dance Canyon.The Piegans' is the
nearest reserve, and a lot of them were there.The Superintendent says
he is somewhere along the Sun Dance.""Inspector," said Allan, with sudden determination, "we will drop in on
the Piegans to-morrow morning by sun-up."This pace was more rapid than she had expected, but,
having made the sacrifice, there was with her no word of recall."Well," he said, "it would do no harm to reconnoiter at any rate.But we
can't afford to make any false move, and we can't afford to fail."And the
lines in his face reminded his wife of how he looked that night three
years before when he cowed the great bully Perkins into submission at
her father's door.As the Inspector said, there must be no
failure; hence the plan must provide for every possible contingency.By
far the keenest of the three in mental activity was Mandy.By a curious
psychological process the Indian Chief, who an hour before had awakened
in her admiration and a certain romantic interest, had in a single
moment become an object of loathing, almost of hatred.That he should be
in this land planning for her people, for innocent and defenseless women
and children, the horrors of massacre filled her with a fierce anger.But a deeper analysis would doubtless have revealed a personal element
in her anger and loathing.The Indian had become the enemy for whose
capture and for whose destruction her husband was now enlisted.Deep
down in her quiet, strong, self-controlled nature there burned a passion
in which mingled the primitive animal instincts of the female, mate for
mate, and mother for offspring.Already her mind had leaped forward to
the moment when this cunning, powerful plotter would be at death-grips
with her husband and she not there to help.With intensity of purpose
and relentlessness of determination she focused the powers of her
forceful and practical mind upon the problem engaging their thought.With mind whetted to its keenest she listened to the men as they made
and unmade their plans.In ordinary circumstances the procedure of
arrest would have been extremely simple.The Inspector and Cameron would
have ridden into the Piegan camp, and, demanding their man, would have
quietly and without even a show of violence carried him off.It would
have been like things they had each of them done single-handed within
the past year."When once we make a start, you see, Mrs.We could not afford to," said the Inspector.There was no suspicion
of boasting in the Inspector's voice.He was simply enunciating the
traditional code of the Police."And if we should hesitate with this
man or fail to land him every Indian in these territories would have
it within a week and our prestige would receive a shock.We dare not
exhibit any sign of nerves.On the other hand we dare not make any
movement in force."I quite see," replied Mandy with keen appreciation of the delicacy of
the situation."So that I fancy the simpler the plan the better.Cameron will ride
into the Piegan camp inquiring about his cattle, as, fortunately for the
present situation, he has cause enough to in quite an ordinary way.I drop in on my regular patrol looking up a cattle-thief in quite the
ordinary way.Seeing this strange chief, I arrest him on suspicion.Luckily Trotting Wolf, who is
the Head Chief now of the Piegans, has a fairly thorough respect for
the Police, and unless things have gone much farther in his band than I
think he will not resist."I don't like your plan at all, Inspector," said Mandy promptly."The
moment you suggest arrest that moment the younger men will be up.They
are just back from a big brave-making powwow, you say.They are all
worked up, and keen for a chance to prove that they are braves in more
than in name.You give them the very opportunity you wish to avoid.Now hear my plan," she continued, her voice eager, keen, hard, in the
intensity of her purpose."I ride into camp to-morrow morning to see
the sick boy.I promised I would and I really want to.I find him in a
fever, for a fever he certainly will have.I dress his wounded ankle and
discover he must have some medicine.I get old Copperhead to ride back
with me for it.The two men looked at each other, then at her, with a gentle admiring
pity.The plan was simplicity itself and undoubtedly eliminated the
elements of danger which the Inspector's possessed.It had, however, one
fatal defect.said her husband, reaching across the table and patting
her hand that lay clenched upon the cloth."We do not use our women as decoys in this country, nor do we expose
them to dangers we men dare not face.""Allan," cried his wife with angry impatience, "you miss the whole
point.For a woman to ride into the Piegan camp, especially on this
errand of mercy, involves her in no danger.And what possible danger
would there be in having the old villain ride back with me for
medicine?And as to the decoy business," here she shrugged her shoulders
contemptuously, "do you think I care a bit for that?Isn't he planning
to kill women and children in this country?And--and--won't he do his
best to kill you?""Isn't it right for me to prevent him?I would--would--gladly kill
him--myself."As she spoke these words her eyes were indeed, in Sergeant
Ferry's words, "like little blue flames."To their manhood the plan
was repugnant, and in spite of Mandy's arguments and entreaties was
rejected.Cameron," said the Inspector kindly, "but
we cannot, you must see we cannot, adopt it.""You mean you will not," cried Mandy indignantly, "just because you are
stupid stubborn men!"And she proceeded to argue the matter all over
again with convincing logic, but with the same result.There are
propositions which do not lend themselves to the arbitrament of logic
with men.When the safety of their women is at stake they refuse to
discuss chances.In such a case they may be stupid, but they are quite
immovable.Blocked by this immovable stupidity, Mandy yielded her ground, but only
to attempt a flank movement."Let me go with you on your reconnoitering expedition," she pleaded."Rather, let US go, Allan, you and I together, to see the boy.He can't help his father, can he?""Quite true," said the Inspector gravely."Let us go and find out all we can and next day make your attempt.Besides, Allan," she cried under a sudden inspiration of memory, "you
can't possibly go.You forget your sister arrives at Calgary this week.I had forgotten," said Cameron, turning to study
the calendar on the wall, a gorgeous work of art produced out of
the surplus revenues of a Life Insurance Company."Let's see," he
calculated.That gives us two days clear for this job.I feel
like making this try, Mandy," he continued earnestly."We have this chap
practically within our grasp.The Piegans are not
yet worked up to the point of resistance.Ten days from now our man may
be we can't tell where."The ritual of her sacrifice was not yet complete."I think you are right, Allan," at length she said slowly with a twisted
smile.It's hard not to be in it, though.But," she added, as if moved by a sudden thought, "I may be in it yet.""You will certainly be with us in spirit, Mandy," he replied, patting
the firm brown hand that lay upon the table."Yes, truly, and in our hearts," added the Inspector with a bow.Already she was turning over in her mind a
half-formed plan which she had no intention of sharing with these men,
who, after the manner of their kind, would doubtless block it.Early morning found Cameron and the Inspector on the trail toward the
Piegan Reserve, riding easily, for they knew not what lay before them
nor what demand they might have to make upon their horses that day.The
Inspector rode a strongly built, stocky horse of no great speed but good
for an all-day run.Cameron's horse was a broncho, an unlovely
brute, awkward and ginger---his name was Ginger--sad-eyed
and wicked-looking, but short-coupled and with flat, rangy legs that
promised speed.For his sad-eyed, awkward broncho Cameron professed a
deep affection and defended him stoutly against the Inspector's jibes."You can't kill him," he declared."He'll go till he drops, and then
twelve miles more.He isn't beautiful to look at and his manners are
nothing to boast of, but he will hang upon the fence the handsome skin
of that cob of yours."When still five or six miles from camp they separated."The old boy may, of course, be gone," said the Inspector as he was
parting from his friend."By Superintendent Strong's report he seems to
be continually on the move.""I rather think his son will hold him for a day or two," replied
Cameron."Now you give me a full half hour.I shall look in upon the
boy, you know.I don't as a rule linger among these
Piegan gentry, you know, and a lengthened stay would certainly arouse
suspicion."Cameron's way lay along the high plateau, from which a descent could
be made by a trail leading straight south into the Piegan camp.The
Inspector's course carried him in a long detour to the left, by which
he should enter from the eastern end the valley in which lay the Indian
camp.Cameron's trail at the first took him through thick timber, then,
as it approached the level floor of the valley, through country that
became more open.The trees were larger and with less undergrowth
between them.In the valley itself a few stubble fields with fences
sadly in need of repair gave evidence of the partial success of the
attempts of the farm instructor to initiate the Piegans into the science
and art of agriculture.A few scattering log houses, which the Indians
had been induced by the Government to build for themselves, could be
seen here and there among the trees.But during the long summer days,
and indeed until driven from the open by the blizzards of winter, not
one of these children of the free air and open sky could be persuaded to
enter the dismal shelter afforded by the log houses.They much preferred
the flimsy teepee or tent.Their methods of sanitation
did not comport with a permanent dwelling.When the teepee grew foul,
which their habits made inevitable, a simple and satisfactory remedy
was discovered in a shift to another camp-ground.Not so with the log
houses, whose foul corners, littered with the accumulated filth of a
winter's occupation, became fertile breeding places for the germs of
disease and death.Irregularly strewn upon the grassy plain in
the valley bottom some two dozen teepees marked the Piegan summer
headquarters.Above the camp rose the smoke of their camp-fires, for it
was still early and their morning meal was yet in preparation.CHAPTER VI

THE ILLUSIVE COPPERHEAD


Cameron's approach to the Piegan camp was greeted by a discordant
chorus of yelps and howls from a pack of mangy, half-starved curs of all
breeds, shapes and sizes, the invariable and inevitable concomitants of
an Indian encampment.The squaws, who had been busy superintending the
pots and pans in which simmered the morning meal of their lords and
masters, faded from view at Cameron's approach, and from the teepees on
every side men appeared and stood awaiting with stolid faces the white
man's greeting.he cried briefly, singling out the Chief.replied the Chief, and awaited further parley."I say, Chief," continued Cameron, "I have lost a couple of steers--big
fellows, too--any of your fellows seen them?"Trotting Wolf turned to the group of Indians who had slouched toward
them in the meantime and spoke to them in the singsong monotone of the
Indian.Cameron threw himself from his horse and, striding to a large pot
simmering over a fire, stuck his knife into the mass and lifted up a
large piece of flesh, the bones of which looked uncommonly like ribs of
beef."What's this, Trotting Wolf?"he inquired with a stern ring in his
voice."Deer," promptly and curtly replied the Chief.The Chief consulted the group of Indians standing near."This man," he replied, indicating a young Indian."Oh, come now, you know English all right.Still the Indian shook his head, meeting Cameron's look with a fearless
eye.replied Trotting Wolf, while a smile appeared on several faces."I thought you could speak English all right."Again a smile touched the faces of some of the group.inquired Cameron, holding up his
fingers.grunted the Indian, holding up five fingers.Big deer, too," said Cameron, pointing to the ribs."How did he carry him these five miles?"continued Cameron, turning to
Trotting Wolf."Pony," replied Trotting Wolf curtly."Now," said he, turning swiftly upon the young
Indian, "where is the skin?"The Indian's eyes wavered for a fleeting instant.He spoke a few words
to Trotting Wolf.Again the Indian's eyes wavered and again the conversation followed."Left him up in bush," replied the chief."We will ride up and see it, then," said Cameron.Cameron raised the meat to his nose, sniffed its odor and dropped it
back into the pot.With a single stride he was close to White Cloud."White Cloud," he said sternly, "you speak with a forked tongue.In
plain English, White Cloud, you lie.Trotting Wolf, you know that is no
deer."No see cow me," he said sullenly."White Cloud," said Cameron, swiftly turning again upon the young
Indian, "where did you shoot my cow?"The young Indian stared back at Cameron, never blinking an eyelid.Cameron felt his wrath rising, but kept himself well in hand,
remembering the purpose of his visit.During this conversation he had
been searching the gathering crowd of Indians for the tall form of his
friend of the previous night, but he was nowhere to be seen.Cameron
felt he must continue the conversation, and, raising his voice as if in
anger--and indeed there was no need of pretense for he longed to seize
White Cloud by the throat and shake the truth out of him--he said:

"Trotting Wolf, your young men have been killing my cattle for many
days.You know that this is a serious offense with the Police.The Police will ask why you cannot keep your
young men from stealing cattle."The number of Indians was increasing every moment and still Cameron's
eyes searched the group, but in vain.Murmurs arose from the Indians,
which he easily interpreted to mean resentment, but he paid no heed."The Police do not want a Chief," he cried in a still louder voice, "who
cannot control his young men and keep them from breaking the law."From behind a teepee some distance away there
appeared the figure of the "Big Chief" whom he so greatly desired to
see.Giving no sign of his discovery, he continued his exhortation to
Trotting Wolf, to that worthy's mingled rage and embarrassment.The
suggestion of jail for cattle-thieves the Chief knew well was no empty
threat, for two of his band even at that moment were in prison for this
very crime.He had no desire himself
to undergo a like experience, and it irked his tribe and made them
restless and impatient of his control that their Chief could not protect
them from these unhappy consequences of their misdeeds.They knew
that with old Crowfoot, the Chief of the Blackfeet band, such untoward
consequences rarely befell the members of that tribe.Already Trotting
Wolf could distinguish the murmurs of his young men, who were resenting
the charge against White Cloud, as well as the tone and manner in
which it was delivered.Most gladly would he have defied this truculent
rancher to do his worst, but his courage was not equal to the plunge,
and, besides, the circumstances for such a break were not yet favorable.At this juncture Cameron, facing about, saw within a few feet of him the
Indian whose capture he was enlisted to secure."Good," said the Indian with grave dignity."He sick here," touching his
head.The Indian led the way to the teepee that stood slightly apart from the
others.Inside the teepee upon some skins and blankets lay the boy, whose bright
eyes and flushed cheeks proclaimed fever.An old squaw, bent in form and
wrinkled in face, crouched at the end of the couch, her eyes gleaming
like beads of black glass in her mahogany face.grunted the lad, and remained perfectly motionless but for the
restless glittering eyes that followed every movement of his father."You want the doctor here," said Cameron in a serious tone, kneeling
beside the couch.And you can't get him
too quick.Better send a boy to the Fort and get the Police doctor."Go this way--this way," throwing his arms
about his head.He was hearing a jingle of spurs
and bridle from down the trail and he knew that the Inspector had
arrived.The old Indian, too, had caught the sound.His piercing eyes
swiftly searched the face of the white man beside him.But Cameron,
glancing quietly at him, continued to discuss the condition of the boy."Yes, you must get the doctor here at once.There is danger of
blood-poisoning.And he continued to
describe the gruesome possibilities of neglect of that lacerated wound.As he rose from the couch the boy caught his arm.The eager look in
the fevered eye touched Cameron."All right, boy, I shall tell her," he said.He took the
boy's hand in his.But the boy held it fast in a nervous grasp."You' squaw come--make good."Together they passed out of the teepee, Cameron keeping close to the
Indian's side and talking to him loudly and earnestly about the boy's
condition, all the while listening to the Inspector's voice from behind
the row of teepees.he exclaimed aloud as they came in sight of the Inspector mounted
on his horse."Here is my friend, Inspector Dickson.We have a sick boy and I want you to
help us."cried the Inspector, riding up and dismounting.Trotting Wolf and the other Indians slowly drew near."There is a sick boy in here," said Cameron, pointing to the teepee
behind him."He is the son of this man, Chief--" He paused.Without an instant's hesitation the Indian replied:

"Chief Onawata.""His boy got his foot in a trap.My wife dressed the wound last night,"
continued Cameron."He needs the doctor, however," said Cameron.said Cameron, throwing his friend a
significant glance.As his one hand closed on the Indian's his other slid down upon
his wrist."I want you, Chief," he said in a quiet stern voice."I want
you to come along with me."His hand had hardly closed upon the wrist than with a single motion,
swift, snake-like, the Indian wrenched his hand from the Inspector's
iron grasp and, leaping back a space of three paces, stood with body
poised as if to spring.The Indian turned to see Cameron covering him with two guns.At once
he relaxed his tense attitude and, drawing himself up, he demanded in a
voice of indignant scorn:

"Why you touch me?As he stood, erect, tall, scornful, commanding, with his head thrown
back and his arm outstretched, his eyes glittering and his face eloquent
of haughty pride, he seemed the very incarnation of the wild unconquered
spirit of that once proud race he represented.For a moment or two a
deep silence held the group of Indians, and even the white men were
impressed."Trotting Wolf," he said, "I want this man.I am going to take him to the Fort."No," said Trotting Wolf, in a loud voice, "he no bad man.A loud murmur rose from the Indians, who in larger numbers kept crowding
nearer.At this ominous sound the Inspector swiftly drew two revolvers,
and, backing toward the man he was seeking to arrest, said in a quiet,
clear voice:

"Trotting Wolf, this man goes with me.If he is no thief he will be
back again very soon.Six men die," shaking one of them,
"when this goes off.And six more die," shaking the other, "when
this goes off.The first man will be you, Trotting Wolf, and this man
second."Twelve men die if you
make any fuss.The
Piegans need a new Chief.If this man is no thief he will be back again
in a few days.Still Trotting Wolf stood irresolute.The Indians began to shuffle and
crowd nearer."Trotting Wolf," said the Inspector sharply, "tell your men that the
first man that steps beyond that poplar-tree dies.There was a hoarse guttural murmur in
response, but those nearest to the tree backed away from it.They knew
the Police never showed a gun except when prepared to use it.For
years they had been accustomed to the administration of justice and the
enforcement of law at the hands of the North West Mounted Police, and
among the traditions of that Force the Indians had learned to accept two
as absolutely settled: the first, that they never failed to get the man
they wanted; the second, that their administration of law was marked
by the most rigid justice.It was Chief Onawata himself that found the
solution.He uttered these words with an air
of quiet but impressive dignity."That's sensible," said the Inspector, moving toward him.His voice became low, soft, almost
tremulous.And we will see that
you get fair play."said the Indian, and, turning on his heel, he passed into the
teepee where his boy lay.Through the teepee wall their voices could be heard in quiet
conversation.In a few minutes the old squaw passed out on an errand and
then in again, eying the Inspector as she passed with malevolent hate.Again she passed out, this time bowed down under a load of blankets and
articles of Indian household furniture, and returned no more.Still the
conversation within the teepee continued, the boy's voice now and again
rising high, clear, the other replying in low, even, deep tones."I will just get my horse, Inspector," said Cameron, making his way
through the group of Indians to where Ginger was standing with sad and
drooping head."Time's up, I should say," said the Inspector to Cameron as he returned
with his horse."Just give him a call, will you?"Cameron stepped to the door of the teepee."Come along, Chief, we must be going," he said, putting his head inside
the teepee door.he cried, "Where the deuce--where is he gone?"On the couch the boy still lay, his
eyes brilliant with fever but more with hate.At the foot of the couch
still crouched the old crone, but there was no sign of the Chief.said the Inspector to the old squaw, turning the blankets and
skins upside down.she laughed in diabolical glee, spitting at him as he
passed."No one except the old squaw here.And the two men stood looking at each
other.said Cameron in deep disgust, "We're done.he cried, "Let us search this camp,
though it's not much use."Through every teepee they searched in hot
haste, tumbling out squalling squaws and papooses.Copperhead had as completely disappeared as if he had vanished into thin
air.With faces stolid and unmoved by a single gleam of satisfaction the
Indians watched their hurried search."We will take a turn around this camp," said Cameron, swinging on to his
pony.he continued, riding up close to Trotting Wolf, "We
haven't got our man but we will come back again.If I lose a single steer this fall I shall come and take you, Trotting
Wolf, to the Fort, if I have to bring you by the hair of the head."But Trotting Wolf only shrugged his shoulders, saying:

"No see cow.""Is there any use taking a look around this camp?"There is a faint
chance we might come across a trace."But no trace did they find, though they spent an hour and more in close
and minute scrutiny of the ground about the camp and the trails leading
out from it.You may as well come along with me, Inspector.We can talk
things over as we go."They were a silent and chagrined pair as they rode out from the Reserve
toward the ranch.As they were climbing from the valley to the plateau
above they came to a soft bit of ground.Here Cameron suddenly drew rein
with a warning cry, and, flinging himself off his broncho, was upon his
knee examining a fresh track."A pony-track, by all that's holy!It is our man,"
he cried, examining the trail carefully and following it up the hill and
out on to the plateau."It is our man sure enough, and he is taking this
trail."For some miles the pony-tracks were visible enough."Where do you think he is heading for, Inspector?""Well," said the Inspector, "this trail strikes toward the Blackfoot
Reserve by way of your ranch."As he spoke the ginger- broncho leaped into a gallop.Five miles
away a thin column of smoke could be seen rising up into the air.Every
mile made it clearer to Cameron that the smoke rising from behind the
round-topped hill before him was from his ranch-buildings, and every
mile intensified his anxiety.His wife was alone on the ranch at the
mercy of that fiend.That was the agonizing thought that tore at his
heart as his panting broncho pounded along the trail.From the top
of the hill overlooking the ranch a mile away his eye swept the scene
below, swiftly taking in the details.The ranch-house was in flames and
burning fiercely.A horse stood tied to
the corral and two figures were hurrying to and fro about the blazing
building.As they neared the scene it became clear that one of the
figures was that of a woman."Mandy, thank God it's you!"But they were too absorbed in their business of fighting the fire.They
neither heard nor saw him till he flung himself off his broncho at their
side."Oh, Allan, I am so sorry."Why, Mandy, I have YOU
safe.Again he laughed aloud, holding her off from
him at arm's length and gazing at her grimy face."Mandy," he said, "I
believe you are improving every day in your appearance, but you never
looked so stunning as this blessed minute.""Oh, yes, by the way," he said, "the house.And who's the Johnny
carrying water there?""Rather wobbly about the knees, isn't he?"I feared I should never see you again," he said in a voice that
trembled and broke."Smith, I think," said Mandy.I was afraid that--but
no matter.Cameron," cried the Inspector, taking both her hands in his,
"I'm awfully glad there's nothing wrong."But we were afraid--of that--eh--that is--"

"Yes, Mandy," said her husband, making visible efforts to control his
voice, "we frankly were afraid that that old devil Copperhead had come
this way and--"

"He did!"Oh, Allan, I was going to tell you just as the Inspector came,
and I am so sorry.I was afraid of what
all those Indians might do to you, so I thought I would ride up the
trail a bit.I got near to where it branches off toward the Reserve near
by those pine trees.There I saw a man come tearing along on a pony.He was just going past when he glanced at
me.He stopped and came rushing at me, waving a pistol in his hand.I wonder I ever thought him fine-looking.She pulled
up her sleeve, and upon the firm brown flesh blue and red finger marks
could be seen."He caught me and shook me and fairly yelled at me, 'You
save my boy once.Next time me see your man me kill
him.'He flung me away from him and nearly off my horse--such eyes!such
a face!--and went galloping off down the trail.I feared I was going to
be ill, so I came on homeward.When I reached the top of the hill I saw
the smoke and by the time I arrived the house was blazing and Smith was
carrying water to put out the fire where it had caught upon the smoke
house and stables."The men listened to her story with tense white faces.When she had
finished Cameron said quietly:

"Mandy, roll me up some grub in a blanket."To get my hands on that Indian's throat.""Yes, now," he said, moving toward his horse.The word arrested him as if a hand had gripped him."You," he said in a dazed manner."Why, Mandy, of course, there's you.Then, shaking his shoulders as if throwing
off a load, he said impatiently, "Oh, I am a fool.That devil has sent
me off my head.I tell you what, Mandy, we will feed first, then we will
make new plans.""And there is Moira, too," said Mandy.After all,"
he continued, with a slight laugh and with slow deliberation,
"there's--lots--of time--to--get him!"CHAPTER VII

THE SARCEE CAMP


The sun had reached the peaks of the Rockies far in the west, touching
their white with red, and all the lesser peaks and all the rounded
hills between with great splashes of gold and blue and purple.It is the
sunset and the sunrise that make the foothill country a world of mystery
and of beauty, a world to dream about and long for in later days.Through this mystic world of gold and blue and purple drove Cameron and
his wife, on their way to the little town of Calgary, three days after
the ruthless burning of their home.As the sun dipped behind the western
peaks they reached the crossing of the Elbow and entered the wide Bow
Valley, upon whose level plain was situated the busy, ambitious and
would-be wicked little pioneer town.The town and plain lay bathed in
a soft haze of rosy purple that lent a kind of Oriental splendor to
the tawdry, unsightly cluster of shacks that sprawled here and there in
irregular bunches on the prairie."How wonderful this great plain
with its encircling rivers, those hills with the great peaks beyond!"There is no finer," replied her husband, "anywhere in the world that I
know, unless it be that of 'Auld Reekie.'""What else but the finest of all the
capitals of Europe?""I
never get used to the wonder of Calgary.You see that deep cut between
those peaks in the far west?That is where 'The Gap' lies, through which
the Bow flows toward us.A great site this for a great town some day.But you ought to see these peaks in the morning with the sunlight coming
up from the east across the foothills and falling upon them.he cried to the broncho, which owed its name to
the speckled appearance of its hide, and which at the present moment
was plunging and kicking at a dog that had rushed out from an Indian
encampment close by the trail."Did you never see an Indian dog before?""Oh, Allan," cried Mandy with a shudder, "do you know I can't bear to
look at an Indian since last week, and I used to like them.""Hardly fair, though, to blame the whole race for the deviltry of one
specimen.""I know that, but--"

"This is a Sarcee camp, I fancy.They are a cunning lot and not the most
reliable of the Indians.Let me see--three--four teepees.Ought to be
fifteen or twenty in that camp.The braves apparently
are in town painting things up a bit."A quarter of a mile past the Indian encampment the trail made a sharp
turn into what appeared to be the beginning of the main street of the
town.He pointed
with his whip down the trail to what seemed to be a rolling cloud of
dust, vocal with wild whoops and animated with plunging figures of men
and ponies.cried Cameron to his plunging, jibing
bronchos, who were evidently unwilling to face that rolling cloud of
dust with its mass of shrieking men and galloping ponies thundering down
upon them.Swift and fierce upon their flanks fell the hissing lash."Stand up to them, you beggars!"he shouted to his bronchos, which
seemed intent upon turning tail and joining the approaching cavalcade.he yelled, standing up in his wagon,
waving his whip and holding his bronchos steadily on the trail.The
next moment the dust cloud enveloped them and the thundering cavalcade,
parting, surged by on either side."For two shillings I'd go back and
break some of their necks.he continued,
grinding his teeth in fury.He pulled up his bronchos with half a mind to turn them about and pursue
the flying Indians.His experience and training with the Mounted Police
made it difficult for him to accept with equal mind what he called the
infernal cheek of a bunch of Indians.At the entreaties of his wife,
however, he hesitated in carrying his purpose into effect."They didn't hurt us, after all."Well, I shall
see about this later."He gave his excited bronchos their head and
sailed into town, drawing up in magnificent style at the Royal Hotel.An attendant in cowboy garb came lounging up.And rosebuds ain't in it with you, Colonel."Billy was from the
land of colonels."You've got a whole garden with you this trip, eh?""My wife, Billy," replied Cameron, presenting her."Proud to meet you, madam."Yes, indeed, well and happy," cried Mandy emphatically."Sure thing, if looks mean anything," said Billy, admiration glowing in
his eyes.But I'll take care of 'em
all right."I shall be back presently, Billy," said Cameron, passing into the dingy
sitting-room that opened off the bar.In a few minutes he had his wife settled in a frowsy little eight-by-ten
bedroom, the best the hotel afforded, and departed to attend to his
team, make arrangements for supper and inquire about the incoming train.The train he found to be three hours late.His team he found in the
capable hands of Billy, who was unharnessing and rubbing them down.While ordering his supper a hand gripped his shoulder and a voice
shouted in his ear:

"Hello, old sport!"It's awfully good to see
you.Oh, yes, of course, I remember.You left the
construction camp and came here to settle down."All the while Cameron
was speaking he was shaking his friend's hand with both of his."By
Jove, but you're fit!"he continued, running his eye over the slight but
athletic figure of his friend.Never fitter, not even in the old days when I used to pass the
pigskin to you out of the scrimmage.A little extra work and a little worry, but I'll tell you
later.""Well, what are you on to now?"We've just come in from a hundred and fifty miles'
drive."Look here,
Connolly," he turned to the proprietor behind the bar, "a bang-up supper
for three.All the season's delicacies and all the courses in order.As
you love me, Connolly, do us your prettiest.A
hundred and fifty miles, remember.Now, then, how's my old nurse?"he
continued, turning back to Cameron."She was my nurse, remember, till
you came and stole her.""But she will be glad to see
you.Where's MY nurse, then, my little nurse, who saw me through a fever
and a broken leg?""Oh, she's up in the mountains still, in the construction camp.I
proposed to bring her down here with me, but there was a riot.If ever she gets out from that camp it will be when they are
all asleep or when she is in a box car.""I have much to tell you, and my wife
will be glad to see you.Why, I never thought your
sister--by No."Say, Doc," said the hotel man, breaking into the conversation."There's
a bunch of 'em comin' in, ain't there?Who's the lady you was expectin'
yourself on No.Wake up, Connolly, you're walking in your sleep," violently
signaling to the hotel man."Oh, it won't do, Martin," said Cameron with grave concern.Connolly is a well-known somnambulist.""Is it catchin,' for I guess you had the
same thing last night?""Connolly, you've gone batty!But I guess you've got to the point where
you need a preacher.laughed the hotel
man, winking at Cameron.He's batty, I tell
you."All right," said Cameron, "never mind.I shall run up and tell my wife
you are here.Wait for me," he cried, as he ran up the stairs."But, Doc, you did say--"

"Oh, confound you!It was--"

"But you did say--"

"Will you shut up?"But you said--"

"Look here!""He'll be down in a
minute."Connolly, close that trap of yours and listen to me.He'll be back in a jiffy.It's the same lady as he is going to meet."And now you've queered me
with him and he will think--"

"Aw, Doc, let me be."I don't leave
no pard of mine in a hole.Say," he cried, turning to Cameron, "about
that lady.He got a permit last week and he hasn't been
sober for a day since."said Cameron, looking at his friend suspiciously."I suppose I might as well tell you.I found out that your sister was to be in on this train, and in case you
should not turn up I told Connolly here to have a room ready.""Oh," said Cameron, with his eyes upon his friend's face.And how did you find out that Moira was coming?""Well," said Martin, his face growing hotter with every word of
explanation, "you have a wife and we have a mutual friend in our little
nurse, and that's how I learned.And so I thought I'd be on hand
anyway.You remember I met your sister up at your Highland home with the
unpronounceable name.""Moira
will be heart broken every day when she sees the Big Horn Ranch, I'm
afraid.The meeting between the doctor and Cameron's wife was like that between
old comrades in arms, as indeed they had been through many a hard fight
with disease, accident and death during the construction days along the
line of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Rocky Mountains.A jolly hour they had together at supper, exchanging news and retailing
the latest jokes.And then Cameron told his friend the story of old
Copperhead and of the task laid upon him by Superintendent Strong.Martin listened in grave silence till the tale was done, then said with
quiet gravity:

"Cameron, this is a serious business."Yes," replied Mandy quickly, "but you can see that he must do it.Surely--"

"No, there is no one else quite so fit to do it," said Mandy."By Jove, you're a wonder!"cried Martin, his face lighting up with
sudden enthusiasm."Not much of a wonder," she replied, a quick tremor in her voice."Not
much of a wonder, I'm afraid.I couldn't keep
him, could I," she said, "if his country needs him?"The doctor glanced at her face with its appealing deep blue eyes."Now, Mandy," said Cameron, "you must upstairs and to bed."He read
aright the signs upon her face."You are tired and you will need all the
sleep you can get.Wait for me, Martin, I'll be down in a few moments."When they reached their room Cameron turned and took his wife in his
arms.You
have nerve enough for both of us, and you will need to have nerve for
both, for how I am going to leave you I know not.Oh, I won't try to hide it from you, Mandy.Martin and I--going up to the Barracks.Superintendent Strong has come down for a consultation."He paused and
looked into his wife's face."Yes, yes, I know, Allan.But--do you know--it's foolish
to say it, but as those Indians passed us I fancied I saw the face of
Copperhead.""Hardly, I fancy," said her husband with a laugh."He'd know better than
run into this town in open day just now.All Indians will look to you
like old Copperhead for a while.""You may be sure of that, sweetheart.The little town of Calgary stands on one of the most beautiful
town-sites in all the world.A great plain with ramparts of hills on
every side, encircled by the twin mountain rivers, the Bow and the
Elbow, overlooked by rolling hills and far away to the west by the
mighty peaks of the Rockies, it holds at once ample space and unusual
picturesque beauty.The little town itself was just emerging from its
early days as a railway construction-camp and was beginning to develop
ambitions toward a well-ordered business activity and social stability.It was an all-night town, for the simple and sufficient reason that its
communications with the world lying to the east and to the west began
with the arrival of No.2 at half-past twelve at night and No.1 at
five o'clock next morning.Few of its citizens thought it worth while
to settle down for the night until after the departure of No.Through this "all-night" little town Cameron and the doctor took their
way.The sidewalks were still thronged, the stores still doing business,
the restaurants, hotels, pool-rooms all wide open.It kept
Sergeant Crisp busy enough running out the "tin-horn" gamblers and
whisky-peddlers, keeping guard over the fresh and innocent lambs
that strayed in from the East and across from the old land ready for
shearing, and preserving law and order in this hustling frontier town.Money was still easy in the town, and had Sergeant Crisp been minded
for the mere closing of his eyes or turning of his back upon occasion he
might have retired early from the Force with a competency.Unhappily for
Sergeant Crisp, however, there stood in the pathway of his fortune the
awkward fact of his conscience and his oath of service.Consequently
he was forced to grub along upon the munificent bounty of the daily pay
with which Her Majesty awarded the faithful service of the non-coms.And indeed through all the wide
reaches of that great West land during those pioneer days and among all
the officers of that gallant force no record can be found of an officer
who counted fortune dearer than honor.Through this wide awake, wicked, but well-watched little town Cameron
with his friend made his way westward toward the Barracks to keep his
appointment with his former Chief, Superintendent Strong.The Barracks
stood upon the prairie about half a mile distant from the town.They
found Superintendent Strong fuming with impatience, which he controlled
with difficulty while Cameron presented his friend."Well, Cameron, you've come at last," was his salutation when the
introduction was completed.I have been
waiting all day to see you."Arrived an hour ago," said Cameron shortly, for he did not half like
the Superintendent's brusque manner."The trail was heavy owing to the
rain day before yesterday.""The colts were green and I couldn't
send them along.""You needn't apologize
for the colts, Cameron.""I wasn't apologizing for anybody or anything.I was making a statement
of fact," replied Cameron curtly."Ah, yes, very good going, Cameron.Very good going, indeed, I should
say," said the Superintendent, conscious of his own brusqueness and
anxious to appease.That is a long drive for a lady to make, Cameron.Too long a
drive, I should say.I hope she is quite well, not--eh--over-fatigued?""Well, she is an old campaigner," said the Superintendent with a smile,
"and not easily knocked up if I remember her aright.But I ought to
say, Cameron, how very deeply I appreciate your very fine--indeed very
handsome conduct in volunteering to come to our assistance in this
matter.It will have a good effect upon
the community.The Commissioner and the
whole Force will appreciate it.But," he added, as if to himself,
"before we are through with this business I fear there will be more
sacrifice demanded from all of us.I trust none of us will be found
wanting."The Superintendent's voice was unduly solemn, his manner
almost somber.Cameron was impressed with this manifestation of feeling
so unusual with the Superintendent."Yes, every post brings news of seditious meetings up north along the
Saskatchewan and of indifference on the part of the Government.And
further, I have the most conclusive evidence that our Indians are being
tampered with, and successfully too.There is no reason to doubt that
the head chiefs have been approached and that many of the minor chiefs
are listening to the proposals of Riel and his half-breeds.But you
have some news to give, I understand?Dickson said you would give me
particulars."Thereupon Cameron briefly related the incidents in connection with the
attempted arrest of the Sioux Chief, and closed with a brief account of
the burning of his home."That is most daring, most serious," exclaimed the Superintendent."But
you are quite certain that it was the Sioux that was responsible for the
outrage?""Well," said Cameron, "he met my wife on a trail five miles away,
threatened her, and--"

"Good God, Cameron!"Yes, nearly flung her off her horse," replied Cameron, his voice quiet
and even, but his eyes glowing like fires in his white face."Only that he terrified her with his threats and then went on toward the
house, which he left in flames."I
apologize for my abrupt manner a moment ago," he added, offering his
hand."It's all right, Superintendent," replied Cameron."I'm afraid I am a
little upset myself.""But what a God's mercy she escaped!Then Cameron told the story of the rescue of the Indian boy."That undoubtedly explains it," exclaimed the Superintendent.Do an Indian a good turn and he will never
forget it.I shudder to think of what might have happened, for I assure
you that this Copperhead will stick at nothing.We have an unusually
able man to deal with, and we shall put our whole Force on this business
of arresting this man."No," said Cameron, "except that it would appear to be a mistake to give
any sign that we were very specially anxious to get him just now.So
far we have not shown our hand.Any concentrating of the Force upon his
capture would only arouse suspicion and defeat our aim, while my going
after him, no matter how keenly, will be accounted for on personal
grounds.""There is something in that, but do you think you can get him?""I am going to get him," said Cameron quietly."By Jove, I believe you will!But remember, you can count on me and on
my Force to a man any time and every time to back you up, and there's my
hand on it.And now, let's get at this thing.We have a cunning devil
to do with and he has gathered about him the very worst elements on the
reserves."Together they sat and made their plans till far on into the night.But
as a matter of fact they could make little progress.They knew well it
would be extremely difficult to discover their man.Owing to the state
of feeling throughout the reserves the source of information upon
which the Police ordinarily relied had suddenly dried up or become
untrustworthy.A marked change had come over the temper of the Indians.While as yet they were apparently on friendly terms and guilty of no
open breach of the law, a sullen and suspicious aloofness marked the
bearing of the younger braves and even of some of the chiefs toward the
Police.Then, too, among the Piegans in the south and among the
Sarcees whose reserve was in the neighborhood of Calgary an epidemic
of cattle-stealing had broken out and the Police were finding it
increasingly difficult to bring the criminals to justice.Hence with
this large increase in crime and with the changed attitude and temper of
the Indians toward the Police, such an amount of additional patrol-work
was necessary that the Police had almost reached the limit of their
endurance."In fact, we have really a difficult proposition before us, short-handed
as we are," said the Superintendent as they closed their interview."Indeed, if things become much worse we may find it necessary to
organize the settlers as Home Guards.An outbreak on the Saskatchewan
might produce at any moment the most serious results here and in British
Columbia.Meantime, while we stand ready to help all we can, it looks to
me, Cameron, that you are right and that in this business you must go it
alone pretty much.""I realize that, sir," replied Cameron."But first I must get my house
built and things in shape, then I hope to take this up."He can't do
much more harm in a month, and meantime we shall do our utmost to obtain
information and we shall keep you informed of anything we discover."The Superintendent and Sergeant accompanied Cameron and his friend to
the door."It is a black night," said Sergeant Crisp."I hope they're not running
any 'wet freight' in to-night.""It's a good night for it, Sergeant," said Dr."Do you expect
anything to come in?""I have heard rumors," replied the Sergeant, "and there is a freight
train standing right there now which I have already gone through but
upon which it is worth while still to keep an eye.""Well, good-night," said the Superintendent, shaking Cameron by
the hand."Keep me posted and when within reach be sure and see me."All right, sir, you have only to say the word."The night was so black that the trail which in the daylight was worn
smooth and plainly visible was quite blotted out.The light from the
Indian camp fire, which was blazing brightly a hundred yards away,
helped them to keep their general direction."For a proper black night commend me to the prairie," said the doctor."It is the dead level does it, I believe.There is nothing to cast a
reflection or a shadow.""It will be better in a few minutes," said Cameron, "when we get our
night sight.""You are off the trail a bit, I think," said the doctor.The light makes it better
going that way.""I say, that chap appears to be going some.Quite a song and dance he's
giving them," said the doctor, pointing to an Indian who in the full
light of the camp fire was standing erect and, with hand outstretched,
was declaiming to the others, who, kneeling or squatting about the fire,
were giving him rapt attention.The erect figure and outstretched arm
arrested Cameron.A haunting sense of familiarity floated across his
memory."Let's go nearer," he said, "and quietly."With extreme caution they made about two-thirds of the distance when a
howl from an Indian dog revealed their presence.At once the speaker
who had been standing in the firelight sank crouching to the ground.Instantly Cameron ran forward a few swift steps and, like a hound upon
a deer, leapt across the fire and fair upon the crouching Indian, crying
"Call the Police, Martin!"Martin sprang into the
middle of an excited group of Indians.Two of them threw themselves
upon him, but with a hard right and left he laid them low and, seizing
a stick of wood, sprang toward two others who were seeking to batter the
life out of Cameron as he lay gripping his enemy by the throat with one
hand and with the other by the wrist to check a knife thrust.Swinging
his stick around his head and repeating his cry for help, Martin made
Cameron's assailants give back a space and before they could renew the
attack Sergeant Crisp burst open the door of the Barracks, and, followed
by a Slim young constable and the Superintendent, came rushing with
shouts upon the scene.Immediately upon the approach of the Police the
Indians ceased the fight and all that could faded out of the light into
the black night around them, while the Indian who continued to struggle
with incredible fury to free himself from Cameron's grip suddenly became
limp and motionless."Why, it's you, doctor,
and where--?The incidents leading up to the present
situation were briefly described by the doctor."I can't get this fellow free," said the Sergeant, who was working hard
to release the Indian's throat from the gripping fingers.He turned
Cameron over on his back.Blood was pouring
from his mouth and nose, but his fingers like steel clamps were gripping
the wrist and throat of his foe."No," said Martin, with his hand upon Cameron's heart.You can't loosen his fingers till he revives.The blow that knocked him
senseless set those fingers as they are and they will stay set thus till
released by returning consciousness."shouted the Superintendent to the slim
young constable.Gradually as the water was splashed upon his face Cameron came back to
life and, relaxing his fingers, stretched himself with a sigh as of vast
relief and lay still.cried the Sergeant, dashing the rest of
the water into the face of the Indian lying rigid and motionless on the
ground.A long shudder ran through the Indian's limbs.Clutching at
his throat with both hands, he raised himself to a sitting posture, his
breath coming in raucous gasps, glared wildly upon the group, then sank
back upon the ground, rolled over upon his side and lay twitching and
breathing heavily, unheeded by the doctor and Police who were working
hard over Cameron."No bones broken, I think," said the doctor, feeling the battered head."Here's where the blow fell that knocked him out," pointing to a ridge
that ran along the side of Cameron's head."A little lower, a little
more to the front and he would never have moved.Cameron opened his eyes, struggled to speak and sank back again.Could you
get a little brandy, Sergeant?"Again the slim young constable rushed toward the Barracks and in a few
moments returned with the spirits.After taking a sip of the brandy
Cameron again opened his eyes and managed to say "Don't--"

"All right, old chap," said the doctor.But as once more Cameron opened his eyes the agony of the
appeal in them aroused the doctor's attention.The appealing eyes closed, then, opening again, turned toward the
Superintendent.Once more with painful effort Cameron managed to utter the word
"Copperhead."Daniel travelled to the garden.ejaculated the Superintendent in a low tense voice,
springing to his feet and turning toward the unconscious Indian.he
shouted, "Call out the whole Force!Surround this camp and hold every
Indian.Search every teepee for this fellow who was lying here.Leaving Cameron to the doctor, who in a few minutes became
satisfied that no serious injury had been sustained, he joined in the
search with fierce energy.The teepees were searched, the squaws and
papooses were ruthlessly bundled out from their slumbers and with the
Indians were huddled into the Barracks.But of the Sioux Chief there was
no sign.Within a quarter of an hour half
a dozen mounted constables were riding off in different directions to
cover the main trails leading to the Indian reserves and to sweep a wide
circle about the town."They will surely get him," said Dr."Not much chance of it," growled Cameron, to whom with returning
consciousness had come the bitter knowledge of the escape of the man
he had come to regard as his mortal enemy."I had him fast enough," he
groaned, "in spite of the best he could do, and I would have choked his
life out had it not been for these other devils.""They certainly jumped in savagely," said Martin."In fact I cannot
understand how they got at the thing so quickly.""Yes, I heard that call, and it mighty near did the trick for you.Thank
Heaven your thick Hielan' skull saved you."Because he was too swift for us," said the Superintendent, who had
come in, "and we too slow.I thought it was an ordinary Indian row,
you see, but I might have known that you would not have gone in in that
style without good reason.Who would think that this old devil should
have the impudence to camp right here under our nose?Where did he come
from anyway, do you suppose?""Been to the Blackfoot Reserve like enough and was on his way to the
Sarcees when he fell in with this little camp of theirs.""That's about it," replied the Superintendent gloomily."And to think
you had him fast and we let him go!"The thought brought small comfort to any of them, least of all to
Cameron.In that vast foothill country with all the hidings of the hills
and hollows there was little chance that the Police would round up the
fugitive, and upon Cameron still lay the task of capturing this cunning
and resourceful foe.But I'll get him some time or he'll get me,"
replied Cameron as his face settled into grim lines.Sore a bit in the head, but can navigate.""I can't tell you how disappointed and chagrined I feel.It isn't often
that my wits are so slow but--" The Superintendent's jaws here cut off
his speech with a snap.The one crime reckoned unpardonable in the men
under his own command was that of failure and his failure to capture old
Copperhead thus delivered into his hands galled him terribly."Well, good-night, Cameron," said the Superintendent, looking out into
the black night."We shall let you know to-morrow the result of our
scouting, though I don't expect much from it.He is much too clever to
be caught in the open in this country.""Perhaps he'll skidoo," said Dr."No, he's not that kind," replied the Superintendent.You have got to catch him or kill him.""I think you are right, sir," said Cameron."He will stay till his work
is done or till he is made to quit.""That is true, Cameron--till he is made to quit--and that's your job,"
said the Superintendent solemnly."Yes, that is my job, sir," replied Cameron simply and with equal
solemnity."We have every confidence in you, Cameron," replied the Superintendent."Good-night," he said again, shutting the door."Say, old man, this is too gruesome," said Martin with fierce
impatience."I can't see why it's up to you more than any other.""The Sun Dance Trail is the trail he must take to do his work.That was
my patrol last year--I know it best.God knows I don't want this--"
his breath came quick--"I am not afraid--but--but there's--We have been
together for such a little while, you know."He could get no farther for
a moment or two, then added quietly, "But somehow I know--yes and she
knows--bless her brave heart--it is my job.CHAPTER VIII

THE GIRL ON NO.By the time they had reached the hotel Cameron was glad enough to go to
his bed."You need not tell your wife, I suppose," said the doctor.Don't you fear, she is up to it."And so she was, and, though her face grew white as she listened to the
tale, never for a moment did her courage falter.Tell me," she said, her big blue eyes
holding his in a steady gaze."Right enough, but he must have a long sleep.You must not let him stir
at five.""Then," said Mandy, "I shall go to meet the train, Allan.""No, but I shall find her out."Martin in a deprecating tone, "I know Miss
Cameron, but--"

"Of course you do," cried Mandy.You will go
and Allan need not be disturbed.Not a word, now,
Allan.We will look after this, the doctor and I, eh, Doctor?""Why--eh--yes--yes certainly, of course.Under the influence of a powder left by Dr.Martin, Cameron, after an hour's tossing, fell into a heavy sleep."I am so glad you are here," said Mandy to the doctor, as he looked in
upon her."I am so thankful," said Mandy, heaving a deep sigh of relief, "and I am
so glad that you are here.And it is so nice that you know Moira.""No, no, there is no need, and I don't like to leave him."N-o-o, no, not at all--certainly not," said the doctor with growing
confidence."Oh," cried Mandy, "I shall meet you when you come.So glad you are here," she added with a tremulous smile."By Jove, she's a brick!""She has about all she
can stand just now.It's up to me now to do the Wild West welcome act, and
I'm scared--plain scared to death.I've got two hours yet to work up my ginger.I'll have a pipe to
start with."He passed into the bar, where, finding himself alone, he curled up in
a big leather chair and gave himself up to his pipe and his dreams.The
dingy bar-room gave place to a little sunny glen in the Highlands of
Scotland, in which nestled a little cluster of stone-built cottages,
moss-grown and rose-covered.Far down in the bottom of the Glen a tiny
loch gleamed like a jewel.Up on the hillside above the valley an avenue
of ragged pines led to a large manor house, old, quaint, but dignified,
and in the doorway a maiden stood, grave of face and wonderfully sweet,
in whose brown eyes and over whose brown curls all the glory of the
little Glen of the Cup of Gold seemed to gather.Through many pipes he
pursued his dreams, but always they led him to that old doorway and
the maiden with the grave sweet face and the hair and eyes full of the
golden sunlight of the Glen Cuagh Oir.he grumbled to himself at last, knocking the ashes from
his pipe.He lit a fresh pipe and began anew to dream of that wonderful day, that
day which was the one unfading point of light in all his Old Country
stay.Not even the day when he stood to receive his parchment and the
special commendation of the Senatus and of his own professor for his
excellent work lived with him like that day in the Glen.Every detail of
the picture he could recall and ever in the foreground the maiden.With
deliberate purpose he settled himself in his chair and set himself to
fill in those fine and delicate touches that were necessary to make
perfect the foreground of his picture, the pale olive face with its
bewildering frame of golden waves and curls, the clear brown eyes, now
soft and tender, now flashing with wrath, and the voice with its soft
Highland cadence."By Jove, I'm dotty!I'll make an ass of myself, sure
thing, when I see her to-day."He sprang from his chair and shook
himself together."Besides, she has forgotten all about me."The chill morning air struck him sharply in the face.He
turned quickly, snatched his overcoat from a nail in the hall and put it
on.At this point Billy, who combined in his own person the offices of
ostler, porter and clerk, appeared, his lantern shining with a dim
yellow glare in the gray light of the dawn.1 is about due, Doc," he said.I say, Billy," said the Doctor, "want to do something for
me?"He pushed a dollar at Billy over the counter."Name it, Doc, without further insult," replied Billy, shoving the
dollar back with a lordly scorn."All right, Billy, you're a white little soul.I want your
ladies' parlor aired."I have a lady coming--I
have--that is--Sergeant Cameron's sister is coming--"

"Say no more," said Billy with a wink.But what about
the open window, Doc?"Open it up and put on a fire.Those Old Country people are mad about
fresh air.""All right, Doc," replied Billy with another knowing wink."The best is
none too good for her, eh?""Look here, now, Billy--" the doctor's tone grew severe--"let's have no
nonsense.He is knocked out, unable
to meet her.If you
have any think juice in that block of yours turn it on."Billy twisted one ear as if turning a cock, and tapped his forehead with
his knuckles."Doc," he said solemnly, "she's workin' like a watch, full jewel, patent
lever."Sitting-room aired, good fire going,
windows open and a cup of coffee.""You know well enough, Billy, you haven't got any but that infernal
green stuff fit to tan the stomach of a brass monkey.""All right, Billy, I trust you.They are death on tea in the Old
Country.You keep her out a-viewin' the scenery for half an hour.""And Billy, a big pitcher of hot water.They can't live without hot
water in the morning, those Old Country people."At this point a long drawn whistle sounded through the still morning
air.Say, Doc--"

But his words fell upon empty space."Say, he's a sprinter," said Billy to himself."He ain't takin' no
chances on bein' late.Shouldn't be surprised if the Doc got there all
right."He darted upstairs and looked around the ladies' parlor.The air was
heavy with mingled odors of the bar and the kitchen.A spittoon occupied
a prominent place in the center of the room.The tables were dusty, the
furniture in confusion.The ladies' parlor was perfectly familiar to
Billy, but this morning he viewed it with new eyes.He's too swift in his movements," he muttered
to himself as he proceeded to fling things into their places.He raised
the windows, opened the stove door and looked in.The ashes of many
fires half filling the box met his eyes with silent reproach."Say, the
Doc ain't fair," he muttered again."Them ashes ought to have been out
of there long ago."This fact none knew better than himself, inasmuch as
there was no other from whom this duty might properly be expected.Yet
it brought some small relief to vent his disgust upon this offending
accumulation of many days' neglect.He
was due in ten minutes to meet the possible guests for the Royal at the
train.He seized a pail left in the hall by the none too tidy housemaid
and with his hands scooped into it the ashes from the stove, and,
leaving a cloud of dust to settle everywhere upon tables and chairs, ran
down with his pail and back again with kindling and firewood and had
a fire going in an extraordinarily short time.He then caught up an
ancient antimacassar, used it as a duster upon chairs and tables, flung
it back again in its place over the rickety sofa and rushed for the
station to find that the train had already pulled in, had come to a
standstill and was disgorging its passengers upon the platform.All the comforts and
conveniences!That's all right, leave 'em to me.He saw the doctor wandering distractedly up and down the platform.Say, Doc," he added in a lower voice, coming near to the
doctor, "what's that behind you?"The doctor turned sharply and saw a young lady whose long clinging black
dress made her seem taller than she was.She wore a little black hat
with a single feather on one side, which gave it a sort of tam o'
shanter effect.Martin," she said in a voice that indicated immense
relief.Well do I remember you--and that day in the Cuagh Oir--but
you have forgotten all about that day."A little flush appeared on her
pale cheek."But you didn't know me," she added with a slight severity in her tone.She paused in a
sudden confusion, and with a little haughty lift of her head said,
"Where is Allan, my brother?"He was gazing at her in stupid
amazement."I was looking for a little girl," he said, "in a blue serge dress and
tangled hair, brown, and all curls, with brown eyes and--"

"And you found a grown up woman with all the silly curls in their proper
place--much older--very much older.It is a habit we have in Scotland of
growing older.""Yes, older, and more sober and sensible--and plainer."The doctor's mind was evidently not working with its usual
ease and swiftness, partly from amazement at the transformation that had
resulted in this tall slender young lady standing before him with
her stately air, and partly from rage at himself and his unutterable
stupidity."But you have not answered me," said the girl, obviously taken aback at
the doctor's manner.This is
Cal--gar--ry, is it not?""It's Calgary all right," cried the doctor, glad to find in this fact a
solid resting place for his mind.The alarm in her voice brought
him to himself.With an imperious air the young
lady lifted her head and impaled the doctor with her flashing brown
eyes."Well," said the doctor in halting confusion, "you see, he met with an
accident.""You are hiding something from me, Mr.My brother is ill, or--"

"No, no, not he.An Indian hit him on the head," said the doctor,
rendered desperate by her face.Her cry, her white face, the quick clutch of her hands at
her heart, roused the doctor's professional instincts and banished his
confusion."He is perfectly all right, I assure you, Miss Cameron.Only it was
better that he should have his sleep out.He was most anxious to meet
you, but as his medical adviser I urged him to remain quiet and offered
to come in his place.A day's rest, believe me,
will make him quite fit."The doctor's manner was briskly professional
and helped to quiet the girl's alarm."Most certainly, in a few hours when he wakes and when you are rested.Here, Billy, take Miss Cameron's checks."Say, Doc," said Billy in an undertone, "about that tea and toast--"

"What the deuce--?""Keep her a-viewin' the scenery, Doc, a bit," continued Billy under his
breath."Oh, get a move on, Billy!He was anxious to escape from a position that had
become intolerable to him.For months he had been looking forward to
this meeting and now he had bungled it.In the first place he had begun
by not knowing the girl who for three years and more had been in his
dreams day and night, then he had carried himself like a schoolboy
in her presence, and lastly had frightened her almost to death by his
clumsy announcement of her brother's accident.The young lady at his
side, with the quick intuition of her Celtic nature, felt his mood, and,
not knowing the cause, became politely distant.Martin pointed out the wonderful pearly
gray light stealing across the plain and beginning to brighten on the
tops of the rampart hills that surrounded the town."You will see the Rockies in an hour, Miss Cameron, in the far west
there," he said.But her tone, too, was
lifeless.Desperately the doctor strove to make conversation during their short
walk and with infinite relief did he welcome the appearance of Mandy at
her bedroom door waiting their approach."Your brother's wife, Miss Cameron," said he.For a single moment they stood searching each other's souls.Then by
some secret intuition known only to the female mind they reached a
conclusion, an entirely satisfactory conclusion, too, for at once they
were in each other's arms."Yes," said the girl in an eager, tremulous voice."No, no," cried Moira, "don't wake him.inquired Mandy, looking indignantly at
the doctor, who stood back, a picture of self condemnation.I bungled the whole
thing this morning and frightened Miss Cameron nearly into a fit, for
no other reason than that I am all ass.he added abruptly, lifted his hat and was
gone.said Mandy, looking at her sister-in-law."I do not know, I am sure," replied Moira indifferently.But come, my dear, take off your things.As the doctor says, a sleep for a couple of hours will do you good.You are looking very weary, dear, and no
wonder, no wonder," said Mandy, "with all that journey and--and all you
have gone through.""My, I
could just pick you up like a babe!"The caressing touch was too much for the girl."Och, oh," she cried, lapsing into her Highland speech, "it iss
ashamed of myself I am, but no one has done that to me for many a day
since--since--my father--"

"There, there, you poor darling," said Mandy, comforting her as if she
were a child, "you will not want for love here in this country.Cry
away, it will do you good."There was a sound of feet on the stairs."Hush, hush, Billy is coming."She swept the girl into her bedroom as
Billy appeared."Oh, I am just silly," said Moira impatiently, as she wiped her eyes."But you are so good, and I will never be forgetting your kindness to me
this day.""Hot water," said Billy, tapping at the door.Do you want hot water,
Moira?""Yes, the very thing I do want to get the dust out of my eyes and the
grime off my face.""And the tea is in the ladies' parlor," added Billy.cried Mandy, "the very thing!"Said they were all stuck on tea in the Old Country."I shall lie down, I think, for a little.""All right, dear, we will see you at breakfast.Again she kissed the girl and left her to sleep.She found Billy
standing in the ladies' parlor with a perplexed and disappointed look on
his face."The Doc said she'd sure want some tea," he said.The Doc--"

"Well, Billy, I'd just love a cup of tea if you don't mind wasting it on
me."The Doc won't mind, bein' as she turned it down."He needs a cup of tea; he's been up
all night."Judgin' by his langwidge I should surmise yes," said Billy judicially."Would you get him, Billy, and bring him here?"But as to bringin' him here, I'd prefer wild
cats myself.The last I seen of him he was hikin' for the Rockies with a
blue haze round his hair.""But what in the world is wrong with him, Billy?""The Doc's a pretty level headed cuss.There's
somethin' workin' on him, if you ask me.""Billy, you get him and tell him we want to see him at breakfast, will
you?""Tell him, Billy, I want him to see my husband then."And it did catch him, for, after breakfast was over, clean-shaven, calm
and controlled, and in his very best professional style, Dr.Martin made
his morning call on his patient.Rigidly he eliminated from his manner
anything beyond a severe professional interest.Mandy, who for two years
had served with him as nurse, and who thought she knew his every mood,
was much perplexed.Do what she could, she was unable to break through
the barrier of his professional reserve.He was kindly courteous and
perfectly correct."I would suggest a quiet day for him, Mrs.Cameron," was his verdict
after examining the patient."He will be quite able to get up in the
afternoon and go about, but not to set off on a hundred and fifty mile
drive.A quiet day, sleep, cheerful company, such as you can furnish
here, will fix him up.""Doctor, we will secure the quiet day if you will furnish the cheerful
company," said Mandy, beaming on him."I have a very busy day before me, and as for cheerful company, with you
two ladies he will have all the company that is good for him.""CHEERFUL company, you said, Doctor.If you desert us how can we be
cheerful?""Exactly for that reason," replied the doctor."Say, Martin," interposed Cameron, "take them out for a drive this
afternoon and leave me in peace."cried Mandy, "with one hundred and fifty miles behind me and
another hundred and fifty miles before me!""Moira, you used to be fond of riding.""And am still," cried the girl, with sparkling eyes."My habit is in one of my boxes," replied Moira."I can get a habit," said the doctor, "and two of them.""That's settled, then," cried Mandy.We shall do
some shopping, Allan, you and I this afternoon and you two can go off
to the hills.th--ink of that, Moira, for a highlander!"She
glanced at Moira's face and read refusal there.A whole week in an awful stuffy train."Yes, the very thing, Moira," cried her brother."We will have a long
talk this morning then in the afternoon we will do some business here,
Mandy and I, and you can go up the Bow."Nothing like it even in Scotland, and
that's saying a good deal," said her brother with emphasis.This arrangement appeared to give complete satisfaction to all parties
except those most immediately interested, but there seemed to be no very
sufficient reason with either to decline, hence they agreed.CHAPTER IX

THE RIDE UP THE BOW


Having once agreed to the proposal of a ride up the Bow, the doctor
lost no time in making the necessary preparations.Half an hour later he
found himself in the stable consulting with Billy.His mood was gloomy
and his language reflected his mood.Gladly would he have escaped what
to him, he felt, would be a trying and prolonged ordeal.But he could
not do this without exciting the surprise of his friends and possibly
wounding the sensitive girl whom he would gladly give his life to serve.He resolved that at all costs he would go through with the thing."I'll give her a good time, by Jingo!if I bust something," he muttered
as he walked up and down the stable picking out his mounts."But for a
compound, double-opposed, self-adjusting jackass, I'm your choice.Threw it clean away and queered myself with her first
shot.I say, Billy," he called, "come here.""Kick me, Billy," said the doctor solemnly."Well now, Doc, I--"

"Kick me, Billy, good and swift.""Don't believe I could give no satisfaction, Doc.But there's that Hiram
mule, he's a high class artist."No use being kicked, Billy, by something that wouldn't appreciate it,"
said Martin.He's an ornery cuss, he'd appreciate it all
right, that old mule.But Doc, what's eatin' you?""Oh, nothing, Billy, except that I'm an ass, an infernal ass."Then I guess I couldn't give you no satisfaction."Well, Billy, the horses at two," said the doctor briskly, "the broncho
and that dandy little pinto."Brace up, Doc, it's
comin' to you."Billy's wink conveyed infinitely more than his words."Look here, Billy, you cut that all out," said the doctor."All right, Doc, if that's the way you feel.You'll see no monkey-work
on me.I'll make a preacher look like a sideshow."And truly Billy's manner was irreproachable as he stood with the ponies
at the hotel door and helped their riders to mount.There was an almost
sad gravity in his demeanor that suggested a mind preoccupied with
solemn and unworldly thoughts with which the doctor and his affairs had
not even the remotest association.As Cameron who, with his wife, watched their departure from the balcony
above, waved them farewell, he cried, "Keep your eyes skinned for an
Indian, Martin."I've got no gun on me," replied the doctor, "and if I get sight of him,
you hear me, I'll make for the timber quick."What is all this about the Indian, Dr.inquired the girl at
his side as they cantered down the street."Well, I've done enough to you with that Indian already to-day.""Didn't I like a fool frighten you nearly to death with him?"But an Indian to an Old
Country person familiar with Fenimore Cooper, well--"

"Oh, I was a proper idiot all round this morning," grumbled the doctor."I didn't know what I was doing.""You see," continued the doctor desperately, "I'd looked forward to
meeting you for so long.""And then to think
that I actually didn't know you.""You didn't look at me," cried Moira."No, I was looking for the girl I saw that day, almost three years ago,
in the Glen."No, nor I," replied the girl softly.It was
a terrible day to us all in the Glen, my brother going to leave us and
under that dreadful cloud, and you came with the letter that cleared it
all away.Oh, it was like the coming of an angel from heaven, and I have
often thought, Mr.Martin you are now, of course--that I
never thanked you as I ought that day."Get at it," cried the doctor with great emphasis, "I need it.The truth is, I was
completely knocked out, flabbergasted.""I thought--" A faint
color tinged her pale cheek and she paused a moment.He
thinks me just a little girl not to be trusted with things.""He doesn't know you, then," said the doctor."I know you better than that, at least.""I know you are to be trusted with that or with anything else that calls
for nerve.Besides, sooner or later you must know about this Indian.Wait till we cross the bridge and reach the top of the hill yonder, it
will be better going."The hillside gave them a stiff scramble, for the trail went straight up.But the sure-footed ponies, scrambling over stones and gravel, reached
the top safely, with no worse result than an obvious disarrangement of
the girl's hair, so that around the Scotch bonnet which she had pinned
on her head the little brown curls were peeping in a way that quite
shook the heart of Dr."Now you look a little more like yourself," he cried, his eyes fastened
upon the curls with unmistakable admiration, "more like the girl I
remember.""Oh," she said, "it is my bonnet.I put on this old thing for the ride.""No," said the doctor, "you wore no bonnet that day.It is your face,
your hair, you are not quite--so--so proper.""Oh, my silly curls, I
suppose.("My joy," the doctor nearly had said.)"It is not a pleasant thing to greet a guest with," he said, "but you
must know it and I may as well give it to you.And, mind you, this is
altogether a new thing with us."For the next half hour as they rode westward toward the big hills,
steadily climbing as they went, the story of the disturbance in the
north country, of the unrest among the Indians, of the part played in
it by the Indian Copperhead, and of the appeal by the Superintendent to
Cameron for assistance, furnished the topic for conversation.The girl
listened with serious face, but there was no fear in the brown eyes, nor
tremor in the quiet voice, as they talked it over."Now let us forget it for a while," cried the doctor."The Police have
rarely, if ever, failed to get their man.And they
will get this chap, too.And as for the row on the Saskatchewan, I don't
take much stock in that.Now we're coming to a view in a few minutes,
one of the finest I have seen anywhere."For half a mile farther they loped along the trail that led them to the
top of a hill that stood a little higher than the others round about."What do you think of that for a view?"Before them stretched the wide valley of the Bow for many miles,
sweeping up toward the mountains, with rounded hills on either side, and
far beyond the hills the majestic masses of the Rockies some fifty miles
away, snow-capped, some of them, and here and there upon their faces
the great glaciers that looked like patches of snow.Through this wide
valley wound the swift flowing Bow, and up from it on either side the
hills, rough with rocks and ragged masses of pine, climbed till they
seemed to reach the very bases of the mountains beyond.Over all the
blue arch of sky spanned the wide valley and seemed to rest upon the
great ranges on either side, like the dome of a vast cathedral.Silent, with lips parted and eyes alight with wonder, Moira sat and
gazed upon the glory of that splendid scene."What do you think--" began the doctor.She put out her hand and touched his arm."Please don't speak," she breathed, "this is not for words, but for
worship."Long she continued to gaze in rapt silence upon the picture spread out
before her.It was, indeed, a place for worship.She pointed to a hill
some distance in front of them."Yes, I have been all through this country.From the top
of that hill we get a magnificent sweep toward the south."Down the hillside they scrambled, across a little valley and up the
farther side, following the trail that wound along the hill but declined
to make the top.As they rounded the shoulder of the little mountain
Moira cried:

"It would be a great view from the top there beyond the trees.For answer she flung herself from her pinto and, gathering up her habit,
began eagerly to climb.By the time the doctor had tethered the ponies
she was half way to the top.Putting forth all his energy he raced after
her, and together they parted a screen of brushwood and stepped out on
a clear rock that overhung the deep canyon that broadened into a great
valley sweeping toward the south.cried the doctor, as they stepped out together.She laid her hand upon his arm and drew him back into the bushes.Surprised into silence, he stood gazing at her.Her face was white and her eyes gleaming."An Indian down there," she
whispered.She led him by a little detour and on their hands and knees they crept
through the brushwood.They reached the open rock and peered down
through a screen of bushes into the canyon below.Across the little stream that flowed at the bottom of the canyon, and
not more than a hundred yards away, stood an Indian, tall, straight and
rigidly attent, obviously listening and gazing steadily at the point
where they had first stood.For many minutes he stood thus rigid while
they watched him.He sat down upon the rocky
ledge that sloped up from the stream toward a great overhanging crag
behind him, laid his rifle beside him and, calmly filling his pipe,
began to smoke."I do believe it is our Indian," whispered the doctor."Oh, if we could only get him!"Her face was pale but firm set with
resolve.Quickly he revolved in his mind the possibilities."If I only had a gun," he said to himself, "I'd risk it."The Indian was breaking off some dead twigs from the standing pines
about him."He's going to light a fire," replied the doctor, "perhaps camp for the
night.""Then," cried the girl in an excited whisper, "we could get him."The Indian soon had his fire going and,
unrolling his blanket pack, he took thence what looked like a lump of
meat, cut some strips from it and hung them from pointed sticks over the
fire.He proceeded to gather some poles from the dead wood lying about.The Indian proceeded to place the poles in order against the rock,
keeping his eye on the toasting meat the while and now and again turning
it before the fire.Then he began to cut branches of spruce and balsam.cried the doctor, greatly excited, "I declare
he's going to camp.""Then," cried the girl, "we can get him."He'd double me up like
a jack-knife."No, no," she cried quickly, "you stay here to watch him."I say," cried the doctor, "you are a wonder.He thought rapidly, then said, "No, it won't do.I can't allow
you to risk it."A year ago the doctor would not have hesitated a moment to allow her
to go, but now he thought of the roving bands of Indians and the
possibility of the girl falling into their hands."No, Miss Cameron, it will not do.""But think," she cried, "we might get him and save Allan all the trouble
and perhaps his life."Wait," he said, "let me think."I am used to riding alone among
the hills at home.""Ah, yes, at home," said the doctor gloomily."But there is no danger," she persisted.She stood up among the bushes looking down at him with
a face so fiercely resolved that he was constrained to say, "By Jove!"You would not do that," she cried, stamping her foot, "if I forbade
you.It is your duty to stay here and watch that Indian.It is mine to
go and get the Police."No," she said, "I forbid you to come.She glided through the bushes from his sight and was gone."She is taking a
chance, but after all it is worth while."It was now the middle of the afternoon and it would take Moira an hour
and a half over that rocky winding trail to make the ten miles that
lay before her.Ten minutes more would see the Police started on their
return.The doctor settled himself down to his three hours' wait,
keeping his eye fixed upon the Indian.The latter was now busy with his
meal, which he ate ravenously."The beggar has me tied up tight," muttered the doctor ruefully."My
grub is on my saddle, and I guess I dare not smoke till he lights up
himself."Thought it was the whole Blackfoot tribe.""You will be the better for something to eat," she said simply, handing
him the lunch basket."Say, she's a regular--" He paused and thought for a moment."She's an
angel, that's what--and a mighty sight better than most of them.She's
a--" He turned back to his watch, leaving his thought unspoken.In the
presence of the greater passions words are woefully inadequate.The Indian was still eating as ravenously as ever.He ought to be full soon at that rate.Wish
he'd get his pipe agoing."In due time the Indian finished eating, rolled up the fragments
carefully in a rag, and then proceeded to construct with the poles and
brush which he had cut, a penthouse against the rock.At one end his
little shelter thus constructed ran into a spruce tree whose thick
branches reached right to the ground.When he had completed this shelter
to his satisfaction he sat down again on the rock beside his smoldering
fire and pulled out his pipe."Go on, old boy, hit
her up."A pipe and then another the Indian smoked, then, taking his gun, blanket
and pack, he crawled into his brush wigwam out of sight."You are
safe for an hour or two, thank goodness.You had no sleep last night and
you've got to make up for it now.The doctor hugged himself with supreme satisfaction and continued
to smoke with his eye fixed upon the hole into which the Indian had
disappeared.Through the long hours he sat and smoked while he formulated the plan
of attack which he proposed to develop when his reinforcements should
arrive."We will work up behind him from away down the valley, a couple of us
will cover him from the front and the others go right in."He continued with great care to make and revise his plans, and while
in the midst of his final revision a movement in the bushes behind
him startled him to his feet.The bushes parted and the face of Moira
appeared with that of her brother over her shoulder.Never moved," said the doctor exultantly, and
proceeded to explain his plan of attack.He
stepped back through the bushes and brought forward Crisp and the
constable."Now, then, here's our plan," he said."You, Crisp, will go
down the canyon, cross the stream and work up on the other side right to
that rock.When you arrive at the rock the constable and I will go in."Fine, except that I propose to go in myself
with you."There's really no use, you know, Doctor.The constable and I can handle
him."Moira stood looking eagerly from one to the other."All right," said the doctor, "'nuff said.If you
want to come along, suit yourself.""Oh, do be careful," said Moira, clasping her hands.Not much fear
in you, I guess.""Moira, you stay here and keep your eye
on him.She pressed her lips tight together till they made a thin red line in
her white face."Oh, she can shoot--rabbits, at least," said her brother with a smile."I shall bring you one, Moira, but remember, handle it carefully."With a gun across her knees Moira sat and watched the development of the
attack.For many minutes there was no sign or sound, till she began to
wonder if a change had been made in the plan.At length some distance
down the canyon and on the other side Sergeant Crisp was seen working
his way with painful care step by step toward the rock of rendezvous.There was no sign of her brother or Dr.It was for them she
watched with an intensity of anxiety which she could not explain to
herself.At length Sergeant Crisp reached the crag against whose base
the penthouse leaned in which the sleeping Indian lay.Immediately she
saw her brother, quickly followed by Dr.Martin, leap the little stream,
run lightly up the sloping rock and join Crisp at the crag.Still there
was no sign from the Indian.She saw her brother motion the Sergeant
round to the farther corner of the penthouse where it ran into the
spruce tree, while he himself, with a revolver in each hand, dropped on
one knee and peered under the leaning poles.With a loud exclamation he
sprang to his feet.Like a hound on a scent
he ran to the back of the spruce tree and on his knees examined the
earth there.He struck the
trail and followed it round the rock and through the woods till he
came to the hard beaten track.Then he came back, pale with rage and
disappointment."I swear he never came out of that hole!""I kept my
eye on it every minute of the last three hours.""There's another hole," said Crisp, "under the tree here."Together they
retraced their steps across the little stream.On the farther bank they
found Moira, who had raced down to meet them."Gone for this time--but--some day--some
day," he added below his breath.But many things were to happen before that day came.CHAPTER X

RAVEN TO THE RESCUE


Overhead the stars were still twinkling far in the western sky.The crescent moon still shone serene, marshaling her attendant
constellations.Eastward the prairie still lay in deep shadow, its long
rolls outlined by the deeper shadows lying in the hollows between.Over
the Bow and the Elbow mists hung like white veils swathing the faces
of the rampart hills north and south.In the little town a stillness
reigned as of death, for at length Calgary was asleep, and sound asleep
would remain for hours to come.Through the dead stillness of the waning night
the liquid note of the adventurous meadow lark fell like the dropping
of a silver stream into the pool below.Brave little heart, roused from
slumber perchance by domestic care, perchance by the first burdening
presage of the long fall flight waiting her sturdy careless brood,
perchance stirred by the first thrill of the Event approaching from
the east.For already in the east the long round tops of the prairie
undulations are shining gray above the dark hollows and faint bars of
light are shooting to the zenith, fearless forerunners of the dawn,
menacing the retreating stars still bravely shining their pale defiance
to the oncoming of their ancient foe.Far toward the west dark masses
still lie invincible upon the horizon, but high above in the clear
heavens white shapes, indefinite and unattached, show where stand the
snow-capped mountain peaks.Thus the swift and silent moments mark the
fortunes of this age-long conflict.But sudden all heaven and all earth
thrill tremulous in eager expectancy of the daily miracle when, all
unaware, the gray light in the eastern horizon over the roll of the
prairie has grown to silver, and through the silver a streamer of palest
rose has flashed up into the sky, the gay and gallant 'avant courier' of
an advancing host, then another and another, then by tens and hundreds,
till, radiating from a center yet unseen, ten thousand times ten
thousand flaming flaunting banners flash into orderly array and possess
the utmost limits of the heavens, sweeping before them the ever paling
stars, that indomitable rearguard of the flying night, proclaiming
to all heaven and all earth the King is come, the Monarch of the Day.Flushed in the new radiance of the morning, the long flowing waves of
the prairie, the tumbling hills, the mighty rocky peaks stand surprised,
as if caught all unprepared by the swift advance, trembling and blushing
in the presence of the triumphant King, waiting the royal proclamation
that it is time to wake and work, for the day is come.All oblivious of this wondrous miracle stands Billy, his powers of mind
and body concentrated upon a single task, that namely of holding down
to earth the game little bronchos, Mustard and Pepper, till the party
should appear.Nearby another broncho, saddled and with the knotted
reins hanging down from his bridle, stood viewing with all too obvious
contempt the youthful frolics of the colts.Well he knew that life would
cure them of all this foolish waste of spirit and of energy.Meantime
on his part he was content to wait till his master--Dr.Martin, to
wit--should give the order to move.His master meantime was busily
engaged with clever sinewy fingers packing in the last parcels that
represented the shopping activities of Cameron and his wife during the
past two days.There was a whole living and sleeping outfit for the
family to gather together.Already a heavily laden wagon had gone on
before them.The building material for the new house was to follow,
for it was near the end of September and a tent dwelling, while quite
endurable, does not lend itself to comfort through a late fall in the
foothill country.Besides, there was upon Cameron, and still more upon
his wife, the ever deepening sense of a duty to be done that could not
wait, and for the doing of that duty due preparation must be made.Hence
the new house must be built and its simple appointments and furnishings
set in order without delay, and hence the laden wagon gone before and
the numerous packages in the democrat, covered with a new tent and roped
securely into place.This packing and roping the doctor made his peculiar care, for he was
a true Canadian, born and bred in the atmosphere of pioneer days in
old Ontario, and the packing and roping could be trusted to no amateur
hands, for there were hills to go up and hills to go down, sleughs to
cross and rivers to ford with all their perilous contingencies before
they should arrive at the place where they would be.said Cameron, coming out from the hotel with hand
bags and valises."They'll stay, I think," replied the doctor, "unless those bronchos of
yours get away from you."cried Moira, coming out at the moment and
dancing over to the bronchos' heads."Well, miss," said Billy with judicial care, "I don't know about that.They're ornery little cusses and mean-actin.'They'll go straight enough
if everything is all right, but let anythin' go wrong, a trace or a
line, and they'll put it to you good and hard.""I do not think I would be afraid of them," replied the girl, reaching
out her hand to stroke Pepper's nose, a movement which surprised that
broncho so completely that he flew back violently upon the whiffle-tree,
carrying Billy with him.said Billy, giving him a fierce yank."Oh, he ain't no lady's maid, miss.You would, eh, you young
devil,"--this to Pepper, whose intention to walk over Billy was only
too obvious--"Get back there, will you!Now then, take that, and stand
still!"Billy evidently did not rely solely upon the law of love in
handling his broncho.Moira abandoned him and climbed to her place in the democrat between
Cameron and his wife.Martin had learned that
a patient of his at Big River was in urgent need of a call, so, to the
open delight of the others and to the subdued delight of the doctor, he
was to ride with them thus far on their journey."Good-by, Billy," cried both ladies, to which Billy replied with a wave
of his Stetson.Away plunged the bronchos on a dead gallop, as if determined to end the
journey during the next half hour at most, and away with them went the
doctor upon his steady broncho, the latter much annoyed at being thus
ignominiously outdistanced by these silly colts and so induced to strike
a somewhat more rapid pace than he considered wise at the beginning of
an all-day journey.Away down the street between the silent shacks and
stores and out among the straggling residences that lined the trail.Away past the Indian encampment and the Police Barracks.Away across the
echoing bridge, whose planks resounded like the rattle of rifles
under the flying hoofs.Away up the long stony hill, scrambling and
scrabbling, but never ceasing till they reached the level prairie at the
top.Away upon the smooth resilient trail winding like a black ribbon
over the green bed of the prairie.Away down long, long <DW72>s to low,
wide valleys, and up long, long <DW72>s to the next higher prairie level.Away across the plain skirting sleughs where ducks of various kinds, and
in hundreds, quacked and plunged and fought joyously and all unheeding.Away with the morning air, rare and wondrously exhilarating, rushing
at them and past them and filling their hearts with the keen zest of
living.Away beyond sight and sound of the great world, past little
shacks, the brave vanguard of civilization, whose solitary loneliness
only served to emphasize their remoteness from the civilization which
they heralded.Away from the haunts of men and through the haunts
of wild things where the shy coyote, his head thrown back over his
shoulder, loped laughing at them and their futile noisy speed.Away
through the wide rich pasture lands where feeding herds of cattle
and bands of horses made up the wealth of the solitary rancher, whose
low-built wandering ranch house proclaimed at once his faith and his
courage.Away and ever away, the shining morning hours and the fleeting
miles racing with them, till by noon-day, all wet but still unweary, the
bronchos drew up at the Big River Stopping Place, forty miles from the
point of their departure.Martin, the steady pace of his wise
old broncho making up upon the dashing but somewhat erratic gait of the
colts.While the ladies passed into the primitive Stopping Place, the men
unhitched the ponies, stripped off their harness and proceeded to rub
them down from head to heel, wash out their mouths and remove from them
as far as they could by these attentions the travel marks of the last
six hours.Big River could hardly be called even by the generous estimate of the
optimistic westerner a town.It consisted of a blacksmith's shop, with
which was combined the Post Office, a little school, which did for
church--the farthest outpost of civilization--and a manse, simple, neat
and tiny, but with a wondrous air of comfort about it, and very like the
little Nova Scotian woman inside, who made it a very vestibule of heaven
for many a cowboy and rancher in the district, and last, the Stopping
Place run by a man who had won the distinction of being well known to
the Mounted Police and who bore the suggestive name of Hell Gleeson,
which appeared, however, in the old English Registry as Hellmuth Raymond
Gleeson.The Mounted Police thought it worth while often to run in upon
Hell at unexpected times, and more than once they had found it necessary
to invite him to contribute to Her Majesty's revenue as compensation for
Hell's objectionable habit of having in possession and of retailing to
his friends bad whisky without attending to the little formality of a
permit.The Stopping Place was a rambling shack, or rather a series of shacks,
loosely joined together, whose ramifications were found by Hell and his
friends to be useful in an emergency.The largest room in the building
was the bar, as it was called.Behind the counter, however, instead of
the array of bottles and glasses usually found in rooms bearing this
name, the shelf was filled with patent medicines, chiefly various
brands of pain-killer.Off the bar was the dining-room, and behind the
dining-room another and smaller room, while the room most retired in the
collection of shacks constituting the Stopping Place was known in
the neighborhood as the "snake room," a room devoted to those unhappy
wretches who, under the influence of prolonged indulgence in Hell's bad
whisky, were reduced to such a mental and nervous condition that the
landscape of their dreams became alive with snakes of various sizes,
shapes and hues.To Mandy familiarity had hardened her sensibilities to endurance of all
the grimy uncleanness of the place, but to Moira the appearance of
the house and especially of the dining-room filled her with loathing
unspeakable."Oh, Mandy," she groaned, "can we not eat outside somewhere?"No," she cried, "but we will do better."Oh, that would not do," said Moira, her Scotch shy independence
shrinking from such an intrusion."She doesn't know me--and there are four of us.""Oh, nonsense, you don't know this country.You don't know what our
visit will mean to the little woman, what a joy it will be to her to see
a new face, and I declare when she hears you are new out from Scotland
she will simply revel in you.We are about to confer a great favor upon
Mrs.If Moira had any lingering doubts as to the soundness of her
sister-in-law's opinion they vanished before the welcome she had from
the minister's wife.she cried, with both hands extended, "and just
out from Scotland?And our folk came
from near Inverness.Mhail Gaelic heaibh?"And on they went for some minutes in what Mrs.Macintyre called "the
dear old speech," till Mrs.Macintyre, remembering herself, said to
Mandy:

"But you do not understand the Gaelic?And to think that in this far land I should find a young lady like this
to speak it to me!Do you know, I am forgetting it out here."All the
while she was speaking she was laying the cloth and setting the table."And you have come all the way from Calgary this morning?Would you lie down upon the
bed for an hour?Then come away in to the bedroom and fresh yourselves
up a bit."We are a big party," said Mandy, "for your wee house.We have a friend
with us--Dr.Indeed I know him well, and a fine man he is and that kind
and clever."Let me go for them," said Mandy."But are you quite sure," asked Mandy, "you can--you have everything
handy?Macintyre, I know just how hard it is to keep a
stock of everything on hand.""Well, we have bread and molasses--our butter is run out, it is hard to
get--and some bacon and potatoes and tea.And we have some things with us, if you don't
mind."The clean linen, the shining dishes,
the silver--for Mrs.Macintyre brought out her wedding presents--gave
the table a brilliantly festive appearance in the eyes of those who had
lived for some years in the western country."You don't appreciate the true significance of a table napkin, I venture
to say, Miss Cameron," said the doctor, "until you have lived a year in
this country at least, or how much an unspotted table cloth means, or
shining cutlery and crockery.""Well, I have been two days at the Royal Hotel, whatever," replied
Moira."Our most palatial
Western hostelry--all the comforts and conveniences of civilization!""Anyway, I like this better," said Moira."You have paid me a very fine tribute."The hour lengthened into two, for when a departure was suggested the
doctor grew eloquent in urging delay.The horses would be all the better
for the rest.They could easily
make the Black Dog Ford before dark.After that the trail was good for
twenty miles, where they would camp.But like all happy hours these
hours fled past, and all too swiftly, and soon the travelers were ready
to depart.Before the Stopping Place door Hell was holding down the bronchos, while
Cameron was packing in the valises and making all secure again.Near the
wagon stood the doctor waiting their departure."You are going back from here, Dr."Yes," said the doctor, "I am going back.""It has been good to see you," she said."I hope next time you will know
me.""Ah, now, Miss Cameron, don't rub it in.My picture of the girl I had
seen in the Highlands that day never changed and never will change."The
doctor's keen gray eyes burned into hers for a moment.A slight flush
came to her cheek and she found herself embarrassed for want of words.Her embarrassment was relieved by the sound of hoofs pounding down the
trail.said the doctor, as they stood watching the
horseman approaching at a rapid pace and accompanied by a cloud of dust.Nearer and nearer he came, still on the gallop till within a few yards
of the group."Whoever he is he will run us down!"and she sprang
into her place in the democrat.Without slackening rein the rider came up to the Stopping Place door
at a full gallop, then at a single word his horse planted his four feet
solidly on the trail, and, plowing up the dirt, came to a standstill;
then, throwing up his magnificent head, he gave a loud snort and stood,
a perfect picture of equine beauty."I do not," said the doctor, conscious of a feeling of hostility to
the stranger, and all the more because he was forced to acknowledge to
himself that the rider and his horse made a very striking picture.The
man was tall and sinewy, with dark, clean-cut face, thin lips, firm chin
and deep-set, brown-gray eyes that glittered like steel, and with that
unmistakable something in his bearing that suggested the breeding of a
gentleman.His coal black
skin shone like silk, his flat legs, sloping hips, well-ribbed barrel,
small head, large, flashing eyes, all proclaimed his high breeding.breathed Moira again to the doctor.As if in answer to her praise the stranger, raising his Stetson, swept
her an elaborate bow, and, touching his horse, moved nearer to the door
of the Stopping Place and swung himself to the ground."Ah, Cameron, it's you, sure enough.But he made no motion to offer his hand nor did he introduce him
to the company.Martin started and swept
his keen eyes over the stranger's face.inquired the stranger whom Cameron had saluted as Raven."Fit
as ever," a hard smile curling his lips as he noted Cameron's omission.he continued, his eyes falling upon that individual, who
was struggling with the restive ponies, "how goes it with your noble
self?"Hastily Hell, leaving the bronchos for the moment, responded, "Hello,
Mr.Meantime the bronchos, freed from Hell's supervision, and apparently
interested in the strange horse who was viewing them with lordly
disdain, turned their heads and took the liberty of sniffing at the
newcomer.Instantly, with mouth wide open and ears flat on his head, the
black horse rushed at the bronchos.With a single bound they were off,
the lines trailing in the dust.Together Hell, Cameron and the doctor
sprang for the wagon, but before they could touch it it was whisked from
underneath their fingers as the bronchos dashed in a mad gallop down the
trail, Moira meantime clinging desperately to the seat of the pitching
wagon.After them darted Cameron and for some moments it seemed as if
he could overtake the flying ponies, but gradually they drew away and he
gave up the chase.After him followed the whole company, his wife, the
doctor, Hell, all in a blind horror of helplessness.cried Cameron, his breath coming in sobbing gasps.Hardly were the words out of his mouth when Raven came up at an easy
canter."Don't worry," he said quietly to Mandy, who was wringing her hands in
despair, "I'll get them."Like a swallow for swiftness and for grace, the black stallion sped
away, flattening his body to the trail as he gathered speed.The
bronchos had a hundred yards of a start, but they had not run another
hundred until the agonized group of watchers could see that the stallion
was gaining rapidly upon them."He'll get 'em," cried Hell, "he'll get 'em, by gum!""But can he turn them from the bank?""If anything in horse-flesh or man-flesh can do it," said Hell, "it'll
be done."But a tail-race is a long race and a hundred yards' start is a serious
handicap in a quarter of a mile.Down the sloping trail the bronchos
were running savagely, their noses close to earth, their feet on the
hard ground like the roar of a kettledrum, their harness and trappings
fluttering over their backs, the wagon pitching like a ship in a gale,
the girl clinging to its high seat as a sailor to a swaying mast.Behind, and swiftly drawing level with the flying bronchos, sped the
black horse, still with that smooth grace of a skimming swallow and
with such ease of motion as made it seem as if he could readily have
increased his speed had he so chosen.Martin, his
stark face and staring eyes proclaiming his agony.The agonized watchers saw the rider lean far over the bronchos and seize
one line, then gradually begin to turn the flying ponies away from the
cut bank and steer them in a wide circle across the prairie.cried the doctor brokenly, wiping
the sweat from his face."Let us go to head them off," said Cameron, setting off at a run,
leaving the doctor and his wife to follow.As they watched with staring eyes the racing horses they saw Raven bring
back the line to the girl clinging to the wagon seat, then the black
stallion, shooting in front of the ponies, began to slow down upon them,
hampering their running till they were brought to an easy canter, and,
under the more active discipline of teeth and hoofs, were forced to a
trot and finally brought to a standstill, and so held till Cameron and
the doctor came up to them."Raven," gasped Cameron, fighting for his breath and coming forward with
hand outstretched, "you have--done--a great thing--to-day--for me."Tut tut, Cameron, simple thing.I fancy you are still a few points
ahead," said Raven, taking his hand in a strong grip."After all, it was
Night Hawk did it.""You saved--my sister's life," continued Cameron, still struggling for
breath."Perhaps, perhaps, but I don't forget," and here Raven leaned over his
saddle and spoke in a lower voice, "I don't forget the day you saved
mine, my boy.""Come," said Cameron, "let me present you to my sister."he commanded, and the horse stood like a soldier on
guard."Moira," said Cameron, still panting hard, "this is--my friend--Mr.Raven stood bowing before her with his hat in his hand, but the girl
leaned far down from her seat with both hands outstretched.Raven," she said in a quiet voice, but her brown eyes
were shining like stars in her white face."I could not have done it, Miss Cameron," said Raven, a wonderfully
sweet smile lighting up his hard face, "I could not have done it had you
ever lost your nerve.""I had no fear after I saw your face," said the girl simply."Ah, and how did you know that?"His gray-brown eyes searched her face
more keenly.Martin," said Cameron as the doctor
came up."I--too--want to thank you--Mr.Raven," said the doctor, seizing him
with both hands."I never can--we never can forget it--or repay you.""Oh," said Raven, with a careless laugh, "what else could I do?After
all it was Night Hawk did the trick."He lifted his hat again to Moira,
bowed with a beautiful grace, threw himself on his horse and stood till
the two men, after carefully examining the harness and securing the
reins, had climbed to their places on the wagon seat.Then he trotted on before toward the Stopping Place, where the
minister's wife and indeed the whole company of villagers awaited them.cried Moira, with her eyes upon the rider in
front of them."Yes--he is--he is a chap I met when I was on the Force.""No, no," replied her brother hastily.Ah--yes, yes, he is a rancher I fancy.That is--I have seen little of him--in fact--only a couple of times--or
so.""He seems to know you, Allan," said his sister a little reproachfully."Anyway," she continued with a deep breath, "he is just splendid."Martin glanced at her face glowing with enthusiasm and was shamefully
conscious of a jealous pang at his heart."He is just splendid,"
continued Moira, with growing enthusiasm, "and I mean to know more of
him."said her brother sharply, as if waking from a dream.You do not know what you are talking about."Oh, never mind just now, Moira.In this country we don't take up with
strangers."echoed the girl, pain mingling with her surprise."Yes, thank God, he saved your life," cried her brother, "and we shall
never cease to be grateful to him, but--but--oh, drop it just now
please, Moira.You don't know and--here we are.To this neither made reply, but there came a day when both doubted such
a possibility.CHAPTER XI

SMITH'S WORK


The short September day was nearly gone.The sun still rode above the
great peaks that outlined the western horizon.Already the shadows were
beginning to creep up the eastern <DW72> of the hills that clambered till
they reached the bases of the great mountains.A purple haze hung over
mountain, hill and rolling plain, softening the sharp outlines that
ordinarily defined the features of the foothill landscape.With the approach of evening the fierce sun heat had ceased and a
fresh cooling western breeze from the mountain passes brought welcome
refreshment alike to the travelers and their beasts, wearied with their
three days' drive."That is the last hill, Moira," cried her sister-in-law, pointing to a
long <DW72> before them.From the top
we can see our home.There is no home
there, only a black spot on the prairie."Her husband grunted savagely and cut sharply at the bronchos."But the tent will be fine, Mandy.I just long for the experience," said
Moira."Yes, but just think of all my pretty things, and some of Allan's too,
all gone."No--no--you remember, Allan, young--what's his
name?--that young Highlander at the Fort wanted them.""Sure enough--Macgregor," said her husband in a tone of immense relief."My, but that is fine, Allan," said his sister."I should have grieved
if we could not hear the pipes again among these hills.Oh, it is all so
bonny; just look at the big Bens yonder."It was, as she said, all bonny.Far toward their left the low hills
rolled in soft swelling waves toward the level prairie, and far away to
the right the hills climbed by sharper ascents, flecked here and
there with dark patches of fir, and broken with jutting ledges of gray
limestone, climbed till they reached the great Rockies, majestic in
their massive serried ranges that pierced the western sky.And all that
lay between, the hills, the hollows, the rolling prairie, was bathed
in a multitudinous riot of color that made a scene of loveliness beyond
power of speech to describe."Oh, Allan, Allan," cried his sister, "I never thought to see anything
as lovely as the Cuagh Oir, but this is up to it I do believe.""It must indeed be lovely, then," said her brother with a smile, "if
you can say that."Here we are, just at the top," cried Mandy."In a minute beyond the
shoulder there we shall see the Big Horn Valley and the place where our
home used to be.Exclamations of amazement burst from Cameron
and his wife."It is the trail all right," said her husband in a low voice, "but what
in thunder does this mean?""It is a house, Allan, a new house.""It looks like it--but--"

"And there are people all about!"For some breathless moments they gazed upon the scene.A wide valley,
flanked by hills and threaded by a gleaming river, lay before them and
in a bend of the river against the gold and yellow of a poplar bluff
stood a log house of comfortable size gleaming in all its newness fresh
from the ax and saw.The bronchos seemed to catch her excitement, their weariness
disappeared, and, pulling hard on the bit, they tore down the winding
trail as if at the beginning rather than at the end of their hundred and
fifty mile drive.Where in the world can they have come from?""There's the Inspector, anyway," said Cameron."He is at the bottom of
this, I'll bet you."Dent, and, oh, there's my friend Smith!You
remember he helped me put out the fire."Soon they were at the gate of the corral where a group of men and women
stood awaiting them.Inspector Dickson was first:

"Hello, Cameron!Cameron," he said as
he helped her to alight.Smith stood at the bronchos' heads."Now, Inspector," said Cameron, holding him by hand and collar, "now
what does this business mean?"After all had been presented to his sister Cameron pursued his question.Cochrane, tell me," cried Mandy, "who began this?""Don't rightly know how the thing started.First thing I knowed they was
all at it.""See here, Thatcher, you might as well own up.Where did the logs come from, for instance?"Guess Bracken knows," replied Cochrane, turning to a tall, lanky
rancher who was standing at a little distance."Bracken," cried Cameron, striding to him with hand outstretched, "what
about the logs for the house?Smith was sayin' somethin' about a bee and gettin' green
logs."cried Cameron, glancing at that individual now busy unhitching
the bronchos."And of course," continued Bracken, "green logs ain't any use for a real
good house, so--and then--well, I happened to have a bunch of logs up
the Big Horn.Cameron, and inspect your house," cried a stout,
red-faced matron."I said they ought to await your coming to get your
plans, but Mr.Smith said he knew a little about building and that they
might as well go on with it.It was getting late in the season, and so
they went at it.Come away, we're having a great time over it.Indeed, I
think we've enjoyed it more than ever you will.""But you haven't told us yet who started it," cried Mandy."Well, the lumber," replied Cochrane, "came from the Fort, I guess."We had no immediate use for it, and Smith
told us just how much it would take."But Smith was already
leading the bronchos away to the stable."Yes," continued the Inspector, "and Smith was wondering how a notice
could be sent up to the Spruce Creek boys and to Loon Lake, so I sent a
man with the word and they brought down the lumber without any trouble.But," continued the Inspector, "come along, Cameron, let us follow the
ladies.""But this is growing more and more mysterious," protested Cameron."Can
no one tell me how the thing originated?The sash and doors now, where
did they come from?""Oh, that's easy," said Cochrane."I was at the Post Office, and,
hearin' Smith talkin' 'bout this raisin' bee and how they were stuck for
sash and door, so seein' I wasn't goin' to build this fall I told him he
might as well have the use of these.My team was laid up and Smith got
Jim Bracken to haul 'em down.""Well, this gets me," said Cameron."It appears no one started this
thing.Now the shingles, I suppose they just
tumbled up into their place there."Didn't know there
were any in the country.""Oh, they just got up into place there of themselves I have no doubt,"
said Cameron.Funny thing, don't-che-naow,"
chimed in a young fellow attired in rather emphasized cow-boy style,
"funny thing!A Johnnie--quite a strangah to me, don't-che-naow, was
riding pawst my place lawst week and mentioned about this--ah--raisin'
bee he called it I think, and in fact abaout the blawsted Indian, and
the fire, don't-che-naow, and all the rest of it, and how the chaps were
all chipping in as he said, logs and lumbah and so fowth.And then, bay
Jove, he happened to mention that they were rathah stumped for shingles,
don't-che-naow, and, funny thing, there chawnced to be behind my
stable a few bunches, and I was awfully glad to tu'n them ovah, and
this--eh--pehson--most extraordinary chap I assuah you--got 'em down
somehow.""Don't naow him in the least.But it's the chap that seems to be bossing
the job.""Oh, that's Smith," said Cochrane.He
was good enough to help my wife to beat back the fire.I don't believe I
even spoke to him."Yes, but--"

"Come away, Mr.Cochrane from the door of the new
house."Come away in and look at the result of our bee.""This beats me," said Cameron, obeying the invitation, "but, say,
Dickson, it is mighty good of all these men.I have no claim--"

"Claim?"We must stand
together in this country, and especially these days, eh, Inspector?Cochrane," he added in a low voice, "it is
very necessary that as little as possible should be said about these
things just now."All right, Inspector, I understand, but--"

"What do you think of your new house, Mr.Now what do you think of this for three days' work?""Oh, Allan, I have been all through it and it's perfectly wonderful,"
said his wife.Cameron," said Cochrane, "but it will
do for a while.""Perfectly wonderful in its whole plan, and beautifully complete,"
insisted Mandy."See, a living-room, a lovely large one, two bedrooms
off it, and, look here, cupboards and closets, and a pantry, and--" here
she opened the door in the corner--"a perfectly lovely up-stairs!Not to
speak of the cook-house out at the back.""Wonderful is the word," said Cameron, "for why in all the world should
these people--?""And look, Allan, at Moira!She's just lost in rapture over that
fireplace.""And I don't wonder," said her husband.he continued, moving toward Moira's side, who was standing
before a large fireplace of beautiful masonry set in between the two
doors that led to the bedrooms at the far end of the living-room."It was Andy Hepburn from Loon Lake that built it," said Mr."I wish I could thank him," said Moira fervently."Well, there he is outside the window, Miss Moira," said a young fellow
who was supposed to be busy putting up a molding round the wainscoting,
but who was in reality devoting himself to the young lady at the present
moment with open admiration."Here, Andy," he cried through the window,
"you're wanted.A hairy little man, with a face dour and unmistakably Scotch, came in.he asked, with a deliberate sort of gruffness."It's yourself, Andy, me boy," said young Dent, who, though Canadian
born, needed no announcement of his Irish ancestry."It is yourself,
Andy, and this young lady, Miss Moira Cameron--Mr.Hepburn--" Andy made
reluctant acknowledgment of her smile and bow--"wants to thank you for
this fireplace."Hepburn, and very thankful I am to you
for building it.""Aw, it's no that bad," admitted Andy."Aye did I. But no o' ma ain wull.A fireplace is a feckless thing in
this country an' I think little o't."He juist keepit dingin' awa' till A promised
if he got the lime--A kent o' nane in the country--A wud build the
thing.""And he got the lime, eh, Andy?""Aye, he got it," said Andy sourly."But I am sure you did it beautifully, Mr.Hepburn," said Moira, moving
closer to him, "and it will be making me think of home."Her soft
Highland accent and the quaint Highland phrasing seemed to reach a soft
spot in the little Scot.he inquired, manifesting a grudging interest.Where but in the best of all lands, in Scotland," said Moira."Aye, an' did ye say, lassie!"said Andy, with a faint accession of
interest."It's a bonny country ye've left behind, and far enough frae
here.""Far indeed," said Moira, letting her shining brown eyes rest upon his
face.But when the fire burns yonder,"
she added, pointing to the fireplace, "I will be seeing the hills and
the glens and the moors.""'Deed, then, lassie," said Andy in a low hurried voice, moving toward
the door, "A'm gled that Smith buddie gar't me build it."Hepburn," said Moira, shyly holding out her hand, "don't you
think that Scotties in this far land should be friends?""An' prood I'd be, Miss Cameron," replied Andy, and, seizing her hand,
he gave it a violent shake, flung it from him and fled through the door."He's a cure, now, isn't he!""I think he is fine," said Moira with enthusiasm."It takes a Scot to
understand a Scot, you see, and I am glad I know him.Do you know, he
is a little like the fireplace himself," she said, "rugged, a wee bit
rough, but fine."Meanwhile the work of inspecting the new house was going on.Everywhere
appeared fresh cause for delighted wonder, but still the origin of the
raising bee remained a mystery.Balked by the men, Cameron turned in his search to the women and
proceeded to the tent where preparations were being made for the supper.Cochrane, her broad good-natured face
beaming with health and good humor, "what difference does it make?Your neighbors are only too glad of a chance to show their goodwill for
yourself, and more for your wife.""I am sure you are right there," said Cameron."And it is the way of the country.It's your turn to-day, it may be ours to-morrow and that's all there
is to it.So clear out of this tent and make yourself busy.By the way,
where's the pipes?The folk will soon be asking for a tune.""Where's the pipes, I'm saying.John," she cried, lifting her voice, to
her husband, who was standing at the other side of the house.They're not burned, I hope," she continued, turning to
Cameron."The whole settlement would feel that a loss."Young Macgregor at the Fort has them."John, find out from the Inspector
yonder where the pipes are.To her husband's inquiry the Inspector replied that if Macgregor ever
had the pipes it was a moral certainty that he had carried them with him
to the raising, "for it is my firm belief," he added, "that he sleeps
with them.""Do go and see now, like a dear man," said Mrs.From group to group of the workers Cameron went, exchanging greetings,
but persistently seeking to discover the originator of the raising
bee.But all in vain, and in despair he came back to his wife with the
question "Who is this Smith, anyway?"Smith," she said with deliberate emphasis, "is my friend, my
particular friend.I found him a friend when I needed one badly."inquired Moira, who, with Mr.Dent in attendance,
had sauntered up."No, not from Adam's mule.A
subtle note of disappointment sounded in her voice.There is no such thing as servant west of the Great Lakes in this
country.A man may help me with my work for a consideration, but he is
no servant of mine as you understand the term, for he considers himself
just as good as I am and he may be considerably better.""Oh, Allan," protested his sister with flushing face, "I know.I know
all that, but you know what I mean.""Yes, I know perfectly," said her brother, "for I had the same notion.For instance, for six months I was a'servant' in Mandy's home, eh,
Mandy?""You were our hired man and just
like the rest of us.""Do you get that distinction, Moira?There is no such thing as servant
in this country," continued Cameron."We are all the same socially and
stand to help each other."Yes, fine," cried Moira, "but--" and she paused, her face still
flushed."Well, then,
Miss Cameron, between you and me we don't ask that question in this
country.Smith is Smith and Jones is Jones and that's the first and last
of it.But now the last row of shingles was in place, the last door hung, the
last door-knob set.The whole house stood complete, inside and out, top
and bottom, when a tattoo beat upon a dish pan gave the summons to the
supper table.The table was spread in all its luxurious variety and
abundance beneath the poplar trees.There the people gathered all upon
the basis of pure democratic equality, "Duke's son and cook's son," each
estimated at such worth as could be demonstrated was in him.Fictitious
standards of values were ignored.Every man was given his fair
opportunity to show his stuff and according to his showing was his place
in the community.A generous good fellowship and friendly good-will
toward the new-comer pervaded the company, but with all this a kind of
reserve marked the intercourse of these men with each other.Men were
taken on trial at face value and no questions asked.This evening, however, the dominant note was one of generous and
enthusiastic sympathy with the young rancher and his wife, who had come
so lately among them and who had been made the unfortunate victim of
a sinister and threatening foe, hitherto, it is true, regarded with
indifference or with friendly pity but lately assuming an ominous
importance.There was underneath the gay hilarity of the gathering an
undertone of apprehension until the Inspector made his speech.It was
short and went straight at the mark.It would be idle to ignore that there were ugly rumors flying.There was
need for watchfulness, but there was no need for alarm.The Police Force
was charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives and property
of the people.They assumed to the full this responsibility, though they
were very short-handed at present, but if they ever felt they needed
assistance they knew they could rely upon the steady courage of the men
of the district such as he saw before him.There was need of no further words and the Inspector's speech passed
with no response.It was not after the manner of these men to make
demonstration either of their loyalty or of their courage.Cameron's speech at the last came haltingly.On the one hand his
Highland pride made it difficult for him to accept gifts from any source
whatever.On the other hand his Highland courtesy forbade his giving
offense to those who were at once his hosts and his guests, but none
suspected the reason for the halting in his speech.As Western men they
rather approved than otherwise the hesitation and reserve that marked
his words.Before they rose from the supper table, however, there were calls for
Mrs.Cameron, calls so insistent and clamorous that, overcoming her
embarrassment, she made reply."We have not yet found out who was
responsible for the originating of this great kindness.We forgive him, for otherwise my husband and I would never have come to
know how rich we are in true friends and kind neighbors, and now that
you have built this house let me say that henceforth by day or by night
you are welcome to it, for it is yours."After the storm of applause had died down, a voice was heard gruffly and
somewhat anxiously protesting, "But not all at one time."asked Mandy of young Dent as the supper party broke up."That's Smith," said Dent, "and he's a queer one."But there was a universal and insistent demand for "the pipes.""You look him up, Mandy," cried her husband as he departed in response
to the call."I shall find him, and all about him," said Mandy with determination.The next two hours were spent in dancing to Cameron's reels, in which
all, with more or less grace, took part till the piper declared he was
clean done."Let Macgregor have the pipes, Cameron," cried the Inspector."He is
longing for a chance, I am sure, and you give us the Highland Fling.""Come Moira," cried Cameron gaily, handing the pipes to Macgregor and,
taking his sister by the hand, he led her out into the intricacies of
the Highland Reel, while the sides of the living-room, the doors and
the windows, were thronged with admiring onlookers.Even Andy Hepburn's
rugged face lost something of its dourness; and as the brother and
sister together did that most famous of all the ancient dances of
Scotland, the Highland Fling, his face relaxed into a broad smile."There's Smith," said young Dent to Mandy in a low voice as the reel was
drawing to a close.Even in the dim light of the lanterns and candles hung here and there
upon the walls and stuck on the window sills, Smith's face, pale, stern,
sad, shone like a specter out of the darkness behind.Suddenly the reel came to an end and Cameron, taking the pipes from
young Macgregor, cried, "Now, Moira, we will give them our way of it,"
and, tuning the pipes anew, he played over once and again their own Glen
March, known only to the piper of the Cuagh Oir.Then with cunning
skill making atmosphere, he dropped into a wild and weird lament, Moira
standing the while like one seeing a vision.With a swift change the
pipes shrilled into the true Highland version of the ancient reel,
enriched with grace notes and variations all his own.For a few moments
the girl stood as if unwilling to yield herself to the invitation of the
pipes.Suddenly, as if moved by another spirit than her own, she stepped
into the circle and whirled away into the mazes of the ancient style of
the Highland Fling, such as is mastered by comparatively few even of the
Highland folk.With wonderful grace and supple strength she passed from
figure to figure and from step to step, responding to the wild mad music
as to a master spirit.In the midst of the dance Mandy made her way out of the house and round
to the window where Smith stood gazing in upon the dancer.She quietly
approached him from behind and for a few moments stood at his side.He
was breathing heavily like a man in pain.she said, touching him gently on the shoulder.He sprang from her touch as from a stab and darted back from the crowd
about the window.He stood a moment or two gazing at her with staring eyes and parted
lips, pain, grief and even rage distorting his pale face."It is wicked," at length he panted."It is just terrible wicked--a
young girl like that.""That--that girl--dancing like that.""I was brought
up a Methodist myself," she continued, "but that kind of dancing--why, I
love it."I am a Methodist--a preacher--but I could not
preach, so I quit.But that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil
and--and I have not the courage to denounce it.She is--God help
me--so--so wonderful--so wonderful."Smith," said Mandy, laying her hand upon his arm, and seeking
to sooth his passion, "surely this dancing is--"

Loud cheers and clapping of hands from the house interrupted her.The
man put his hands over his eyes as if to shut out a horrid vision,
shuddered violently, and with a weird sound broke from her touch and
fled into the bluff behind the house just as the party came streaming
from the house preparatory to departing.It seemed to Mandy as if she
had caught a glimpse of the inner chambers of a soul and had seen things
too sacred to be uttered.Among the last to leave were young Dent and the Inspector."We have found out the culprit," cried Dent, as he was saying
good-night."The fellow who has engineered this whole business.""Who got the logs from Bracken?Who
got the Inspector to send men through the settlement?Who got the
lumber out of the same Inspector?And the sash and doors out of
Cochrane?And wiggled the shingles out of Newsome?And euchred
old Scotty Hepburn into building the fireplace?And planned and bossed
the whole job?We have not thanked him,"
said Cameron."He is gone, I think," said Mandy.But I am sure we owe a great deal to you, Inspector
Dickson, to you, Mr.Dent, and indeed to all our friends," she added, as
she bade them good-night.For some moments they lingered in the moonlight."To think that this is Smith's work!"said Cameron, waving his hand
toward the house.One thing I have learned, never to
judge a man by his legs again.""He is a fine fellow," said Mandy indignantly, "and with a fine soul in
spite of--"

"His wobbly legs," said her husband smiling.What difference does it make what kind of legs a
man has?""Very true," replied her husband smiling, "and if you knew your Bible
better, Mandy, you would have found excellent authority for your
position in the words of the psalmist, 'The Lord taketh no pleasure in
the legs of a man.'But, say, it is a joke," he added, "to think of this
being Smith's work."CHAPTER XII

IN THE SUN DANCE CANYON


But they were not yet done with Smith, for as they turned to pass into
the house a series of shrill cries from the bluff behind pierced the
stillness of the night.Shaking off the clutching hands of his wife and sister, Cameron darted
into the bluff and found two figures frantically struggling upon the
ground.The moonlight trickling through the branches revealed the man
on top to be an Indian with a knife in his hand, but he was held in such
close embrace that he could not strike.cried Cameron, seizing the Indian by the wrist.The under man released his grip, allowed the Indian to rise and got
himself to his feet.said Cameron sharply, leading the Indian
out of the bluff, followed by the other, still panting."Now, then, what the deuce is all this row?"Well, this beats me," said her
husband.For some moments Cameron stood surveying the group, the Indian
silent and immobile as one of the poplar trees beside him, the ladies
with faces white, Smith disheveled in garb, pale and panting and
evidently under great excitement.Smith's pale face flushed a swift red, visible even in the moonlight,
then grew pale again, his excited panting ceased as he became quiet."I found this Indian in the bush here and I seized him.I thought--he
might--do something.""Yes--some mischief--to some of you."You found this Indian in the bluff here and you just jumped on
him?You might better have jumped on a wild cat.Are you used to this
sort of thing?And he would have in two
minutes more.""He might have killed--some of you," said Smith."Now what were you doing in the bluff?"he said sharply, turning to the
Indian."Chief Trotting Wolf," said the Indian in the low undertone common to
his people, "Chief Trotting Wolf want you' squaw--boy seeck bad--leg
beeg beeg.He turned to Mandy and repeated
"Come--queeek--queeek.""Too much mans--no
like--Indian wait all go 'way--dis man much beeg fight--no good.Come
queeek--boy go die.""Let us hurry, Allan," she said."You can't go to-night," he replied.She turned into the house, followed by her
husband, and began to rummage in her bag."Lucky thing I got these
supplies in town," she said, hastily putting together her nurse's
equipment and some simple remedies.Doctor want cut off leg--dis," his action was sufficiently
suggestive."Talk much--all day--all night.""He is evidently in a high fever," said Mandy to her husband.Now, my dear, you hurry and get the horses.""But what shall we do with Moira?""Why," cried Moira, "let me go with you.But this did not meet with Cameron's approval."I can stay here," suggested Smith hesitatingly, "or Miss Cameron can go
over with me to the Thatchers'.""We can drop her at the
Thatchers' as we pass."In half an hour Cameron returned with the horses and the party proceeded
on their way.At the Piegan Reserve they were met by Chief Trotting Wolf himself and,
without more than a single word of greeting, were led to the tent in
which the sick boy lay.Beside him sat the old squaw in a corner of the
tent, crooning a weird song as she swayed to and fro.The sick boy lay
on a couch of skins, his eyes shining with fever, his foot festering
and in a state of indescribable filth and his whole condition one of
unspeakable wretchedness.Cameron found his gorge rise at the sight of
the gangrenous ankle."This is a horrid business, Mandy," he exclaimed.But his wife, from the moment of her first sight of the wounded foot,
forgot all but her mission of help."We must have a clean tent, Allan," she said, "and plenty of hot water.Cameron turned to the Chief and said, "Hot water, quick!""Huh--good," replied the Chief, and in a few moments returned with a
small pail of luke-warm water."Oh," cried Mandy, "it must be hot and we must have lots of it.""Huh," grunted the Chief a second time with growing intelligence, and
in an incredibly short space returned with water sufficiently hot and in
sufficient quantity.All unconscious of the admiring eyes that followed the swift and skilled
movements of her capable hands, Mandy worked over the festering and
fevered wound till, cleansed, soothed, wrapped in a cooling lotion, the
limb rested easily upon a sling of birch bark and skins suggested and
prepared by the Chief.Then for the first time the boy made a sound."Huh," he grunted feebly.Me two
foot--live--one foot--" he held up one finger--"die."His eyes were
shining with something other than the fever that drove the blood racing
through his veins.As a dog's eyes follow every movement of his master
so the lad's eyes, eloquent with adoring gratitude, followed his nurse
as she moved about the wigwam."Now we must get that clean tent, Allan.""It will be no easy job, but we shall do
our best.Here, Chief," he cried, "get some of your young men to pitch
another tent in a clean place."The Chief, eager though he was to assist, hesitated.And so while the squaws were pitching a tent in a spot somewhat removed
from the encampment, Cameron poked about among the tents and wigwams of
which the Indian encampment consisted, but found for the most part
only squaws and children and old men.He came back to his wife greatly
disturbed."The young bucks are gone, Mandy.You ask for a messenger to be sent
to the fort for the doctor and medicine.I shall enclose a note to the
Inspector.We want the doctor here as soon as possible and we want Jerry
here at the earliest possible moment."With a great show of urgency a messenger was requisitioned and
dispatched, carrying a note from Cameron to the Commissioner requesting
the presence of the doctor with his medicine bag, but also requesting
that Jerry, the redoubtable half-breed interpreter and scout, with
a couple of constables, should accompany the doctor, the constables,
however, to wait outside the camp until summoned.During the hours that must elapse before any answer could be had from
the fort, Cameron prepared a couch in a corner of the sick boy's tent
for his wife, and, rolling himself in his blanket, he laid himself
down at the door outside where, wearied with the long day and its many
exciting events, he slept without turning, till shortly after daybreak
he was awakened by a chorus of yelping curs which heralded the arrival
of the doctor from the fort with the interpreter Jerry in attendance.After breakfast, prepared by Jerry with dispatch and skill, the product
of long experience, there was a thorough examination of the sick boy's
condition through the interpreter, upon the conclusion of which a long
consultation followed between the doctor, Cameron and Mandy.It was
finally decided that the doctor should remain with Mandy in the Indian
camp until a change should become apparent in the condition of the boy,
and that Cameron with the interpreter should pick up the two constables
and follow in the trail of the young Piegan braves.In order to allay
suspicion Cameron and his companion left the camp by the trail which led
toward the fort.For four miles or so they rode smartly until the trail
passed into a thick timber of spruce mixed with poplar.Here Cameron
paused, and, making a slight sign in the direction from which they had
come, he said:

"Drop back, Jerry, and see if any Indian is following.""Go slow one mile," and, slipping from his
pony, he handed the reins to Cameron and faded like a shadow into the
brushwood.For a mile Cameron rode, pausing now and then to listen for the sound of
anyone following, then drew rein and waited for his companion.After a
few minutes of eager listening he suddenly sat back in his saddle and
felt for his pipe."All right, Jerry," he said softly, "come out."Grinning somewhat shamefacedly Jerry parted a bunch of spruce boughs and
stood at Cameron's side."Good ears," he said, glancing up into Cameron's face."No, Jerry," replied Cameron, "I saw the blue-jay.""Huh," grunted Jerry, "dat fool bird tell everyt'ing.""Two Indian run tree mile--find notting--go back."Any news at the fort last two or three days?"Louis Riel
mak beeg spik--beeg noise--blood!Jerry's tone indicated the completeness of his contempt for the whole
proceedings at St."Well, there's something doing here," continued Cameron."Trotting
Wolf's young men have left the reserve and Trotting Wolf is very
anxious that we should not know it.I want you to go back, find out what
direction they have taken, how far ahead they are, how many.We camp
to-night at the Big Rock at the entrance to the Sun Dance Canyon."There's something doing, Jerry, or I am much mistaken."Me--here--t'ree day," tapping his rolled blanket
at the back of his saddle."Odder fellers--grub--Jakes--t'ree men--t'ree
day.Come Beeg Rock to-night--mebbe to-morrow."So saying, Jerry climbed
on to his pony and took the back trail, while Cameron went forward to
meet his men at the Swampy Creek Coulee.Making a somewhat wide detour to avoid the approaches to the Indian
encampment, Cameron and his two men rode for the Big Rock at the
entrance to the Sun Dance Canyon.They gave themselves no concern about
Trotting Wolf's band of young men.They knew well that what Jerry could
not discover would not be worth finding out.A year's close association
with Jerry had taught Cameron something of the marvelous powers of
observation, of the tenacity and courage possessed by the little
half-breed that made him the keenest scout in the North West Mounted
Police.At the Big Rock they arrived late in the afternoon and there waited
for Jerry's appearing; but night had fallen and had broken into morning
before the scout came into camp with a single word of report:

"Notting.""Eat something, Jerry, then we will talk," said Cameron.Jerry had already broken his fast, but was ready for more.After the
meal was finished he made his report.On leaving Cameron in the morning he had taken the most likely direction
to discover traces of the Piegan band, namely that suggested by Cameron,
and, fetching a wide circle, had ridden toward the mountains, but he
had come upon no sign.Then he had penetrated into the canyon and ridden
down toward the entrance, but still had found no trace.He had then
ridden backward toward the Piegan Reserve and, picking up a trail of one
or two ponies, had followed it till he found it broaden into that of a
considerable band making eastward.Then he knew he had found the trail
he wanted.The half-breed held up both hands three times."Blood Reserve t'ink--dunno.""There is no sense in them going to the Blood Reserve, Jerry," said
Cameron impatiently."The Bloods are a pack of thieves, we know, but our
people are keeping a close watch on them.""There is no big Indian camping ground on the Blood Reserve.You
wouldn't get the Blackfeet to go to any pow-wow there.""How far did you follow their trail, Jerry?"It seemed
unlikely that if the Piegan band were going to a rendezvous of Indians
they should select a district so closely under the inspection of the
Police.Furthermore there was no great prestige attaching to the Bloods
to make their reserve a place of meeting."Jerry," said Cameron at length, "I believe they are up this Sun Dance
Canyon somewhere.""I believe, Jerry, they doubled back and came in from the north end
after you had left.I feel sure they are up there now and we will go and
find them."Finally he took his pipe from
his mouth, pressed the tobacco hard down with his horny middle finger
and stuck it in his pocket."Mebbe so," he said slowly, a slight grin distorting his wizened little
face, "mebbe so, but t'ink not--me.""Well, Jerry, where could they have gone?They might ride straight
to Crowfoot's Reserve, but I think that is extremely unlikely.They
certainly would not go to the Bloods, therefore they must be up this
canyon.We will go up, Jerry, for ten miles or so and see what we can
see.""Good," said Jerry with a grunt, his tone conveying his conviction that
where the chief scout of the North West Mounted Police had said it was
useless to search, any other man searching would have nothing but his
folly for his pains.We need not start for a couple of hours."Jerry grunted his usual reply, rolled himself in his blanket and, lying
down at the back of a rock, was asleep in a minute's time.In two hours to the minute he stood beside his pony waiting for Cameron,
who had been explaining his plan to the two constables and giving them
his final orders.They were to wait where they were
till noon.If any of the band of Piegans appeared one of the men was
to ride up the canyon with the information, the other was to follow
the band till they camped and then ride back till he should meet his
comrades.They divided up the grub into two parts and Cameron and the
interpreter took their way up the canyon.The canyon consisted of a deep cleft across a series of ranges of hills
or low mountains.Through it ran a rough breakneck trail once used by
the Indians and trappers but now abandoned since the building of the
Canadian Pacific Railway through the Kicking Horse Pass and the opening
of the Government trail through the Crow's Nest.From this which had
once been the main trail other trails led westward into the Kootenays
and eastward into the Foothill country.At times the canyon widened into
a valley, rich in grazing and in streams of water, again it narrowed
into a gorge, deep and black, with rugged sides above which only the
blue sky was visible, and from which led cavernous passages that wound
into the heart of the mountains, some of them large enough to hold a
hundred men or more without crowding.These caverns had been and
still were found to be most convenient and useful for the purpose of
whisky-runners and of cattle-rustlers, affording safe hiding-places for
themselves and their spoil.With this trail and all its ramifications
Jerry was thoroughly familiar.The only other man in the Force who
knew it better than Jerry was Cameron himself.For many months he had
patroled the main trail and all its cross leaders, lived in its caves
and explored its caverns in pursuit of those interesting gentlemen whose
activities more than anything else had rendered necessary the existence
of the North West Mounted Police.In ancient times the caves along the
Sun Dance Trail had been used by the Indian Medicine-Men for their pagan
rites, and hence in the eyes of the Indians to these caves attached a
dreadful reverence that made them places to be avoided in recent years
by the various tribes now gathered on the reserves.But during these
last months of unrest it was suspected by the Police that the ancient
uses of these caves had been revived and that the rites long since
fallen into desuetude were once more being practised.For the first few miles of the canyon the trail offered good footing
and easy going, but as the gorge deepened and narrowed the difficulties
increased until riding became impossible, and only by the most strenuous
efforts on the part of both men and beasts could any advance be made.And so through the day and into the late evening they toiled on, ever
alert for sight or sound of the Piegan band."We must camp, Jerry," he said."We are making no time and we may spoil
things.I know a good camp-ground near by.""Me too," grunted Jerry, who was as tired as his wiry frame ever allowed
him to become.They took a trail leading eastward, which to all eyes but those familiar
with it would have been invisible, for a hundred yards or so and came
to the bed of a dry stream which issued from between two great rocks.Behind one of these rocks there opened out a grassy plot a few yards
square, and beyond the grass a little lifted platform of rock against a
sheer cliff.Here they camped, picketing their horses on the grass and
cooking their supper upon the platform of rock over a tiny fire of dry
twigs, for the wind was blowing down the canyon and they knew that they
could cook their meal and have their smoke without fear of detection.For some time after supper they sat smoking in that absolute silence
which is the characteristic of the true man of the woods.The gentle
breeze blowing down the canyon brought to their ears the rustling of
the dry poplar-leaves and the faint murmur of the stream which, tumbling
down the canyon, accompanied the main trail a hundred yards away.Suddenly Cameron's hand fell upon the knee of the half-breed with a
swift grip.With mouths slightly open and with hands to their ears they both sat
motionless, breathless, every nerve on strain.Gradually the dead
silence seemed to resolve itself into rhythmic waves of motion rather
than of sound--"TUM-ta-ta-TUM.TUM-ta-ta-TUM.TUM-ta-ta-TUM."It was
the throb of the Indian medicine-drum, which once heard can never be
forgotten or mistaken.Without a word to each other they rose, doused
their fire, cached their saddles, blankets and grub, and, taking only
their revolvers, set off up the canyon.Before they had gone many yards
Cameron halted."I take it they have come in the
back way over the old Porcupine Trail.""Then we can go in from the canyon.It is hard going, but there is less
fear of detection.They are sure to be in the Big Wigwam."Jerry shook his head, with a puzzled look on his face."That is where they are," said Cameron.Steadily the throb of the medicine-drum grew more distinct as they moved
slowly up the canyon, rising and falling upon the breeze that came down
through the darkness to meet them.The trail, which was bad enough in
the light, became exceedingly dangerous and difficult in the blackness
of the night.On they struggled painfully, now clinging to the sides of
the gorge, now mounting up over a hill and again descending to the level
of the foaming stream."Will they have sentries out, I wonder?"whispered Cameron in Jerry's
ear."No--beeg medicine going on--no sentry.""All right, then, we will walk straight in on them.""We will see what they are doing and send them about their business,"
said Cameron shortly."S'pose Indian mak beeg medicine--bes' leave
him go till morning.""Well, Jerry, we will take a look at them at any rate," said Cameron."But if they are fooling around with any rebellion nonsense I am going
to step in and stop it.""No," said Jerry again very gravely."Beeg medicine mak' Indian man
crazy--fool--dance--sing--mak' brave--then keel--queeck!""Come along, then, Jerry," said Cameron impatiently.The throb of the drum grew clearer until it seemed that the next turn in
the trail should reveal the camp, while with the drum throb they began
to catch, at first faintly and then more clearly, the monotonous chant
"Hai-yai-kai-yai, Hai-yai-kai-yai," that ever accompanies the Indian
dance.Suddenly the drums ceased altogether and with it the chanting,
and then there arose upon the night silence a low moaning cry that
gradually rose into a long-drawn penetrating wail, almost a scream, made
by a single voice.Jerry's hand caught Cameron's arm with a convulsive grip."Sioux Indian--he mak' dat when he go keel."Once more the long weird wailing scream pierced the night and, echoing
down the canyon, was repeated a hundred times by the black rocky sides.Cameron could feel Jerry's hand still quivering on his arm."Me hear dat when A'm small boy--me."Then Cameron remembered that it was Sioux blood that  the
life-stream in Jerry's veins.But he was
more shaken than he cared to acknowledge by that weird unearthly cry
and by its all too obvious effect upon the iron nerves of that little
half-breed at his side."Dey mak' dat cry when dey go meet Custer long 'go," said Jerry, making
no motion to go forward."Come along, unless
you want to go back."His words stung the half-breed into action.Cameron could feel him in
the dark jerk his hand away and hear him grit his teeth."That is better," said Cameron cheerfully."Now we will look in upon
these fire-eaters."Sharp to the right they turned behind a cliff, and then back almost upon
their trail, still to the right, through a screen of spruce and poplar,
and found themselves in a hole of a rock that lengthened into a tunnel
blacker than the night outside.Pursuing this tunnel some little
distance they became aware of a light that grew as they moved toward
it into a fire set in the middle of a wide cavern.The cavern was of
irregular shape, with high-vaulted roof, open to the sky at the apex and
hung with glistening stalactites.The floor of this cavern lay slightly
below them, and from their position they could command a full view of
its interior.The sides of the cavern round about were crowded with tawny faces of
Indians arranged rank upon rank, the first row seated upon the ground,
those behind crouching upon their haunches, those still farther back
standing.In the center of the cavern and with his face lit by the fire
stood the Sioux Chief, Onawata."He mak' beeg spik," he said."He say Indian long tam' 'go have all country when his fadder small boy.Dem day good hunting--plenty beaver, mink, moose, buffalo like leaf on
tree, plenty hit (eat), warm wigwam, Indian no seeck, notting wrong.Dem
day Indian lak' deer go every place.Dem day Indian man lak' bear 'fraid
notting.Good tam', happy, hunt deer, keel buffalo, hit all day.The half-breed's voice faded in two long gasps.The Sioux's chanting voice rose and fell through the vaulted cavern like
a mighty instrument of music.His audience of crowding Indians gazed
in solemn rapt awe upon him.The whole circle
swayed in unison with his swaying form as he chanted the departed
glories of those happy days when the red man roamed free those plains
and woods, lord of his destiny and subject only to his own will.The
mystic magic power of that rich resonant voice, its rhythmic cadence
emphasized by the soft throbbing of the drum, the uplifted face glowing
as with prophetic fire, the tall swaying form instinct with exalted
emotion, swept the souls of his hearers with surging tides of passion.Cameron, though he caught but little of its meaning, felt himself
irresistibly borne along upon the torrent of the flowing words.He
glanced at Jerry beside him and was startled by the intense emotion
showing upon his little wizened face.Suddenly there was a swift change of motif, and with it a change of
tone and movement and color.The marching, vibrant, triumphant chant
of freedom and of conquest subsided again into the long-drawn wail of
defeat, gloom and despair.He knew the
singer was telling the pathetic story of the passing of the day of the
Indian's glory and the advent of the day of his humiliation.With sharp
rising inflections, with staccato phrasing and with fierce passionate
intonation, the Sioux wrung the hearts of his hearers.Again Cameron
glanced at the half-breed at his side and again he was startled to note
the transformation in his face.Where there had been glowing pride there
was now bitter savage hate.For that hour at least the half-breed was
all Sioux.His father's blood was the water in his veins, the red was
only his Indian mother's.With face drawn tense and lips bared into
a snarl, with eyes gleaming, he gazed fascinated upon the face of the
singer.In imagination, in instinct, in the deepest emotions of his soul
Jerry was harking back again to the savage in him, and the savage in him
thirsting for revenge upon the white man who had wrought this ruin upon
him and his Indian race.With a fine dramatic instinct the Sioux reached
his climax and abruptly ceased.A low moaning murmur ran round the
circle and swelled into a sobbing cry, then ceased as suddenly as there
stepped into the circle a stranger, evidently a half-breed, who began to
speak.He was a French Cree, he announced, and delivered his message in
the speech, half Cree, half French, affected by his race.He had come fresh from the North country, from the disturbed district,
and bore, as it appeared, news of the very first importance from those
who were the leaders of his people in the unrest.At his very first
word Jerry drew a long deep breath and by his face appeared to drop from
heaven to earth.As the half-breed proceeded with his tale his speech
increased in rapidity.said Cameron after they had listened for
some minutes.said Jerry, whose vocabulary had been learned
mostly by association with freighters and the Police."He tell 'bout
beeg meeting, beeg man Louis Riel mak' beeg noise.The whole scene had lost for Jerry its mystic impressiveness and had
become contemptibly commonplace.This was the
part that held meaning for him.So he pulled up the half-breed with a
quick, sharp command."Listen close," he said, "and let me know what he says."And as Jerry interpreted in his broken English the half-breed's speech
it appeared that there was something worth learning.At this big
meeting held in Batoche it seemed a petition of rights, to the Dominion
Parliament no less, had been drawn up, and besides this many plans had
been formed and many promises made of reward for all those who dared to
stand for their rights under the leadership of the great Riel, while
for the Indians very special arrangements had been made and the most
alluring prospects held out.For they were assured that, when in the far
North country the new Government was set up, the old free independent
life of which they had been hearing was to be restored, all hampering
restrictions imposed by the white man were to be removed, and the
good old days were to be brought back.The effect upon the Indians was
plainly evident.With solemn faces they listened, nodding now and
then grave approval, and Cameron felt that the whole situation held
possibilities of horror unspeakable in the revival of that ancient
savage spirit which had been so very materially softened and tamed
by years of kindly, patient and firm control on the part of those
who represented among them British law and civilization.His original
intention had been to stride in among these Indians, to put a stop to
their savage nonsense and order them back to their reserves with never a
thought of anything but obedience on their part.But as he glanced about
upon the circle of faces he hesitated.This was no petty outbreak of
ill temper on the part of a number of Indians dissatisfied with their
rations or chafing under some new Police regulation.As his eye traveled
round the circle he noted that for the most part they were young men.A few of the councilors of the various tribes represented were present.Many of them he knew, but many others he could not distinguish in the
dim light of the fire.And as Jerry ran over the names he began to realize how widely
representative of the various tribes in the western country the
gathering was.Practically every reserve in the West was represented:
Bloods, Piegans and Blackfeet from the foothill country, Plain Crees and
Wood Crees from the North.Even a few of the Stonies, who were supposed
to have done with all pagan rites and to have become largely civilized,
were present.They were the
picked braves of the tribes, and with them a large number of the younger
chiefs.At length the half-breed Cree finished his tale, and in a few brief
fierce sentences he called the Indians of the West to join their
half-breed and Indian brothers of the North in one great effort to
regain their lost rights and to establish themselves for all time in
independence and freedom.Then followed grave discussion carried on with deliberation and courtesy
by those sitting about the fire, and though gravity and courtesy marked
every utterance there thrilled through every speech an ever deepening
intensity of feeling.The fiery spirit of the red man, long subdued by
those powers that represented the civilization of the white man, was
burning fiercely within them.The insatiable lust for glory formerly won
in war or in the chase, but now no longer possible to them, burned in
their hearts like a consuming fire.The life of monotonous struggle for
a mere existence to which they were condemned had from the first been
intolerable to them.The prowess of their fathers, whether in the
slaughter of foes or in the excitement of the chase, was the theme of
song and story round every Indian camp-fire and at every sun dance.For the young braves, life, once vivid with color and thrilling with
tingling emotions, had faded into the somber-hued monotony of a dull and
spiritless existence, eked out by the charity of the race who had robbed
them of their hunting-grounds and deprived them of their rights as free
men.The lust for revenge, the fury of hate, the yearning for the return
of the days of the red man's independence raged through their speeches
like fire in an open forest; and, ever fanning yet ever controlling the
flame, old Copperhead presided till the moment should be ripe for such
action as he desired.Should they there and then pledge themselves to their Northern brothers
and commit themselves to this great approaching adventure?Quietly and with an air of judicial deliberation the Sioux put the
question to them.There was something to be lost and something to be
gained.And the gain, how
immeasurable!A few scattered settlers with no arms nor ammunition, with
no means of communication, what could they effect?A Government nearly
three thousand miles away, with the nearest base of military operations
a thousand miles distant, what could they do?The only real difficulty
was the North West Mounted Police.But even as the Sioux uttered the
words a chill silence fell upon the excited throng.The North West
Mounted Police, who for a dozen years had guarded them and cared for
them and ruled them without favor and without fear!Five hundred red
coats of the Great White Mother across the sea, men who had never been
known to turn their backs upon a foe, who laughed at noisy threats and
whose simple word their greatest chief was accustomed unhesitatingly to
obey!Small wonder that the mere mention of the name of those gallant
"Riders of the Plains" should fall like a chill upon their fevered
imaginations.The Sioux was conscious of that chill and set himself to
counteract it.he cried with unspeakable scorn, "the Police!They will
flee before the Indian braves like leaves before the autumn wind."Without a moment's hesitation Cameron sprang to his feet and, standing
in the dim light at the entrance to the cave, with arm outstretched and
finger pointed at the speaker, he cried:

"Listen!"With a sudden start every face was turned in his direction.Never have the Indians seen a Policeman's back turned in
flight."His unexpected appearance, his voice ringing like the blare of a trumpet
through the cavern, his tall figure with the outstretched accusing arm
and finger, the sharp challenge of the Sioux's lie with what they all
knew to be the truth, produced an effect utterly indescribable.For
some brief seconds they gazed upon him stricken into silence as with a
physical blow, then with a fierce exclamation the Sioux snatched a rifle
from the cave side and quicker than words can tell fired straight at
the upright accusing figure.But quicker yet was Jerry's panther-spring.With a backhand he knocked Cameron flat, out of range.Cameron dropped
to the floor as if dead."What the deuce do you mean, Jerry?""You nearly knocked the
wind out of me!"grunted Jerry fiercely, dragging him back into the
tunnel out of the light.cried Cameron in a rage, struggling to free himself
from the grip of the wiry half-breed.hissed Jerry, laying his hand over Cameron's mouth."Indian mad--crazy--tak' scalp sure queeck.""Let me go, Jerry, you little fool!""I'll kill you if you
don't!I want that Sioux, and, by the eternal God, I am going to have
him!"He shook himself free of the half-breed's grasp and sprang to his
feet.cried Jerry again, flinging himself upon him and winding his
arms about him.Indian mad crazy--keel quick--no
talk--now."Up and down the tunnel Cameron dragged him about as a mastiff might
a terrier, striving to free himself from those gripping arms.Even as
Jerry spoke, through the dim light the figure of an Indian could be seen
passing and repassing the entrance to the cave."We get him soon," said Jerry in an imploring whisper."Come back
now--queeck--beeg hole close by."With a great effort Cameron regained his self-control."By Jove, you are right, Jerry," he said quietly."We certainly can't
take him now.This
passage opens on to the canyon about fifty yards farther down.Follow,
and keep your eye on the Sioux.Without an instant's hesitation Jerry obeyed, well aware that his master
had come to himself and again was in command.Cameron meantime groped to the mouth of the tunnel by which he had
entered and peered out into the dim light.Close to his hand stood an
Indian in the cavern.Beyond him there was a confused mingling of forms
as if in bewilderment.The Council was evidently broken up for the time.The Indians were greatly shaken by the vision that had broken in upon
them.That it was no form of flesh and blood was very obvious to them,
for the Sioux's bullet had passed through it and spattered against the
wall leaving no trail of blood behind it.There was no holding them
together, and almost before he was aware of it Cameron saw the cavern
empty of every living soul.Quickly but warily he followed, searching
each nook as he went, but the dim light of the dying fire showed him
nothing but the black walls and gloomy recesses of the great cave.At
the farther entrance he found Jerry awaiting him."Beeg camp close by," replied Jerry.Some
talk-talk, then go sleep.Chief Onawata he mak' more talk--talk all
night--then go sleep.Now you get back quick for the men
and come to me here in the morning.We must not spoil the chance of
capturing this old devil.He will have these Indians worked up into
rebellion before we know where we are."So saying, Cameron set forward that he might with his own eyes look upon
the camp and might the better plan his further course.First, that he should break up this council
which held such possibilities of danger to the peace of the country.And
secondly, and chiefly, he must lay hold of this Sioux plotter, not only
because of the possibilities of mischief that lay in him, but because of
the injury he had done him and his.Forward, then, he went and soon came upon the camp, and after observing
the lay of it, noting especially the tent in which the Sioux Chief had
disposed himself, he groped back to his cave, in a nook of which--for
he was nearly done out with weariness, and because much yet lay before
him--he laid himself down and slept soundly till the morning.CHAPTER XIII

IN THE BIG WIGWAM


Long before the return of the half-breed and his men Cameron was astir
and to some purpose.A scouting expedition around the Indian camp
rewarded him with a significant and useful discovery.In a bluff some
distance away he found the skins and heads of four steers, and by
examination of the brands upon the skins discovered two of them to be
from his own herd."All right, my braves," he muttered."There will be a reckoning for this
some day not so far away.Meantime this will help this day's work."A night's sleep and an hour's quiet consideration had shown him the
folly of a straight frontal attack upon the Indians gathered for
conspiracy.They were too deeply stirred for anything like the usual
brusque manner of the Police to be effective.A slight indiscretion,
indeed, might kindle such a conflagration as would sweep the whole
country with the devastating horror of an Indian war.He recalled the
very grave manner of Inspector Dickson and resolved upon an entirely
new plan of action.At all costs he must allay suspicion that the Police
were at all anxious about the situation in the North.Further, he must
break the influence of the Sioux Chief over these Indians.Lastly, he
was determined that this arch-plotter should not escape him again.The sun was just visible over the lowest of the broken foothills when
Jerry and the two constables made their appearance, bringing, with them
Cameron's horse.After explaining to them fully his plan and emphasizing
the gravity of the situation and the importance of a quiet, cool and
resolute demeanor, they set off toward the Indian encampment."I have no intention of stirring these chaps up," laid Cameron, "but I
am determined to arrest old Copperhead, and at the right moment we must
act boldly and promptly.He is too dangerous and much too clever to be
allowed his freedom among these Indians of ours at this particular time.Now, then, Jerry and I will ride in looking for cattle and prepared to
charge these Indians with cattle-stealing.This will put them on the
defensive.You two will remain within sound
of whistle, but failing specific direction let each man act on his own
initiative."Before the
day was over he was to see him in an entirely new role.Nothing in life
afforded Jerry such keen delight as a bit of cool daring successfully
carried through.Hence with joyous heart he followed Cameron into the
Indian camp.The morning hour is the hour of coolest reason.The fires of emotion and
imagination have not yet begun to burn.The reactions from anything
like rash action previously committed under the stimulus of a heated
imagination are caution and timidity, and upon these reactions Cameron
counted when he rode boldly into the Indian camp.With one swift glance his eye swept the camp and lighted upon the Sioux
Chief in the center of a group of younger men, his tall commanding
figure and haughty carriage giving him an outstanding distinction over
those about him.At his side stood a young Piegan Chief, Eagle Feather
by name, whom Cameron knew of old as a restless, talkative Indian, an
ambitious aspirant for leadership without the qualities necessary to
such a position."Ah, good morning, Eagle
Feather!"Eagle Feather grunted an indistinct reply.Are you in command of this party, Eagle Feather?The Piegan turned and pointed to a short thick set man standing by
another fire, whose large well shaped head and penetrating eye indicated
both force and discretion.I
am glad to see you, for I wish to talk to a man of wisdom."Slowly and with dignified, almost unwilling step Running Stream
approached.As he began to move, but not before, Cameron went to meet
him."I wish to talk with you," said Cameron in a quiet firm tone."I have a matter of importance to speak to you about," continued
Cameron.Running Stream's keen glance searched his face somewhat anxiously."I find, Running Stream, that your young men are breaking faith with
their friends, the Police."Again the Chief searched Cameron's face with that keen swift glance, but
he said not a word, only waited."They are breaking the law as well, and I want to tell you they will be
punished.Where did they get the meat for these kettles?"A look of relief gleamed for one brief instant across the Indian's face,
not unnoticed, however, by Cameron."Why do your young men steal my cattle?""Dunno--deer--mebbe--sheep.""My brother speaks like a child," said Cameron quietly."Do deer and
sheep have steers' heads and hides with brands on?The Commissioner will ask you to explain these hides and
heads, and let me tell you, Running Stream, that the thieves will spend
some months in jail.They will then have plenty of time to think of
their folly and their wickedness."An ugly glance shot from the Chief's eyes."Dunno," he grunted again, then began speaking volubly in the Indian
tongue."I know you can
speak English well enough."But Running Stream shook his head and continued his speech in Indian,
pointing to a bluff near by.Cameron looked toward Jerry, who interpreted:

"He say young men tak' deer and sheep and bear."Come," said Running Stream, supplementing Jerry's interpretation and
making toward the bluff.Cameron followed him and came upon the skins of
three jumping deer, of two mountain sheep and of two bear."My young men no take cattle," said the Chief with haughty pride."Maybe so," said Cameron, "but some of your party have, Running Stream,
and the Commissioner will look to you.He will
give you a chance to clear yourself.""My brother is not doing well," continued Cameron."The Government feed
you if you are hungry.The Government protect you if you are wronged."A sudden cloud of anger
darkened the Indian's face."My children--my squaw and my people go hungry--go
cold in winter--no skin--no meat.""My brother knows--" replied Cameron with patient firmness--"You
translate this, Jerry"--and Jerry proceeded to translate with eloquence
and force--"the Government never refuse you meat.Last winter your
people would have starved but for the Government.""No," cried the Indian again in harsh quick reply, the rage in his
face growing deeper, "my children cry--Indian cannot sleep--my white
brother's ears are closed.He hear only the wind--the storm--he sound
sleep.For me no sleep--my children cry too loud.""My brother knows," replied Cameron, "that the Government is far away,
that it takes a long time for answer to come back to the Indian cry.But the answer came and the Indian received flour and bacon and tea and
sugar, and this winter will receive them again.But how can my brother
expect the Government to care for his people if the Indians break the
law?These Indians are bad Indians and the Police will
punish the thieves.A thief is a bad man and ought to be punished."Suddenly a new voice broke in abruptly upon the discourse."Who steal the Indian's hunting-ground?It was the voice of Onawata, the Sioux
Chief.Cameron paid no heed to the ringing voice.He kept his back turned upon
the Sioux."My brother knows," he continued, addressing himself to Running Stream,
"that the Indian's best friend is the Government, and the Police are the
Government's ears and eyes and hands and are ready always to help the
Indians, to protect them from fraud, to keep away the whisky-peddlers,
to be to them as friends and brothers.But my brother has been listening
to a snake that comes from another country and that speaks with a forked
tongue.Running Stream knows
this to be no lie, but the truth.Nor did the Government drive away the
buffalo from the Indians.The buffalo were driven away by the Sioux from
the country of the snake with the forked tongue.My brother remembers
that only a few years ago when the people to which this lying snake
belongs came over to this country and tried to drive away from their
hunting-grounds the Indians of this country, the Police protected the
Indians and drove back the hungry thieving Sioux to their own land.And
now a little bird has been telling me that this lying snake has been
speaking into the ears of our Indian brothers and trying to persuade
them to dig up the hatchet against their white brothers, their friends.The Police know all about this and laugh at it.The Police know about
the foolish man at Batoche, the traitor Louis Riel.They know he is
a liar and a coward.He leads brave men astray and then runs away and
leaves them to suffer.And Cameron
proceeded to give a brief sketch of the fantastic and futile rebellion
of 1870 and of the ignoble part played by the vain and empty-headed
Riel.The effect of Cameron's words upon the Indians was an amazement even to
himself.They forgot their breakfast and gathered close to the speaker,
their eager faces and gleaming eyes showing how deeply stirred were
their hearts.Cameron was putting into his story an intensity of emotion and passion
that not only surprised himself, but amazed his interpreter.Indeed so
amazed was the little half-breed at Cameron's quite unusual display of
oratorical power that his own imagination took fire and his own tongue
was loosened to such an extent that by voice, look, tone and gesture he
poured into his officer's harangue a force and fervor all his own."And now," continued Cameron, "this vain and foolish Frenchman seeks
again to lead you astray, to lead you into war that will bring ruin
to you and to your children; and this lying snake from your ancient
enemies, the Sioux, thinking you are foolish children, seeks to make
you fight against the great White Mother across the seas.He has been
talking like a babbling old man, from whom the years have taken wisdom,
when he says that the half-breeds and Indians can drive the white man
from these plains.Has he told you how many are the children of the
White Mother, how many are the soldiers in her army?Get me many branches from the trees," he commanded sharply to some
young Indians standing near.So completely were the Indians under the thrall of his speech that a
dozen of them sprang at once to get branches from the poplar trees near
by."I will show you," said Cameron, "how many are the White Mother's
soldiers.See,"--he held up both hands and then stuck up a small twig in
the sand to indicate the number ten.Ten of these small twigs he set in
a row and by a larger stick indicated a hundred, and so on till he had
set forth in the sandy soil a diagrammatic representation of a hundred
thousand men, the Indians following closely his every movement."And all
these men," he continued, "are armed with rifles and with great big guns
that speak like thunder.And these are only a few of the White Mother's
soldiers.How many Indians and half-breeds do you think there are with
rifles?"He set in a row sticks to represent a thousand men."See," he
cried, "so many.""Perhaps, if all
the Indians gathered, so many with rifles.Now look," he said,
"no big guns, only a few bullets, a little powder, a little food.My Indian brothers here will not listen to him, but
there are others whose hearts are like the hearts of little children who
may listen to his lying words.The Sioux snake must be caught and put in
a cage, and this I do now."As he uttered the words Cameron sprang for the Sioux, but quicker than
his leap the Sioux darted through the crowding Indians who, perceiving
Cameron's intent, thrust themselves in his path and enabled the Sioux to
get away into the brush behind."Head him off, Jerry," yelled Cameron, whistling sharply at the same
time for his men, while he darted for his horse and threw himself upon
it.The whole camp was in a seething uproar.The Indians fell away from him
like waves from a speeding vessel.On the other side of the little bluff
he caught sight of a mounted Indian flying toward the mountains and with
a cry he started in pursuit.It took only a few minutes for Cameron to
discover that he was gaining rapidly upon his man.But the rough rocky
country was not far away in front of them, and here was abundant chance
for hiding.Closer and closer he drew to his flying enemy--a hundred
yards--seventy-five yards--fifty yards only separated them.But the Indian, throwing himself on the far side of his pony, urged him
to his topmost speed.Cameron steadied himself for a moment, took careful aim and fired.The
flying pony stumbled, recovered himself, stumbled again and fell.But
even before he reached the earth his rider had leaped free, and, still
some thirty yards in advance, sped onward.Half a dozen strides and
Cameron's horse was upon him, and, giving him the shoulder, hurled the
Indian senseless to earth.In a flash Cameron was at his side, turned
him over and discovered not the Sioux Chief but another Indian quite
unknown to him.His rage and disappointment were almost beyond his control.For an
instant he held his gun poised as if to strike, but the blow did not
fall.He put up his gun, turned quickly
away from the prostrate Indian, flung himself upon his horse and set off
swiftly for the camp.It was but a mile distant, but in the brief
time consumed in reaching it he had made up his mind as to his line of
action.Unless his men had captured the Sioux it was almost certain that
he had made his escape to the canyon, and once in the canyon there was
little hope of his being taken.It was of the first importance that he
should not appear too deeply concerned over his failure to take his man.With this thought in his mind Cameron loped easily into the Indian camp.He found the young braves in a state of feverish excitement.Armed with
guns and clubs, they gathered about their Chiefs clamoring to be allowed
to wipe out these representatives of the Police who had dared to attempt
an arrest of this distinguished guest of theirs.As Cameron appeared
the uproar quieted somewhat and the Indians gathered about him, eagerly
waiting his next move.Cameron cantered up to Running Stream and, looking round upon the
crowding and excited braves, he said, with a smile of cool indifference:

"The Sioux snake has slid away in the grass.After he has eaten we will have
some quiet talk."So saying, he swung himself from his saddle, drew the reins over his
horse's ears and, throwing himself down beside a camp fire, he pulled
out his pipe and proceeded to light it as calmly as if sitting in a
council-lodge.Nothing appeals more strongly
to the Indian than an exhibition of steady nerve.For some moments they
stood regarding Cameron with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration
with a strong admixture of impatience, for they had thought of being
done out of their great powwow with its attendant joys of dance and
feast, and if this Policeman should choose to remain with them all day
there could certainly be neither dancing nor feasting for them.In the
meantime, however, there was nothing for it but to accept the situation
created for them.This cool-headed Mounted Policeman had planted himself
by their camp-fire.They could not very well drive him from their camp,
nor could they converse with him till he was ready.As they were thus standing about in uncertainty of mind and temper
Jerry, the interpreter, came in and, with a grunt of recognition, threw
himself down by Cameron beside the fire.After some further hesitation
the Indians began to busy themselves once more with their breakfast.In
the group about the campfire beside which Cameron had placed himself was
the Chief, Running Stream.The presence of the Policeman beside his fire
was most embarrassing to the Chief, for no man living has a keener sense
of the obligations of hospitality than has the Indian.But the Indian
hates to eat in the presence of a white man unless the white man shares
his meal.Hence Running Stream approached Cameron with a courteous
request that he would eat with them."Thanks, Running Stream, I have eaten, but I am sure Jerry here will
be glad of some breakfast," said Cameron cordially, who had no desire
whatever to dip out of the very doubtful mess in the pot which had been
set down on the ground in the midst of the group around the fire.Jerry, however, had no scruples in the matter and, like every Indian
and half-breed, was always ready for a meal.Having thus been offered
hospitality and having by proxy accepted it, Cameron was in position to
discuss with the Chief in a judicial if not friendly spirit the matter
he had in hand.Breakfast over, Cameron offered his tobacco-pouch to the Chief, who,
gravely helping himself to a pipeful, passed it on to his neighbor who,
having done likewise, passed it in turn to the man next him till the
tobacco was finished and the empty pouch returned with due gravity to
the owner.Relations of friendly diplomacy being thus established, the whole party
sat smoking in solemn silence until the pipes were smoked out.Then
Cameron, knocking the ashes from his pipe, opened up the matter in hand,
with Jerry interpreting."The Sioux snake," he began quietly, "will be hungry for his breakfast."Huh," grunted Running Stream, non-committal."The Police will get him in due time," continued Cameron in a tone of
quiet indifference."He will cease to trouble our Indian brothers with
foolish lies.The prison gates are strong and will soon close upon this
stranger with the forked tongue."Again the Chief grunted, still non-committal."It would be a pity if any of your young men should give heed to these
silly tales.In the Sioux country
there is frequent war between the soldiers and the Indians because bad
men wish to wrong the Indians and the Indians grow angry and fight, but
in this country white men are punished who do wrong to Indians."Huh," grunted Running Stream acquiescing."When Indians do wrong to white men it is just that the Indians should
be punished as well.The Police do justly between the white man and the
Indian."Huh," again grunted Running Stream with an uneasy look on his face."Therefore when young and foolish braves steal and kill cattle they must
be punished.Here Cameron's voice
grew gentle as a child's, but there was in its tone something that made
the Chief glance quickly at his face."Huh, my young men no steal cattle," he said sullenly.I believe that is true, and that is why I
smoke with my brother beside his camp fire.But some young men in this
band have stolen cattle, and I want my brother to find them that I might
take them with me to the Commissioner.""Not know any Indian take cattle," said Running Stream in surly
defiance."There are four skins and four heads lying in the bluff up yonder,
Running Stream.I am going to take those with me to the Commissioner and
I am sure he would like to see you about those skins."Cameron's manner
continued to be mild but there ran through his speech an undertone of
stern resolution that made the Indian squirm a bit."Not know any Indian take cattle," repeated Running Stream, but with
less defiance."Then it would be well for my brother to find out the thieves, for," and
here Cameron paused and looked the Chief steadily in the face for a few
moments, "for we are to take them back with us or we will ask the Chief
to come and explain to the Commissioner why he does not know what his
young men are doing.""No Blackfeet Indian take cattle," said the Chief once more."Then it must be the Bloods, or the Piegans or the
Stonies.He had determined to spend
the day if necessary in running down these thieves.At his suggestion
Running Stream called together the Chiefs of the various bands of
Indians represented.From his supplies Cameron drew forth some more
tobacco and, passing it round the circle of Chiefs, calmly waited until
all had smoked their pipes out, after which he proceeded to lay the case
before them.The Police believe them to be honest
men, but unfortunately among them there have crept in some who are not
honest.In the bluff yonder are four hides and four heads of steers, two
of them from my own herd.Some bad Indians have stolen and killed these
steers and they are here in this camp to-day, and I am going to take
them with me to the Commissioner.Running Stream is a great Chief and
speaks no lies and he tells me that none of his young men have taken
these cattle.Will the Chief of the Stonies, the Chief of the Bloods,
the Chief of the Piegans say the same for their young men?""The Stonies take no cattle," answered an Indian whom Cameron recognized
as the leading representative of that tribe present.What about the Bloods and the Piegans?""It is not for me," he continued, when there was no reply, "to discover
the cattle-thieves.It is for the Big Chief of this camp, it is for you,
Running Stream, and when you have found the thieves I shall arrest them
and bring them to the Commissioner, for I will not return without them.Meantime I go to bring here the skins."So saying, Cameron rode leisurely away, leaving Jerry to keep an eye
upon the camp.For more than an hour they talked among themselves, but
without result.Finally they came to Jerry, who, during his years
with the Police, had to a singular degree gained the confidence of the
Indians.There had been much stealing
of cattle by some of the tribes, not by all.The Police had been
patient, but they had become weary.They had their suspicions as to the
thieves.Eagle Feather was anxious to know what Indians were suspected."Not the Stonies and not the Blackfeet," replied Jerry quietly.It was
a pity, he continued, that innocent men should suffer for the guilty.He
knew Running Stream was no thief, but Running Stream must find out the
thieves in the band under his control.How would Running Stream like to
have the great Chief of the Blackfeet, Crowfoot, know that he could not
control the young men under his command and did not know what they were
doing?This suggestion of Jerry had a mighty effect upon the Blackfeet Chief,
for old Crowfoot was indeed a great Chief and a mighty power with his
band, and to fall into disfavor with him would be a serious matter for
any junior Chief in the tribe.Again they withdrew for further discussion and soon it became evident
that Jerry's cunning suggestions had sown seeds of discord among them.The dispute waxed hot and fierce, not as to the guilty parties, who were
apparently acknowledged to be the Piegans, but as to the course to be
pursued.Running Stream had no intention that his people and himself
should become involved in the consequences of the crimes of other
tribes whom the Blackfeet counted their inferiors.Eagle Feather and his
Piegans must bear the consequences of their own misdeeds.On the other
hand Eagle Feather pleaded hard that they should stand together in this
matter, that the guilty parties could not be disclosed.The Police could
not punish them all, and all the more necessary was it that they should
hold together because of the larger enterprise into which they were
about to enter.The absence of the Sioux Chief Onawata, however, weakened the bond of
unity which he more than any other had created and damped the ardor of
the less eager of the conspirators.It was likewise a serious blow to
their hopes of success that the Police knew all their plans.Running
Stream finally gave forth his decision, which was that the thieves
should be given up, and that they all should join in a humble petition
to the Police for leniency, pleading the necessity of hunger on their
hunting-trip, and, as for the larger enterprise, that they should
apparently abandon it until suspicion had been allayed and until the
plans of their brothers in the North were more nearly matured.The time
for striking had not yet come.In this decision all but the Piegans agreed.In vain Eagle Feather
contended that they should stand together and defy the Police to prove
any of them guilty.In vain he sought to point out that if in this
crisis they surrendered the Piegans to the Police never again could they
count upon the Piegans to support them in any enterprise.But Running
Stream and the others were resolved.At the very moment in which this decision had been reached Cameron rode
in, carrying with him the incriminating hides."You take charge of these and bring them to the
Commissioner.""All right," said Jerry, taking the hides from Cameron's horse.said Cameron in a low voice as the half-breed was
untying the bundle.Quietly Cameron walked over to the group of excited Indians.As he
approached they opened their circle to receive him."My brother has discovered the thief," he said."And after all a thief
is easily found among honest men."Slowly and deliberately his eye traveled round the circle of faces,
keenly scrutinizing each in turn.When he came to Eagle Feather he
paused, gazed fixedly at him, took a single step in his direction, and,
suddenly leveling an accusing finger at him, cried in a loud voice:

"I have found him.Slowly he walked up to the Indian, who remained stoically motionless,
laid his hand upon his wrist and said in a clear ringing voice heard
over the encampment:

"Eagle Feather, I arrest you in the name of the Queen!"And before
another word could be spoken or a movement made Eagle Feather stood
handcuffed, a prisoner.CHAPTER XIV

"GOOD MAN--GOOD SQUAW"


"That boy is worse, Mrs.Cameron, decidedly worse, and I wash my hands
of all responsibility."Mandy sat silent, weary with watching and weary with the conflict that
had gone on intermittently during the past three days.The doctor
was determined to have the gangrenous foot off.That was the simplest
solution of the problem before him and the foot would have come off days
ago if he had had his way.But the Indian boy had vehemently opposed
this proposal."One foot--me go die," was his ultimatum, and through
all the fever and delirium this was his continuous refrain.In this
determination his nurse supported him, for she could not bring herself
to the conviction that amputation was absolutely necessary, and,
besides, of all the melancholy and useless driftwood that drives hither
and thither with the ebb and flow of human life, she could imagine none
more melancholy and more useless than an Indian crippled of a foot.Hence she supported the boy in his ultimatum, "One foot--me go die.""That foot ought to come off," repeated the doctor, beginning the
controversy anew."But, doctor," said Mandy wearily, "just think how pitiable, how
helpless that boy will be.And, besides, I have not
quite given up hope that--"

The doctor snorted his contempt for her opinion; and only his respect
for her as Cameron's wife and for the truly extraordinary powers and
gifts in her profession which she had displayed during the past three
days held back the wrathful words that were at his lips.It was late in
the afternoon and the doctor had given many hours to this case, riding
back and forward from the fort every day, but all this he would not have
grudged could he have had his way with his patient."Well, I have done my best," he said, "and now I must go back to my
work.""I know, doctor, I know," pleaded Mandy."You have been most kind and
I thank you from my heart.""Don't
think me too awfully obstinate, and please forgive me if you do."The doctor took the outstretched hand grudgingly."Of all the obstinate creatures--"

"Oh, I am afraid I am.You see, the
boy is so splendidly plucky and such a fine chap.""He is a fine chap, doctor, and I can't bear to have him crippled,
and--" She paused abruptly, her lips beginning to quiver.She was near
the limit of her endurance."You would rather have him dead, eh?All right, if that suits you better
it makes no difference to me," said the doctor gruffly, picking up his
bag."Doctor, you will come back again to-morrow?"I can do no more--unless
you agree to amputation.There is no use coming back to-morrow.I can't give all my time to this Indian."The
contempt in the doctor's voice for a mere Indian stung her like a whip.On Mandy's cheek, pale with her long vigil, a red flush appeared and
in her eye a light that would have warned the doctor had he known her
better.But the doctor was very impatient and anxious to be gone.Yes, of course, a human being, but there are human
beings and human beings.But if you mean an Indian is as good as a white
man, frankly I don't agree with you.""You have given a great deal of your time, doctor," said Mandy with
quiet deliberation, "and I am most grateful.I can ask no more for THIS
INDIAN.I only regret that I have been forced to ask so much of your
time.There was a ring as of steel in her voice.The doctor
became at once apologetic."What--eh?--I beg your pardon," he stammered.I don't quite--"

"Good-by, doctor, and again thank you.""Well, you know quite well I can't do any more," said the old doctor
crossly."No, I don't think you can."And awkwardly the doctor walked away,
rather uncertain as to her meaning but with a feeling that he had been
dismissed.he muttered as he left the tent door,
indignant with himself that no fitting reply would come to his lips.And
not until he had mounted his horse and taken the trail was he able to
give full and adequate expression to his feelings, and even then it
took him some considerable time to do full justice to himself and to the
situation.Meantime the nurse had turned back to her watch, weary and despairing.In a way that she could not herself understand the Indian boy had
awakened her interest and even her affection.His fine stoical courage,
his warm and impulsive gratitude excited her admiration and touched her
heart.Again arose to her lips a cry that had been like a refrain in her
heart for the past three days, "Oh, if only Dr.Martin had made it only too apparent
that the old army surgeon was archaic in his practice and method.she said aloud, as she bent over her
patient.As if in answer to her cry there was outside a sound of galloping
horses.She ran to the tent door and before her astonished eyes there
drew up at her tent Dr.Martin, her sister-in-law and the ever-faithful
Smith.she cried, running to him with both hands
outstretched, and could say no more.Say, what the deuce have they been doing to you?""Oh, I am glad, that's all."Well, you show your joy in a mighty queer way.""She's done out, Doctor," cried Moira, springing from her horse and
running to her sister-in-law."I ought to have come before to relieve
her," she continued penitently, with her arms round Mandy, "but I knew
so little, and besides I thought the doctor was here.""He was here," said Mandy, recovering herself."He has just gone, and
oh, I am glad.How did you get here in all the world?""Your telegram came when I was away," said the doctor."I did not get it
for a day, then I came at once."I have it here--no, I've left it somewhere--but I
certainly got a telegram from you."Martin's presence, and--I ventured to send a wire in your name.I hope
you will forgive the liberty," said Smith, red to his hair-roots and
looking over his horse's neck with a most apologetic air.Smith, you are
my guardian angel," running to him and shaking him warmly by the hand."And he brought, us here, too," cried Moira."He has been awfully good
to me these days.I do not know what I should have done without him."Meantime Smith was standing first on one foot and then on the other in a
most unhappy state of mind."Guess I will be going back," he said in an agony of awkwardness and
confusion."I've got some chores to look after, and I guess none of you are coming
back now anyway.""Well, hold on a bit," said the doctor."Guess you don't need me any more," continued Smith.And he
climbed on to his horse.No one appeared to have any good reason why Smith should remain, and so
he rode away."You have really
saved my life, I assure you.Smith," cried Moira, waving her hand with a bright smile."You have saved me too from dying many a time these three days."With an awkward wave Smith answered these farewells and rode down the
trail."He is really a fine fellow," said Mandy."That is just it," cried Moira."He has spent his whole time these three
days doing things for me.""Ah, no wonder," said the doctor.But what's the
trouble here?Mandy gave him a detailed history of the case, the doctor meanwhile
making an examination of the patient's general condition."And the doctor would have his foot off, but I would not stand for
that," cried Mandy indignantly as she closed her history.Looks bad enough to come off, I should say.I wish I had been here
a couple of days ago."I don't know what the outcome may be, but it
looks as bad as it well can.""Oh, that's all right," cried Mandy cheerfully."I knew it would be all
right.""Well, whether it will or not I cannot say.But one thing I do know,
you've got to trot off to sleep.Show me the ropes and then off you go."Oh, the Chief does, Chief Trotting Wolf.And she ran from the tent
to find the Chief.But she is played right out I can see,"
replied the doctor."I must get comfortable quarters for you both."echoed the doctor, looking at her as she stood in the
glow of the westering sun shining through the canvas tent."Well, you can just bet that
is just what I do want."A slight flush appeared on the girl's face."I mean," she said hurriedly, "cannot I be of some help?""Most certainly, most certainly," said the doctor, noting the flush."Your help will be invaluable after a bit.She has been on this job, I understand, for three
days.I am quite ready to take my
sister-in-law's place, that is, as far as I can.And you will surely
need some one--to help you I mean."The doctor's eyes were upon her
face.The glow of the sunset through
the tent walls illumined her face with a wonderful radiance."Miss Moira," said the doctor with abrupt vehemence, "I wish I had the
nerve to tell you just how much--"

"Hush!"cried the girl, her glowing face suddenly pale, "they are
coming."Martin," cried Mandy, ushering in that stately
individual.The doctor saluted the Chief in due form and said:

"Could we have another tent, Chief, for these ladies?Just beside this
tent here, so that they can have a little sleep."The Chief grunted a doubtful acquiescence, but in due time a tent very
much dilapidated was pitched upon the clean dry ground close beside
that in which the sick boy lay.While this was being done the doctor was
making a further examination of his patient.With admiring eyes,
Moira followed the swift movements of his deft fingers.There was the sure indication
of accurate knowledge, the obvious self-confidence of experience in
everything he did.Even to her untutored eyes the doctor seemed to be
walking with a very firm tread.At length, after an hour's work, he turned to Mandy who was assisting
him and said:

"Now you can both go to sleep."You will be sure to call me if I can be of service," said Mandy.I shall look after
this end of the job.""He is very sure of himself, is he not?"said Moira in a low tone to her
sister-in-law as they passed out of the tent."He has a right to be," said Mandy proudly."He knows his work, and now
I feel as if I can sleep in peace.What a blessed thing sleep is," she
added, as, without undressing, she tumbled on to the couch prepared for
her.Well, rather--" Her voice was trailing off again into slumber.Knows his work if that's what you mean.Oh-h--but I'm
sleepy."That
is, he is a man all through right to his toe-tips.And gentle--more
gentle than any woman I ever saw.And before
Moira could make reply she was sound asleep.Before the night was over the opportunity was given the doctor to
prove his manhood, and in a truly spectacular manner.For shortly
after midnight Moira found herself sitting bolt upright, wide-awake and
clutching her sister-in-law in wild terror.Outside their tent the night
was hideous with discordant noises, yells, whoops, cries, mingled with
the beating of tom-toms.Terrified and trembling, the two girls sprang
to the door, and, lifting the flap, peered out.It was the party of
braves returning from the great powwow so rudely interrupted by Cameron.They were returning in an evil mood, too, for they were enraged at the
arrest of Eagle Feather and three accomplices in his crime, disappointed
in the interruption of their sun dance and its attendant joys of feast
and song, and furious at what appeared to them to be the overthrow of
the great adventure for which they had been preparing and planning for
the past two months.This was indeed the chief cause of their rage, for
it seemed as if all further attempts at united effort among the Western
tribes had been frustrated by the discovery of their plans, by the
flight of their leader, and by the treachery of the Blackfeet Chief,
Running Stream, in surrendering their fellow-tribesmen to the Police.To them that treachery rendered impossible any coalition between the
Piegans and the Blackfeet.Furthermore, before their powwow had been
broken up there had been distributed among them a few bottles of
whisky provided beforehand by the astute Sioux as a stimulus to their
enthusiasm against a moment of crisis when such stimulus should be
necessary.These bottles, in the absence of their great leader, were
distributed among the tribes by Running Stream as a peace-offering, but
for obvious reason not until the moment came for their parting from each
other.Filled with rage and disappointment, and maddened with the bad whisky
they had taken, they poured into the encampment with wild shouting
accompanied by the discharge of guns and the beating of drums.In terror
the girls clung to each other, gazing out upon the horrid scene.But her sister-in-law could give her little explanation.The moonlight,
glowing bright as day, revealed a truly terrifying spectacle.A band
of Indians, almost naked and hideously painted, were leaping, shouting,
beating drums and firing guns.Out from the tents poured the rest of the
band to meet them, eagerly inquiring into the cause of their excitement.Soon fires were lighted and kettles put on, for the Indian's happiness
is never complete unless associated with feasting, and the whole band
prepared itself for a time of revelry.As the girls stood peering out upon this terrible scene they became
aware of the doctor standing at their side."Say, they seem to be cutting up rather rough, don't they?""I think as a precautionary measure you had better step over
into the other tent."Hastily gathering their belongings, they ran across with the doctor to
his tent, from which they continued to gaze upon the weird spectacle
before them.About the largest fire in the center of the camp the crowd gathered,
Chief Trotting Wolf in the midst, and were harangued by one of
the returning braves who was evidently reciting the story of their
experiences and whose tale was received with the deepest interest and
was punctuated by mad cries and whoops.The one English word that could
be heard was the word "Police," and it needed no interpreter to
explain to the watchers that the chief object of fury to the crowding,
gesticulating Indians about the fire was the Policeman who had been the
cause of their humiliation and disappointment.In a pause of the uproar
a loud exclamation from an Indian arrested the attention of the band.Once more he uttered his exclamation and pointed to the tent lately
occupied by the ladies.Quickly the whole band about the fire appeared
to bunch together preparatory to rush in the direction indicated, but
before they could spring forward Trotting Wolf, speaking rapidly and
with violent gesticulation, stood in their path.He was thrust aside and the whole band came rushing madly
toward the tent lately occupied by the ladies."Get back from the door," said the doctor, speaking rapidly."These
chaps seem to be somewhat excited.I wish I had my gun," he continued,
looking about the tent for a weapon of some sort."This will do," he
said, picking up a stout poplar pole that had been used for driving the
tent pegs."But they will kill you," cried Moira, laying her hand upon his arm.I'll
knock some of their blocks off first."So saying, he lifted the flap of
the tent and passed out just as the rush of maddened Indians came.Upon the ladies' tent they fell, kicked the tent poles down, and,
seizing the canvas ripped it clear from its pegs.Some moments they
spent searching the empty bed, then turned with renewed cries toward the
other tent before which stood the doctor, waiting, grim, silent, savage.For a single moment they paused, arrested by the silent figure, then
with a whoop a drink-maddened brave sprang toward the tent, his rifle
clubbed to strike.Before he could deliver his blow the doctor, stepping
swiftly to one side, swung his poplar club hard upon the uplifted arms,
sent the rifle crashing to the ground and with a backward swing caught
the astonished brave on the exposed head and dropped him to the earth as
if dead.he
shouted, swinging his club as a player might a baseball bat.Before the next rush, however, help came in an unexpected form.The tent
flap was pushed back and at the doctor's side stood an apparition that
checked the Indians' advance and stilled their cries.It was the Indian
boy, clad in a white night robe of Mandy's providing, his rifle in his
hand, his face ghastly in the moonlight and his eyes burning like flames
of light.One cry he uttered, weird, fierce, unearthly, but it seemed
to pierce like a knife through the stillness that had fallen.Awed,
sobered, paralyzed, the Indians stood motionless.Then from their ranks
ran Chief Trotting Wolf, picked up the rifle of the Indian who still lay
insensible on the ground, and took his place beside the boy.A few words he spoke in a voice that rang out fiercely imperious.Again the Chief spoke in short, sharp
words of command, and, as they still hesitated, took one swift stride
toward the man that stood nearest, swinging his rifle over his head.Forward sprang the doctor to his side, his poplar club likewise swung up
to strike.Back fell the Indians a pace or two, the Chief following them
with a torrential flow of vehement invective.Slowly, sullenly the crowd
gave back, cowed but still wrathful, and beginning to mutter in angry
undertones.Once more the tent flap was pushed aside and there issued
two figures who ran to the side of the Indian boy, now swaying weakly
upon his rifle.cried Mandy, throwing her arms round about him, and,
steadying him as he let his rifle fall, let him sink slowly to the
ground.cried Moira, seizing the rifle that the boy had dropped
and springing to the doctor's side.She
turned and pointed indignantly to the swooning boy.With an exclamation of wrath the doctor stepped back to Mandy's aid,
forgetful of the threatening Indians and mindful only of his patient.Quickly he sprang into the tent, returning with a stimulating remedy,
bent over the boy and worked with him till he came back again to life.Once more the Chief, who with the Indians had been gazing upon this
scene, turned and spoke to his band, this time in tones of quiet
dignity, pointing to the little group behind him.Silent and subdued the
Indians listened, their quick impulses like those of children stirred
to sympathy for the lad and for those who would aid him.Gradually the
crowd drew off, separating into groups and gathering about the various
fires.Martin and the Chief carried the boy into the tent and
laid him on his bed."What sort of beasts have you got out there anyway?"said the doctor,
facing the Chief abruptly."Him drink bad whisky," answered the Chief, tipping up his hand."Him
crazee," touching his head with his forefinger.What they want is a few ounces of lead."The Chief made no reply, but stood with his eyes turned admiringly upon
Moira's face."Squaw--him good," he said, pointing to the girl."No 'fraid--much
brave--good.""You are right enough there, Chief," replied the doctor heartily.inquired the Chief, pointing to Moira.No, not exactly," replied the doctor, much confused, "that
is--not yet I mean--"

"Huh!Him good man," replied the Chief, pointing first
to Moira, then to the doctor.replied the Chief, moving out past her."Him drink, him
crazee--no drink, no crazee."At the door he paused, and, looking back,
said once more with increased emphasis, "Huh!Him good squaw," and
finally disappeared."The old boy is a
man of some discernment I can see.But the kid and you saved the day,
Miss Moira."It was truly awful, and how
splendidly you--you--"

"Well, I caught him rather a neat one, I confess.I wonder if the brute
is sleeping yet.But you did the trick finally, Miss Moira.""Huh," grunted Mandy derisively, "Good man--good squaw, eh?"CHAPTER XV

THE OUTLAW


The bitter weather following an autumn of unusual mildness had set in
with the New Year and had continued without a break for fifteen days.A
heavy fall of snow with a blizzard blowing sixty miles an hour had made
the trails almost impassable, indeed quite so to any but to those bent
on desperate business or to Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police.To
these gallant riders all trails stood open at all seasons of the year,
no matter what snow might fall or blizzard blow, so long as duty called
them forth.The trail from the fort to the Big Horn Ranch, however, was so
wind-swept that the snow was blown away, which made the going fairly
easy, and the Superintendent, Inspector Dickson and Jerry trotted along
freely enough in the face of a keen southwester that cut to the bone.It was surely some desperate business indeed that sent them out into
the face of that cutting wind which made even these hardy riders, burned
hard and dry by scorching suns and biting blizzards, wince and shelter
their faces with their gauntleted hands."It is the raw southwester that gets to the bone," replied Inspector
Dickson."This will blow up a chinook before night.""I wonder if he has got into shelter," said the Superintendent."This
has been an unusually hard fortnight, and I am afraid he went rather
light.""Oh, he's sure to be all right," replied the Inspector quickly."He was
riding, but he took his snowshoes with him for timber work.He's hardly
the man to get caught and he won't quit easily.""No, he won't quit, but there are times when human endurance fails.Not
that I fear anything like that for Cameron," added the Superintendent
hastily."Oh, he's not the man to fall down," replied the Inspector."He goes the
limit, but he keeps his head."Well, you ought to know him," said the Superintendent."You have been
through some things together, but this last week has been about the
worst that I have known.This fortnight will be remembered in the annals
of this country.What do you think about
it, Jerry?"continued the Superintendent, turning to the half-breed."He good man--cold ver' bad--ver' long.S'pose catch heem on
plains--ver' bad."The Inspector touched his horse to a canter.The vision that floated
before his mind's eye while the half-breed was speaking he hated to
contemplate.He has come through too many tight places to fail
here," said the Inspector in a tone almost of defiance, and refused to
talk further upon the subject.But he kept urging the pace till they
drew up at the stables of the Big Horn Ranch.The Inspector's first glance upon opening the stable door swept the
stall where Ginger was wont to conduct his melancholy ruminations.It
gave him a start to see the stall empty.he cried as that individual appeared with a bundle of
hay from the stack in the yard outside.inquired the Superintendent in the same
breath, and in spite of himself a note of anxiety had crept into his
voice.The three men stood waiting, their tense attitude expressing the
anxiety they would not put into words.The deliberate Smith, who had
transferred his services from old Thatcher to Cameron and who had taken
the ranch and all persons and things belonging to it into his immediate
charge, disposed of his bundle in a stall, and then facing them said
slowly:

"Guess he's all right."Gone to bed, I think," answered Smith with
maddening calmness.The Inspector cursed him between his teeth and turned away from the
others till his eyes should be clear again.Cameron for a few minutes," said the
Superintendent.Leaving Jerry to put up their horses, they went into the ranch-house and
found the ladies in a state of suppressed excitement.Mandy met them at
the door with an eager welcome, holding out to them trembling hands."Oh, I am so glad you have come!""It was all I could do
to hold him back from going to you even as he was.He was quite set on
going and only lay down on promise that I should wake him in an hour.An hour, mind you," she continued, talking
rapidly and under obvious excitement, "and him so blind and exhausted
that--" She paused abruptly, unable to command her voice."He ought to sleep twelve hours straight," said the Superintendent with
emphasis, "and twenty-four would be better, with suitable breaks for
refreshment," he added in a lighter tone, glancing at Mandy's face."Yes, indeed," she replied, "for he has had little enough to eat the
last three days.And that reminds me--" she hurried to the pantry and
returned with the teapot--"you must be cold, Superintendent.A hot cup of tea will be just the thing.It will take
only five minutes--and it is better than punch, though perhaps you men
do not think so."Cameron," said the Superintendent in a shocked, bantering
voice, "how can you imagine we should be guilty of such heresy--in this
prohibition country, too?""Oh, I know you men," replied Mandy."We keep some Scotch in the
house--beside the laudanum.Some people can't take tea, you know," she
added with an uncertain smile, struggling to regain control of herself."But all the same, I am a nurse, and I know that after exposure tea is
better.""Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I bow to your experience,"
making a brave attempt to meet her mood and declining to note her
unusual excitement.In the specified five minutes the tea was ready."I could quite accept your tea-drinking theory, Mrs.Cameron," said
Inspector Dickson, "if--if, mark you--I should always get such tea as
this.But I don't believe Jerry here would agree."Jerry, who had just entered, stood waiting explanation.Cameron has just been upholding the virtue of a good cup of tea,
Jerry, over a hot Scotch after a cold ride.A slight grin wrinkled the cracks in Jerry's leather-skin face."Hot whisky--good for fun--for cold no good.Whisky good for sleep--for
long trail no good.""Thank you, Jerry," cried Mandy enthusiastically."Oh, that's all right, Jerry," said the Inspector, joining in the
general laugh that followed, "but I don't think Miss Moira here would
agree with you in regard to the merits of her national beverage.""Oh, I am not so sure," cried the young lady, entering into the mood
of the others."Of course, I am Scotch and naturally stand up for my
country and for its customs, but, to be strictly honest, I remember
hearing my brother say that Scotch was bad training for football.""You see, when anything serious is on, the
wisest people cut out the Scotch, as the boys say."Cameron," said the Superintendent, becoming
grave."On the long trail and in the bitter cold we drop the Scotch and
bank on tea.As for whisky, the Lord knows it gives the Police enough
trouble in this country.If it were not for the whisky half our work
would be cut out.he added, as he
handed back his cup for another supply of tea."Done up, or more nearly done up than ever I have seen him, or than I
ever want to see him again."Mandy paused abruptly, handed him his
cup of tea, passed into the pantry and for some moments did not appear
again."Oh, it was terrible to see him," said Moira, clasping her hands and
speaking in an eager, excited voice."He came, poor boy, stumbling
toward the door.He had to leave his horse, you know, some miles away.Through the window we saw him coming along--and we did not know him--he
staggered as if--as if--actually as if he were drunk.""And he could not find the latch--and when we opened
the door his eyes were--oh!--so terrible!--wild--and bloodshot--and
blind!she exclaimed, her voice
breaking and her tears falling fast.We had to cut off his snow-shoes--and his gauntlets and his clothes
were like iron.He could not sit down--he just--just--lay on the
floor--till--my sister--" Here the girl's sobs interrupted her story.The Inspector had risen and came round to Moira's side."Don't try to tell me any more," he said in a husky voice, patting her
gently on the shoulder."He is here with us, safe, poor chap.he cried in an undertone, "what he must have gone through!"At this point Mandy returned and took her place again quietly by the
fire."It was this sudden spell of cold that nearly killed him," she said in a
quiet voice."He was not fully prepared for it, and it caught him at
the end of his trip, too, when he was nearly played out.You see, he was
five weeks away and he had only expected to be three.""I don't know what it was," replied Mandy."He could tell me little, but
he was determined to go on to the fort.""I know something about his plans," said the Inspector."He had proposed
a tour of the reserves, beginning with the Piegans and ending with the
Bloods.""And we know something of his work, too, Mrs."Superintendent Strong has sent us a very fine report
indeed of your husband's work.We do not talk about these things,
you know, in the Police, but we can appreciate them all the same.Superintendent Strong's letter is one you would like to keep.Knowing Superintendent Strong as I do--"

"I know him too," said Mandy with a little laugh."Well, then, you will be able to appreciate all the more any word of
commendation he would utter.He practically attributes the present state
of quiet and the apparent collapse of this conspiracy business to
your husband's efforts.This, of course, is no compensation for his
sufferings or yours, but I think it right that you should know the
facts."The Superintendent had risen to his feet and had delivered his
little speech in his very finest manner."We had expected him back a week ago," said the Inspector."We know he
must have had some serious cause for delay.""I do not know about that," replied Mandy, "but I do know he was most
anxious to go on to the fort.He had some information to give, he said,
which was of the first importance.He will
be saved that trip, which would really be dangerous in his present
condition.And I don't believe I could have stopped him, but I should
have gone with him."Don't think of waking him," said the Superintendent."We can wait two
hours, or three hours, or more if necessary."He would waken himself if he were not so fearfully done up.He has a
trick of waking at any hour he sets," said Mandy.A few minutes later Cameron justified her remarks by appearing from
the inner room.The men, accustomed as they were to the ravages of
the winter trail upon their comrades, started to their feet in horror.Blindly Cameron felt his way to them, shading his blood-shot eyes from
the light.His face was blistered and peeled as if he had come through a
fire, his lips swollen and distorted, his hands trembling and showing
on every finger the marks of frost bite, and his feet dragging as he
shuffled across the floor."My dear fellow, my dear fellow," cried the Inspector, springing up to
meet him and grasping him by both arms to lead him to a chair."You ran
it too close that time.Sit
down, old man, sit down right here."The Inspector deposited him in the
chair, and, striding hurriedly to the window, stood there looking out
upon the bleak winter snow."Hello, Cameron," said the Superintendent, shaking him by the hand with
hearty cheerfulness."Glad, awfully glad to see you.Fine bit of work,
very fine bit of work."I don't know what you refer to, sir," said Cameron, speaking thickly,
"but I am glad you are here, for I have an important communication to
make.""Oh, that's all right," said the Superintendent.Snow-blind, I see," he continued, critically examining him, "and
generally used up.""Rather knocked up," replied Cameron, his tongue refusing to move with
its accustomed ease."But shall be fit in a day or two.Beastly sleepy,
but cannot sleep somehow.Shall feel better when my mind is at rest."Superintendent Strong has sent us in a report, and a very creditable
report, too.""Well, the thing I want to say is
that though all looks quiet--there is less horse stealing this month,
and less moving about from the reserves--yet I believe a serious
outbreak is impending."The Inspector, who had come around and taken a seat beside him, touched
his knee at this point with an admonishing pressure.You
need not have any fear about them."A little smile distorted his face as
he laid his hand upon his wife's shoulder.He was as a man feeling his way through a maze."Oh, let it go," said the Inspector."Wait till you have had some
sleep.""No, I must--I must get this out.Well, anyway, the principal thing
is that Big Bear, Beardy, Poundmaker--though I am not sure about
Poundmaker--have runners on every reserve and they are arranging for
a big meeting in the spring, to which every tribe North and West is to
send representatives.That Frenchman--what's his name?--I'll forget my
own next--"

"Riel?"That Frenchman is planning a big coup in the spring.You
know they presented him with a house the other day, ready furnished, at
Batoche, to keep him in the country.Oh, the half-breeds are very keen
on this.And what is worse, I believe a lot of whites are in with them
too.A chap named Jackson, and another named Scott, and Isbister and
some others.These names are spoken of on every one of our reserves.I tell you, sir," he said, turning his blind eyes toward the
Superintendent, "I consider it very serious indeed.And worst of all,
the biggest villain of the lot, Little Pine, Cree Chief you know, our
bitterest enemy--except Little Thunder, who fortunately is cleared out
of the country--you remember, sir, that chap Raven saw about that.""Well--where was I?--Oh, yes, Little Pine, the biggest villain of them
all, is somewhere about here.I got word of him when I was at the
Blood Reserve on my way home some ten days ago.I heard he was with
the Blackfeet, but I found no sign of him there.But he is in the
neighborhood, and he is specially bound to see old Crowfoot.I
understand he is a particularly successful pleader, and unusually
cunning, and I am afraid of Crowfoot.He was very
cordial and is apparently loyal enough as yet, but you know, sir, how
much that may mean.I think that is all," said Cameron, putting his hand
up to his head."I have a great deal more to tell you, but it will not
come back to me now.Little Pine must be attended to, and for a day or
two I am sorry I am hardly fit--awfully sorry."His voice sank into a
kind of undertone.cried the Superintendent, deeply stirred at the sight of
his obvious collapse.You have
nothing to be sorry for, but everything to be proud of.You have done a
great service to your country, and we will not forget it.In a few days
you will be fit and we shall show our gratitude by calling upon you to
do something more.A horseman had ridden past the
window toward the stables.I would know his splendid horse
anywhere."said the Superintendent, a hard look
upon his face.But the laws of hospitality are nowhere so imperative as on the western
plains.Cameron rose from his chair muttering, "Must look after his
horse.""You sit down," said Mandy firmly."Here, Jerry, go and show him where
to get things, and--" He hesitated."Bring him in," cried Mandy heartily.The men stood silent, looking at
Cameron."Certainly, bring him in," he said firmly, "a day like this," he added,
as if in apology."Why, of course," cried Mandy, looking from one to the other in
surprise.replied Moira, her cheeks burning and her
eyes flashing."You remember," she cried, addressing the Inspector, "how
he saved my life the day I arrived at this ranch.""Oh, yes," replied the Inspector briefly, "I believe I did hear that.""Well, I think he is splendid," repeated Moira."Eh?--well--I can't say I know him very well.""Ah, yes, a most beautiful animal, quite remarkable horse, splendid
horse; in fact one of the finest, if not the very finest, in this whole
country.And that is saying a good deal, too, Miss Moira.You see, this
country breeds good horses."And the Inspector went on to discourse in
full detail and with elaborate illustration upon the various breeds of
horses the country could produce, and to classify the wonderful black
stallion ridden by Raven, and all with such diligence and enthusiasm
that no other of the party had an opportunity to take part in the
conversation till Raven, in the convoy of Jerry, was seen approaching
the house.Cameron, I fear we must take our departure.These are rather
crowded days with us."We can hardly allow
that, you know.Cameron wants to have a great deal more
talk with you."The Superintendent attempted to set forth various other reasons for a
hasty departure, but they all seemed to lack sincerity, and after a few
more ineffective trials he surrendered and sat down again in silence.The next moment the door opened and Raven, followed by Jerry, stepped
into the room.As his eye fell upon the Superintendent, instinctively he
dropped his hands to his hips and made an involuntary movement backward,
but only for an instant.Immediately he came forward and greeted Mandy
with fine, old-fashioned courtesy."So delighted to meet you again, Mrs.Cameron, and also to meet your
charming sister."He shook hands with both the ladies very warmly."Ah, Superintendent," he continued, "delighted to see you.And you,
Inspector," he said, giving them a nod as he laid off his outer leather
riding coat."Hope I see you flourishing," he continued.His debonair
manner had in it a quizzical touch of humor."Ah, Cameron, home again I
see.The men, who had risen to their feet upon his entrance, stood regarding
him stiffly and made no other sign of recognition than a curt nod and a
single word of greeting."You have had quite a trip," he continued, addressing himself to
Cameron, and taking the chair offered by Mandy."I followed you part
way, but you travel too fast for me.Much too strenuous work I found
it.Why," he continued, looking narrowly at Cameron, "you are badly
punished.Raven," said Mandy quickly, for her husband sat
gazing stupidly into the fire."Do you mean to say
that you have been traveling these last three days?""Why, my dear sir, not even the Indians face such cold.Only the Mounted
Police venture out in weather like this--and those who want to get away
from them.His gay, careless laugh rang
out in the most cheery fashion.Mandy could not understand their grim and gloomy silence.By her
cordiality she sought to cover up and atone for the studied and almost
insulting indifference of her husband and her other guests.In these
attempts she was loyally supported by her sister-in-law, whose anger was
roused by the all too obvious efforts on the part of her brother and
his friends to ignore this stranger, if not to treat him with contempt.There was nothing in Raven's manner to indicate that he observed
anything amiss in the bearing of the male members of the company about
the fire.He met the attempt of the ladies at conversation with a
brilliancy of effort that quite captivated them, and, in spite of
themselves, drew the Superintendent and the Inspector into the flow of
talk.As the hour of the midday meal approached Mandy rose from her place by
the fire and said:

"You will stay with us to dinner, Mr.It is
not often we have such a distinguished and interesting company.""I merely looked in to give your husband
a bit of interesting information.And, by the way, I have a bit of
information that might interest the Superintendent as well.""Well," said Mandy, "we are to have the pleasure of the Superintendent
and the Inspector to dinner with us to-day, and you can give them all
the information you think necessary while you are waiting."Raven hesitated while he glanced at the faces of the men beside him.What he read there drew from him a little hard smile of amused contempt."Please do not ask me again, Mrs."You know not how
you strain my powers of resistance when I really dare not--may not," he
corrected himself with a quick glance at the Superintendent, "stay in
this most interesting company and enjoy your most grateful hospitality
any longer.First of all for you,
Cameron--I shall not apologize to you, Mrs.Cameron, for delivering
it in your presence.I do you the honor to believe that you ought to
know--briefly my information is this.Little Pine, in whose movements
you are all interested, I understand, is at this present moment lodging
with the Sarcee Indians, and next week will move on to visit old
Crowfoot.The Sarcee visit amounts to little, but the visit to old
Crowfoot--well, I need say no more to you, Cameron.Probably you know
more about the inside workings of old Crowfoot's mind than I do.""That is his present intention, and I have no doubt the program will
be carried out," said Raven.Of
course," he continued, "I know you have run across the trail of the
North Cree and Salteaux runners from Big Bear and Beardy.But Little Pine is a different person from these
gentlemen.The big game is scheduled for the early spring, will probably
come off in about six weeks.And now," he said, rising from his chair,
"I must be off."At this point Smith came in and quietly took a seat beside Jerry near
the door."And what's your information for me, Mr."You are not going to deprive me of my bit of news?""Ah, yes--news," replied Raven, sitting down again.Little Thunder has yielded to some powerful pressure and has again
found it necessary to visit this country, I need hardly add, against my
desire."exclaimed the Superintendent, and his tone indicated
something more than surprise.And where does this--ah--this--ah--friend of yours propose to locate
himself?""This friend of mine," replied Raven, with a hard gleam in his eye and
a bitter smile curling his lips, "who would gladly adorn his person with
my scalp if he might, will not ask my opinion as to his location, and
probably not yours either, Mr.As Raven ceased speaking
he once more rose from his chair, put on his leather riding coat and
took up his cap and gauntlets.Cameron," he said,
offering her his hand."Believe me, it has been a rare treat to see you
and to sit by your fireside for one brief half-hour."Raven, you are not to think of leaving us before dinner."The trail I take," said Raven in a grave voice, "is full of pitfalls
and I must take it when I can.But his smile awoke no response in the Superintendent, who sat rigidly
silent."It's a mighty cold day outside," interjected Smith, "and blowing up
something I think."blurted out Cameron, who sat stupidly gazing into
the fire, "Stay and eat.This is no kind of day to go out hungry."Thanks, Cameron, it IS a cold day, too cold to stay."He turned swiftly and looked into her soft brown eyes now filled with
warm kindly light."Alas, Miss Cameron," he replied in a low voice, turning his back upon
the others, his voice and his attitude seeming to isolate the girl from
the rest of the company, "believe me, if I do not stay it is not because
I do not want to, but because I cannot."echoed Moira in an equally low tone.Then, raising his voice, "Ask the
Superintendent.said Moira, turning upon the Superintendent, "What does
he mean?""If he cannot remain here
he knows why without appealing to me.""Ah, my dear Superintendent, how unfeeling!You hardly do yourself
justice," said Raven, proceeding to draw on his gloves.His drawling
voice seemed to irritate the Superintendent beyond control."Justice is a word you should hesitate
to use.""You see, Miss Cameron," said Raven with an injured air, "why I cannot
remain.""I do not see," she
repeated, "and if the Superintendent does I think he should explain."It wakened her brother as if from a
daze."Do not interfere where you do not
understand.""Then why make insinuations that cannot be explained?"cried his sister,
standing up very straight and looking the Superintendent fair in the
face.John went to the hallway.echoed the Superintendent in a cool, almost contemptuous,
voice."There are certain things best not explained, but believe me if
Mr.Quickly Moira turned to Raven with a
gesture of appeal and a look of loyal confidence in her eyes.For a
moment the hard, cynical face was illumined with a smile of rare beauty,
but only for a moment.The gleam passed and the old, hard, cynical face
turned in challenge to the Superintendent.breathed Moira, a thrill of triumphant relief in her voice, "he
cannot explain."cried the little half-breed, quivering with rage.What for he can no h'explain?Dem horse he steal de
night-tam'--dat whiskee he trade on de Indian.He no good--he one
beeg tief.Me--I put him one sure place he no steal no more!"A few moments of tense silence held the group rigid.In the center stood
Raven, his face pale, hard, but smiling, before him Moira, waiting,
eager, with lips parted and eyes aglow with successive passions,
indignation, doubt, fear, horror, grief.Again that swift and subtle
change touched Raven's face as his eyes rested upon the face of the girl
before him."Now you know why I cannot stay," he said gently, almost sadly."It is not true," murmured Moira, piteous appeal in voice and eyes.A
spasm crossed the pale face upon which her eyes rested, then the old
cynical look returned.Cameron," he said with a bow to Mandy, "for
a happy half-hour by your fireside, and farewell.""Good-by," said Mandy sadly."Oh, good-by, good-by," cried the girl impulsively, reaching out her
hand."I shall not forget that you were kind to
me."He bent low before her, but did not touch her outstretched hand.As
he turned toward the door Jerry slipped in before him.he cried excitedly, looking at the Superintendent; but
before the latter could answer a hand caught him by the coat collar
and with a swift jerk landed him on the floor.It was Smith, his face
furiously red.Before Jerry could recover himself Raven had opened the
door and passed out.said Mandy in a hushed, broken voice.Moira stood for a moment as if dazed, then suddenly turned to Smith and
said:

"Thank you.And Smith, red to his hair roots, murmured, "You wanted him to go?""Yes," said Moira, "I wanted him to go."CHAPTER XVI

WAR


Commissioner Irvine sat in his office at headquarters in the little town
of Regina, the capital of the North West Territories of the Dominion.A
number of telegrams lay before him on the table.A look of grave anxiety
was on his face.The cause of his anxiety was to be found in the news
contained in the telegrams.In a few moments Inspector Sanders made his appearance, a tall,
soldierlike man, trim in appearance, prompt in movement and somewhat
formal in speech."Well, the thing has come," said the Commissioner, handing Inspector
Sanders one of the telegrams before him.Inspector Sanders took the
wire, read it and stood very erect."Looks like it, sir," he replied."It is just eight months since I first warned the government that
trouble would come.Superintendent Crozier knows the situation
thoroughly and would not have sent this wire if outbreak were not
imminent.Then here is one from Superintendent Gagnon at Carlton.Inspector Sanders gravely read the second telegram."We ought to have five hundred men on the spot this minute," he said."I have asked that a hundred men be sent up at once," said the
Commissioner, "but I am doubtful if we can get the Government to agree.It seems almost impossible to make the authorities feel the gravity
of the situation.They cannot realize, for one thing, the enormous
distances that separate points that look comparatively near together
upon the map.""And yet," he
continued, "they have these maps before them, and the figures, but
somehow the facts do not impress them.Look at this vast area lying
between these four posts that form an almost perfect quadrilateral.Here is the north line running from Edmonton at the northwest corner
to Prince Albert at the northeast, nearly four hundred miles away;
then here is the south line running from Macleod at the southwest four
hundred and fifty miles to Regina at the southeast; while the sides of
this quadrilateral are nearly three hundred miles long.Thus the four
posts forming our quadrilateral are four hundred miles apart one way by
three hundred another, and, if we run the lines down to the boundary and
to the limit of the territory which we patrol, the disturbed area may
come to be about five hundred miles by six hundred; and we have some
five hundred men available.""It is a good thing we have established the new post at Carlton,"
suggested Inspector Sanders.It is true we have strengthened up that
district recently with two hundred men distributed between Battleford,
Prince Albert, Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton.But Carlton is naturally a
very weak post and is practically of little use to us.True, it guards
us against those Willow Crees and acts as a check upon old Beardy.""A troublesome man, that Kah-me-yes-too-waegs--old Beardy, I mean.It
took me some time to master that one," said Inspector Sanders, "but then
I have studied German.He always has been a nuisance," continued the
Inspector."He was a groucher when the treaty was made in '76 and he has
been a groucher ever since.""If we only had the men, just another five hundred," replied the
Commissioner, tapping the map before him with his finger, "we should
hold this country safe.But what with these restless half-breeds led by
this crack-brained Riel, and these ten thousand Indians--"

"Not to speak of a couple of thousand non-treaty Indians roaming the
country and stirring up trouble," interjected the Inspector."True enough," replied the Commissioner, "but I would have no fear
of the Indians were it not for these half-breeds.They have real
grievances, remember, Sanders, real grievances, and that gives force to
their quarrel and cohesion to the movement.Men who have a conviction
that they are suffering injustice are not easily turned aside.They ride hard and shoot straight and are afraid of
nothing.I confess frankly it looks very serious to me.""For my part," said Inspector Sanders, "it is the Indians I fear most."Really,
one wonders at the docility of the Indians, and their response to fair
and decent treatment.Twenty years ago, no,
fifteen years ago, less than fifteen years ago, these Indians whom we
have been holding in our hand so quietly were roaming these plains,
living like lords on the buffalo and fighting like fiends with each
other, free from all control.Little wonder if, now feeling the pinch of
famine, fretting under the monotony of pastoral life, and being
incited to war by the hot-blooded half-breeds, they should break out
in rebellion.Just this, a feeling
that they have been justly treated, fairly and justly dealt with by the
Government, and a wholesome respect for Her Majesty's North West Mounted
Police, if I do say it myself.But the thing is on, and we must be
ready.""Well, thank God, there is not much to be done in the way of
preparation," replied the Commissioner.For the past six months we have been on the alert for this emergency,
but we must strike promptly.When I think of these settlers about Prince
Albert and Battleford at the mercy of Beardy and that restless and
treacherous Salteaux, Big Bear, I confess to a terrible anxiety.""Then there is the West, sir, as well," said Sanders, "the Blackfeet and
the Bloods."So do I. It is a great matter
that Crowfoot is well disposed toward us, that he has confidence in our
officers and that he is a shrewd old party as well.But Crowfoot is an
Indian and the head of a great tribe with warlike traditions and with
ambitions, and he will find it difficult to maintain his own loyalty,
and much more that of his young men, in the face of any conspicuous
successes by his Indian rivals, the Crees.But," added the Commissioner,
rolling up the map, "I called you in principally to say that I wish you
to have every available man and gun ready for a march at a day's notice.Further, I wish you to wire Superintendent Herchmer at Calgary to
send at the earliest possible moment twenty-five men at least, fully
equipped.We shall need every man we can spare from every post in the
West to send North."They will be ready," said Inspector Sanders, and,
saluting, he left the room.Two days later, on the 18th of March, long before the break of day, the
Commissioner set out on his famous march to Prince Albert, nearly three
hundred miles away.They were but a small
company of ninety men, but every man was thoroughly fit for the part
he was expected to play in the momentous struggle before him; brave, of
course, trained in prompt initiative, skilled in plaincraft, inured to
hardship, oblivious of danger, quick of eye, sure of hand and rejoicing
in fight.Commissioner Irvine knew he could depend upon them to see
through to a finish, to their last ounce of strength and their last
blood-drop, any bit of work given them to do.Past Pie-a-pot's Reserve
and down the Qu'Appelle Valley to Misquopetong's, through the Touchwood
Hills and across the great Salt Plain, where he had word by wire from
Crozier of the first blow being struck at the south branch of the
Saskatchewan where some of Beardy's men gave promise of their future
conduct by looting a store, Irvine pressed his march.Onward along the
Saskatchewan, he avoided the trap laid by four hundred half-breeds at
Batoche's Crossing, and, making the crossing at Agnew's, further down,
arrived at Prince Albert all fit and sound on the eve of the 24th,
completing his two hundred and ninety-one miles in just seven days; and
that in the teeth of the bitter weather of a rejuvenated winter, without
loss of man or horse, a feat worthy of the traditions of the Force of
which he was the head, and of the Empire whose most northern frontier it
was his task to guard.Twenty-four hours to sharpen their horses' calks and tighten up their
cinches, and Irvine was on the trail again en route for Fort Carlton,
where he learned serious disturbances were threatening.Arrived at Fort
Carlton in the afternoon of the same day, the Commissioner found there a
company of men, sad, grim and gloomy.In the fort a dozen of the gallant
volunteers from Prince Albert and Crozier's Mounted Police lay groaning,
some of them dying, with wounds.Others lay with their faces covered,
quiet enough; while far down on the Duck Lake trail still others lay
with the white snow red about them.The story was told the Commissioner
with soldierlike brevity by Superintendent Crozier.The previous day a
storekeeper from Duck Lake, Mitchell by name, had ridden in to report
that his stock of provisions and ammunition was about to be seized by
the rebels.Immediately early next morning a Sergeant of the Police with
some seventeen constables had driven off to prevent these provisions and
ammunition falling into the hands of the enemy.At ten o'clock a scout
came pounding down the trail with the announcement that Sergeant Stewart
was in trouble and that a hundred rebels had disputed his advance.Hard upon the heels of the scout came the Sergeant himself with his
constables to tell their tale to a body of men whose wrath grew as
they listened.More and more furious waxed their rage as they heard
the constables tell of the threats and insults heaped upon them by the
half-breeds and Indians.The Prince Albert volunteers more especially
were filled with indignant rage.To think that half-breeds and
Indians--Indians, mark you!--whom they had been accustomed to regard
with contempt, should have dared to turn back upon the open trail a
company of men wearing the Queen's uniform!The Police officers received the news with philosophic calm.It was
merely an incident in the day's work to them.Sooner or later they would
bring these bullying half-breeds and yelling Indians to task for their
temerity.But the volunteers were undisciplined in the business of receiving
insults.The Superintendent
pointed out that the Commissioner was within touch bringing
reinforcements.It might be wise to delay matters a few hours till his
arrival.But meantime the provisions and ammunition would be looted
and distributed among the enemy, and that was a serious matter.The
impetuous spirit of the volunteers prevailed.Within an hour a hundred
men with a seven-pr.gun, eager to exact punishment for the insults
they had suffered, took the Duck Lake trail.Ambushed by a foe who,
regardless of the conventions of war, made treacherous use of the white
flag, overwhelmed by more than twice their number, hampered in their
evolutions by the deep crusted snow, the little company, after a
half-hour's sharp engagement with the strongly posted enemy, were forced
to retire, bearing their wounded and some of their dead with them,
leaving others of their dead lying in the snow behind them.And now the question was what was to be done?The events of the day
had taught them their lesson, a lesson that experience has taught all
soldiers, the lesson, namely, that it is never safe to despise a foe.A few miles away from them were between three hundred and four hundred
half-breeds and Indians who, having tasted blood, were eager for more.The fort at Carlton was almost impossible of defense.The whole South
country was in the hands of rebels.Companies of half-breeds breathing
blood and fire, bands of Indians, marauding and terrorizing, were
roaming the country, wrecking homesteads, looting stores, threatening
destruction to all loyal settlers and direst vengeance upon all who
should dare to oppose them.The situation called for quick thought and
quick action.Every hour added to the number of the enemy.Whole tribes
of Indians were wavering in their allegiance.Another victory such as
Duck Lake and they would swing to the side of the rebels.The strategic
center of the English settlements in all this country was undoubtedly
Prince Albert.Fort Carlton stood close to the border of the half-breed
section and was difficult of defense.After a short council of war it was decided to abandon Fort Carlton.Thereupon Irvine led his troops, together with the gallant survivors of
the bloody fight at Duck Lake, bearing their dead and wounded with
them, to Prince Albert, there to hold that post with its hundreds of
defenseless women and children gathered in from the country round about,
against hostile half-breeds without and treacherous half-breeds within
the stockade, and against swarming bands of Indians hungry for loot and
thirsting for blood.And there Irvine, chafing against inactivity, eager
for the joyous privilege of attack, spent the weary anxious days of the
next six weeks, held at his post by the orders of his superior officer
and by the stern necessities of the case, and meantime finding some
slight satisfaction in scouting and scouring the country for miles on
every side, thus preventing any massing of the enemy's forces.The affair at Duck Lake put an end to all parley.Riel had been
clamoring for "blood!At Duck Lake he received his first
taste, but before many days were over he was to find that for every drop
of blood that reddened the crusted snow at Duck Lake a thousand Canadian
voices would indignantly demand vengeance.The rifle-shots that rang out
that winter day from the bluffs that lined the Duck Lake trail echoed
throughout Canada from ocean to ocean, and everywhere men sprang to
offer themselves in defense of their country.But echoes of these
rifle-shots rang, too, in the teepees on the Western plains where the
Piegans, the Bloods and the Blackfeet lay crouching and listening.By some mysterious system of telegraphy known only to themselves old
Crowfoot and his braves heard them almost as soon as the Superintendent
at Fort Macleod.Instantly every teepee was pulsing with the fever of
war.The young braves dug up their rifles from their bedding, gathered
together their ammunition, sharpened their knives and tomahawks in eager
anticipation of the call that would set them on the war-path against the
white man who had robbed them of their ancient patrimony and who held
them in such close leash.The great day had come, the day they had been
dreaming of in their hearts, talking over at their council-fires and
singing about in their sun dances during the past year, the day promised
by the many runners from their brother Crees of the North, the day
foretold by the great Sioux orator and leader, Onawata.The war of
extermination had begun and the first blood had gone to the Indian and
to his brother half-breed.Two days after Duck Lake came the word that Fort Carlton had been
abandoned and Battleford sacked.Five days later the news of the bloody
massacre of Frog Lake cast over every English settlement the shadow of
a horrible fear.From the Crow's Nest to the Blackfoot Crossing bands of
braves broke loose from the reserves and began to "drive cattle" for the
making of pemmican in preparation for the coming campaign.It was a day of testing for all Canadians, but especially a day of
testing for the gallant little force of six or seven hundred riders who,
distributed in small groups over a vast area of over two hundred and
fifty thousand square miles, were entrusted with the responsibility of
guarding the lives and property of Her Majesty's subjects scattered in
lonely and distant settlements over these wide plains.For while the Ottawa authorities with
late but frantic haste were hustling their regiments from all parts of
Canada to the scene of war, the Mounted Police had gripped the situation
with a grip so stern that the Indian allies of the half-breed rebels
paused in their leap, took a second thought and decided to wait till
events should indicate the path of discretion.And, to the blood-lusting Riel, Irvine's swift thrust Northward to
Prince Albert suggested caution, while his resolute stand at that
distant fort drove hard down in the North country a post of Empire that
stuck fast and sure while all else seemed to be sliding to destruction.Inspector Dickens, too, another of that fearless band of Police
officers, holding with his heroic little company of twenty-two
constables Fort Pitt in the far North, stayed the panic consequent upon
the Frog Lake massacre and furnished food for serious thought to the
cunning Chief, Little Pine, and his four hundred and fifty Crees, as
well as to the sullen Salteaux, Big Bear, with his three hundred braves.And to the lasting credit of Inspector Dickens it stands that he brought
his little company of twenty-two safe through a hostile country
overrun with excited Indians and half-breeds to the post of Battleford,
ninety-eight miles away.At Battleford, also, after the sacking of the town, Inspector Morris
with two hundred constables behind his hastily-constructed barricade
kept guard over four hundred women and children and held at bay a horde
of savages yelling for loot and blood.Griesbach, in like manner, with his little handful, at Fort
Saskatchewan, held the trail to Edmonton, and materially helped to bar
the way against Big Bear and his marauding band.And similarly at other points the promptness, resource, wisdom and
dauntless resolution of the gallant officers of the Mounted Police
and of the men they commanded saved Western Canada from the complete
subversion of law and order in the whole Northern part of the
territories and from the unspeakable horrors of a general Indian
uprising.But while in the Northern and Eastern part of the Territories the Police
officers rendered such signal service in the face of open rebellion, it
was in the foothill country in the far West that perhaps even greater
service was rendered to Canada and the Empire in this time of peril by
the officers and men of the Mounted Police.It was due to the influence of such men as the Superintendents and
Inspectors of the Police in charge of the various posts throughout
the foothill country more than to anything else that the Chiefs of
the "great, warlike, intelligent and untractable tribes" of Blackfeet,
Blood, Piegan, Sarcee and Stony Indians were prevented from breaking
their treaties and joining with the rebel Crees, Salteaux and
Assiniboines of the North and East.For fifteen years the Chiefs of
these tribes had lived under the firm and just rule of the Police, had
been protected from the rapacity of unscrupulous traders and saved from
the ravages of whisky-runners.It was the proud boast of a Blood Chief
that the Police never broke a promise to the Indian and never failed to
exact justice either for his punishment or for his protection.Hence when the reserves were being overrun by emissaries from the
turbulent Crees and from the plotting half-breeds, in the face of the
impetuous demands of their own young men and of their minor Chiefs to
join in the Great Adventure, the great Chiefs, Red Crow and Rainy Chief
of the Bloods, Bull's Head of the Sarcees, Trotting Wolf of the Piegans,
and more than all, Crowfoot, the able, astute, wise old head of
the entire Blackfeet confederacy, held these young braves back from
rebellion and thus gave time and opportunity to Her Majesty's Forces
operating in the East and North to deal with the rebels.And during those days of strain, strain beyond the estimate of all
not immediately involved, it was the record of such men as the
Superintendents and Inspectors in charge at Fort Macleod, at Fort
Calgary and on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction
in the mountains, and their steady bearing that more than anything else
weighed with the great Chiefs and determined for them their attitude.For with calm, cool courage the Police patrols rode in and out of the
reserves, quietly reasoning with the big Chiefs, smiling indulgently
upon the turbulent minor Chiefs, checking up with swift, firm, but
tactful justice the many outbreaks against law and order, presenting
even in their most desperate moments such a front of resolute
self-confidence to the Indians, and refusing to give any sign by look
or word or act of the terrific anxiety they carried beneath their gay
scarlet coats.And the big Chiefs, reading the faces of these cool,
careless, resolute, smiling men who had a trick of appearing at
unexpected times in their camps and refused to be hurried or worried,
finally decided to wait a little longer.And they waited till the fatal
moment of danger was past and the time for striking--and in the heart
of every Chief of them the desire to strike for larger freedom and
independence lay deep--was gone.To these guardians of Empire who fought
no fight, who endured no siege, who witnessed no massacre, the Dominion
and the Empire owe more than none but the most observing will ever know.Paralleling these prompt measures of the North West Mounted Police, the
Government dispatched from both East and West of Canada regiments of
militia to relieve the beleaguered posts held by the Police, to prevent
the spread of rebellion and to hold the great tribes of the Indians of
the far West true to their allegiance.Already on the 27th of March, before Irvine had decided to abandon Fort
Carlton and to make his stand at Prince Albert, General Middleton had
passed through Winnipeg on his way to take command of the Canadian
Forces operating in the West; and before two weeks more had gone the
General was in command of a considerable body of troops at Qu'Appelle,
his temporary headquarters.From all parts of Canada these men gathered,
from Quebec and Montreal, from the midland counties of Ontario, from
the city of Toronto and from the city of Winnipeg, till some five or six
thousand citizen-soldiers were under arms.They were needed, too, every
man, not so much because of the possible weight of numbers of the enemy
opposing them, nor because of the tactical skill of those leading the
hostile forces, but because of the enemy's advantage of position, owing
to the nature of the country which formed the scene of the Rebellion,
and because of the character of the warfare adopted by their cunning
foe.The record of the brief six weeks' campaign constitutes a creditable
page in Canadian history, a page which no Canadian need blush to read
aloud in the presence of any company of men who know how to estimate at
their highest value those qualities of courage and endurance that are
the characteristics of the British soldier the world over.Superintendent Strong was in a pleasant mood, and the reason was not far
to seek.The distracting period of inaction, of doubt, of hesitation was
past, and now at last something would be done.His term of service along
the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction had been far from
congenial to him.There had been too much of the work of the ordinary
patrol-officer about it.True, he did his duty faithfully and
thoroughly, so faithfully, indeed, as to move the great men of the
railway company to outspoken praise, a somewhat unusual circumstance.But now he was called back to the work that more properly belonged to an
officer of Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police and his soul glowed
with the satisfaction of those who, having been found faithful in
uncongenial duty, are rewarded with an opportunity to do a bit of work
which they particularly delight to do.With his twenty-five men, whom for the past year he had been polishing
to a high state of efficiency in the trying work of police-duty in the
railway construction-camp, he arrived in Calgary on the evening of the
tenth of April, to find that post throbbing with military ardor and
thrilling with rumors of massacres and sieges, of marching columns and
contending forces.Small wonder that Superintendent Strong's face took
on an appearance of grim pleasure.Straight to the Police headquarters
he went, but there was no Superintendent there to welcome him.That
gentleman had gone East to meet the troops and was by now under
appointment as Chief of Staff to that dashing soldier, Colonel Otter.But meantime, though the Calgary Police Post was bare of men, there were
other men as keen and as daring, if not so thoroughly disciplined for
war, thronging the streets of the little town and asking only a leader
whom they could follow.It was late evening, but Calgary was an "all night" town, and every
minute was precious, for minutes might mean lives of women and children.So down the street rode Superintendent Strong toward the Royal Hotel.At
the hitching post of that hostelry a sad-looking broncho was tied, whose
calm, absorbed and detached appearance struck a note of discord with his
environment; for everywhere about him men and horses seemed to be in
a turmoil of excitement.Everywhere men in cow-boy garb were careering
about the streets or grouped in small crowds about the saloon doors.There were few loud voices, but the words of those who were doing the
speaking came more rapidly than usual.Such a group was gathered in the rear of the sad-looking broncho before
the door of the Royal Hotel.As the Superintendent loped up upon his
big brown horse the group broke apart and, like birds disturbed at their
feeding, circled about and closed again."Hello, here's Superintendent Strong," said a voice.There were many voices, all eager, and in them just a touch of anxiety."Not a thing do I know," said Superintendent Strong somewhat gravely."I have been up in the mountains and have heard little.I know that the
Commissioner has gone north to Prince Albert.""Yes, I heard we had a reverse there, and I know that General Middleton
has arrived at Qu'Appelle and has either set out for the north or is
about to set out."For a moment there was silence, then a deep voice replied:

"A ghastly massacre, women and children and priests."murmured the Superintendent in a low voice."Yes, half-breeds and Indians," replied the deep voice.The Superintendent sat on his big horse looking at them quietly, then he
said sharply:

"Men, there are some five or six thousand Indians in this district.""I have twenty-five men with me.Superintendent Cotton at Macleod has less than a hundred."The men sat their horses in silence looking at him.One could hear their
deep breathing and see the quiver of the horses under the gripping knees
of their riders.Ever since the news
of the Frog Lake massacre had spread like a fire across the country
these men had been carrying in their minds--rather, in their
hearts--pictures that started them up in their beds at night broad awake
and all in a cold sweat.He had only a single word to say, a short sharp word it was--

"Who will join me?"It was as if his question had released a spring drawn to its limit.From
twenty different throats in twenty different tones, but with a single
throbbing impulse, came the response, swift, full-throated, savage,
"Me!"and in three
minutes Superintendent Strong had secured the nucleus of his famous
scouts."To-morrow at nine at the Barracks!"said this grim and laconic
Superintendent, and was about turning away when a man came out from the
door of the Royal Hotel, drawn forth by that sudden savage yell.said the Superintendent, as the man moved toward the
sad-appearing broncho, "I want you."I am with you," was the reply as Cameron swung on to
his horse.he said to his horse, touching him with
his heel.Ginger woke up with an indignant snort and forthwith fell into
line with the Superintendent's big brown horse.The Superintendent was silent till the Barracks were gained, then,
giving the horses into the care of an orderly, he led Cameron into the
office and after they had settled themselves before the fire he began
without preliminaries."Cameron, I am more anxious than I can say about the situation here in
this part of the country.I have been away from the center of things for
some months and I have lost touch.I want you to let me know just what
is doing from our side.""I do not know much, sir," replied Cameron."I, too, have just come in
from a long parley with Crowfoot and his Chiefs.""Ah, by the way, how is the old boy?""At present he is very loyal, sir,--too loyal almost," said Cameron in
a doubtful tone."Duck Lake sent some of his young men off their heads a
bit, and Frog Lake even more.The Sarcees went wild over Frog Lake, you
know.""Oh, I don't worry about the Sarcees so much."Well, he has managed to hold down his younger Chiefs so far.He made
light of the Frog Lake affair, but he was most anxious to get from
me the fullest particulars of the Duck Lake fight.He made careful
inquiries as to just how many Police were in the fight.I could see that
it gave him a shock to learn that the Police had to retire.He was intensely anxious to learn also--though
he would not allow himself to appear so--just what the Government was
doing.""And what are the last reports from headquarters?You see I have not
been kept fully in touch.I know that the Commissioner has gone north to
Prince Albert and that General Middleton has taken command of the forces
in the West and has gone North with them from Qu'Appelle, but what
troops he has I have not heard.""I understand," replied Cameron, "that he has three regiments of
infantry from Toronto and three from Winnipeg, with the Winnipeg Field
Battery.A regiment from Quebec has arrived and one from Montreal and
there are more to follow."Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I know something about the
plan, I believe.There are three objective points, Prince Albert and
Battleford, both of which are now closely besieged, and Edmonton,
which is threatened with a great body of rebel Crees and Salteaux under
leadership of Little Pine and Big Bear.The Police at these points can
hardly be expected to hold out long against the overwhelming numbers
that are besieging them, and I expect that relief columns will be
immediately dispatched.Now, in regard to this district here, do you
know what is being done?""Well, General Strange has come in from his ranch and has offered his
services in raising a local force.""Yes, I was glad to hear that his offer had been accepted and that he
has been appointed to lead an expeditionary force from here to Edmonton.He is an experienced officer and I am sure will do us fine service.Now, about the South," continued the
Superintendent, "what about Fort Macleod?""The Superintendent there has offered himself and his whole force for
service in the North, but General Middleton, I understand, has asked him
to remain where he is and keep guard in this part of the country."The
Crees I do not fear so much.They are more restless and uncertain, but
God help us if the Blackfeet and the Bloods rise!That is why I called
for volunteers to-night.We cannot afford to be without a strong force
here a single day.""I gathered that you got some volunteers to-night.I hope, sir," said
Cameron, "you will have a place for me in your troop?""My dear fellow, nothing would please me better, I assure you," said
the Superintendent cordially."And as proof of my confidence in you I am
going to send you through the South country to recruit men for my troop.But as for you, you cannot leave
your present beat.The Sun Dance Trail cannot be abandoned for one hour.From it you keep an eye upon the secret movements of all the tribes in
this whole region and you can do much to counteract if not to wholly
check any hostile movement that may arise.Indeed, you have already done
more than any one will ever know to hold this country safe during these
last months.Remember, Cameron," added
the Superintendent impressively, "your work lies along the Sun Dance
Trail.On no account and for no reason must you be persuaded to abandon
that post.I shall get into touch with General Strange to-morrow and
shall doubtless get something to do, but if possible I should like you
to give me a day or two for this recruiting business before you take up
again your patrol work along the Sun Dance.""Very well, sir," replied Cameron quietly, trying hard to keep the
disappointment out of his voice."By the way, what are the
Piegans doing?""The Piegans," replied Cameron, "are industriously stealing cattle and
horses.I cannot quite make out just how they can manage to get away
with them.Eagle Feather is apparently running the thing, but there is
someone bigger than Eagle Feather in the game.An additional month or
two in the guardroom would have done that gentleman no harm.""Ah, has he been in the guard-room?"Oh, I pulled him out of the Sun Dance, where I found he had been
killing cattle, and the Superintendent at Macleod gave him two months to
meditate upon his crimes.""But now he is at his old habits again," continued Cameron."But his
is not the brain planning these raids.They are cleverly done and are
getting serious.For instance, I must have lost a score or two of steers
within the last three months.""What are they doing
with them all?""That is what I find difficult to explain.Either they are running them
across the border--though the American Police know nothing of it--or
they are making pemmican."that looks serious," said the Superintendent gravely."It makes me think that some one bigger
than Eagle Feather is at the bottom of all this cattle-running.Sometimes I have thought that perhaps that chap Raven has a hand in it.""He has brain enough and nerve in
plenty for any dare-devil exploit.""But," continued Cameron in a hesitating voice, "I cannot bring myself
to lay this upon him.""He is a cool hand and
desperate."Yes, I know he is all that, and yet--well--in this rebellion, sir,
I believe he is with us and against them."In proof of this Cameron
proceeded to relate the story of Raven's visit to the Big Horn Ranch."So you see," he concluded, "he would not care to work in connection
with the Piegans just now.""I don't know about that--I don't know about that," replied the
Superintendent."Of course he would not work against us directly, but he
might work for himself in this crisis.It would furnish him with a good
opportunity, you see."Yes, that is true, but still--I somehow cannot help liking the chap.""He is a cold-blooded
villain and cattle-thief, a murderer, as you know.If ever I get my hand
on him in this rumpus--Why, he's an outlaw pure and simple!I have
no use for that kind of man at all.The
Superintendent was indignant at the suggestion that any but the severest
measures should be meted out to a man of Raven's type.It was the
instinct and training of the Police officer responsible for the
enforcement of law and order in the land moving within him."But,"
continued the Superintendent, "let us get back to our plans.There must
be a strong force raised in this district immediately.We have the kind
of men best suited for the work all about us in this ranching country,
and I know that if you ride south throughout the ranges you can bring me
back fifty men, and there would be no finer anywhere.""I shall do what I can, sir," replied Cameron, "but I am not sure about
the fifty men."Long they talked over the plans, till it was far past midnight, when
Cameron took his leave and returned to his hotel.He put up his own
horse, looking after his feeding and bedding."You have some work to do, Ginger, for your Queen and country to-morrow,
and you must be fit," he said as he finished rubbing the horse down.And Ginger had work to do, but not that planned for him by his master,
as it turned out.At the door of the Royal Hotel, Cameron found waiting
him in the shadow a tall slim Indian youth."Who are you and what do you want?"As the youth stepped into the light there came to Cameron a dim
suggestion of something familiar about the lad, not so much in his face
as in his figure and bearing.The young man pulled up his trouser leg and showed a scarred ankle."Not" said the youth, throwing back his head with a haughty movement.The young man stood silent, evidently finding speech difficult."Eagle Feather," at length he said, "Little Thunder--plenty Piegan--run
much cattle."He made a sweeping motion with his arm to indicate the
extent of the cattle raid proposed.He shared with all wild things the
fear of inclosed places.Together they walked down the street and came to a restaurant.It is all right," said Cameron, offering his hand.The Indian took the offered hand, laid it upon his heart, then for a
full five seconds with his fierce black eye he searched Cameron's face.Satisfied, he motioned Cameron to enter and followed close on his heel.Never before had the lad been within four walls."Eat," said Cameron when the ordered meal was placed before them.The
lad was obviously ravenous and needed no further urging."Good going," said Cameron, letting his eye run down the lines of the
Indian's lithe figure.The lad's eye gleamed, but he shook his head.Here, John,"
he said to the Chinese waiter, "bring me a pipe.There," said Cameron,
passing the Indian the pipe after filling it, "smoke away."After another swift and searching look the lad took the pipe from
Cameron's hand and with solemn gravity began to smoke.It was to him
far more than a mere luxurious addendum to his meal.It was a solemn
ceremonial sealing a compact of amity between them."Now, tell me," said Cameron, when the smoke had gone on for some time.Slowly and with painful difficulty the youth told his story in terse,
brief sentences."T'ree day," he began, holding up three fingers, "me hear Eagle
Feather--many Piegans--talk--talk--talk.Go fight--keel--keel--keel all
white man, squaw, papoose.""You mean they are waiting for a runner from the North?""If the Crees win the fight then the Piegans will rise?"Come Cree Indian--then Piegan fight.""They will not rise until the runner comes, eh?""This day Eagle Feather run much cattle--beeg--beeg run."The young man
again swept the room with his arm.He is an old squaw," said Cameron.said Cameron, controlling his voice with an
effort.The lad nodded, his piercing eye upon Cameron's face.With startling suddenness he shot out the question.Not a line of the Indian's face moved.He ignored the question, smoking
steadily and looking before him."Ah, it is a strange way for Onawata to repay the white man's kindness
to his son," said Cameron.The contemptuous voice pierced the Indian's
armor of impassivity.Cameron caught the swift quiver in the face
that told that his stab had reached the quick.There is nothing in the
Indian's catalogue of crimes so base as the sin of ingratitude."Onawata beeg Chief--beeg Chief," at length the boy said proudly."He do
beeg--beeg t'ing.""Yes, he steals my cattle," said Cameron with stinging scorn."Little Thunder--Eagle Feather steal
cattle--Onawata no steal.""I am glad to hear it, then," said Cameron."This is a big run of
cattle, eh?""Yes--beeg--beeg run.""What will they do with all those cattle?"But again the Indian ignored his question and remained silently smoking."Why does the son of Onawata come to me?"A soft and subtle change transformed the boy's face.He pulled up his
trouser leg and, pointing to the scarred ankle, said:

"You' squaw good--me two leg--me come tell you take squaw 'way far--no
keel."Me go
now," he said, and passed out.cried Cameron, following him out to the door."Where are you
going to sleep to-night?"The boy waved his hand toward the hills surrounding the little town."Here," said Cameron, emptying his tobacco pouch into the boy's hand."I will tell my squaw that Onawata's son is not ungrateful, that he
remembered her kindness and has paid it back to me."For the first time a smile broke on the grave face of the Indian.He
took Cameron's hand, laid it upon his own heart, and then on Cameron's."You' squaw good--good--much good."He appeared to struggle to find
other words, but failing, and with a smile still lingering upon his
handsome face, he turned abruptly away and glided silent as a shadow
into the starlit night."Not a bad sort," he said to himself as he walked toward the hotel."Pretty tough thing for him to come here and give away his dad's scheme
like that--and I bet you he is keen on it himself too."CHAPTER XVIII

AN OUTLAW, BUT A MAN


The news brought by the Indian lad changed for Cameron all his plans.This cattle-raid was evidently a part of and preparation for the bigger
thing, a general uprising and war of extermination on the part of the
Indians.From his recent visit to the reserves he was convinced that the
loyalty of even the great Chiefs was becoming somewhat brittle and would
not bear any sudden strain put upon it.A successful raid of cattle such
as was being proposed escaping the notice of the Police, or in the teeth
of the Police, would have a disastrous effect upon the prestige of the
whole Force, already shaken by the Duck Lake reverse.The effect of
that skirmish was beyond belief.The victory of the half-breeds was
exaggerated in the wildest degree.His home
and his family and those of his neighbors were in danger of the most
horrible fate that could befall any human being.If the cattle-raid were
carried through by the Piegan Indians its sweep would certainly include
the Big Horn Ranch, and there was every likelihood that his home might
be destroyed, for he was an object of special hate to Eagle Feather and
to Little Thunder; and if Copperhead were in the business he had even
greater cause for anxiety.The Indian boy had taken three days to bring
the news.It would take a day and a night of hard riding to reach his
home.He passed into the hotel, found the
room of Billy the hostler and roused him up."Billy," he said, "get my horse out quick and hitch him up to the
post where I can get him.And Billy, if you love me," he implored, "be
quick!""Don't know what's eatin' you, boss," he said, "but quick's the word.""Martin, old man," cried Cameron, gripping him hard by the shoulder.That Indian boy you and Mandy pulled through
has just come all the way from the Piegan Reserve to tell me of a
proposed cattle-raid and a possible uprising of the Piegans in that
South country.The cattle-raid is coming on at once.The uprising
depends upon news from the Crees.I have promised Superintendent
Strong to spend the next two days recruiting for his new troop.Explain
to him why I cannot do this.Then ride like blazes
to Macleod and tell the Inspector all that I have told you and get him
to send what men he can spare along with you.It will likely finish where the
old Porcupine Trail joins the Sun Dance.Ride by
the ranch and get some of them there to show you the shortest trail.Both Mandy and Moira know it well."Let me get this clear," cried the doctor, holding him
fast by the arm."Two things I have gathered," said the doctor, speaking
rapidly, "first, a cattle-raid, then a general uprising, the uprising
dependent upon the news from the North.You want to block the
cattle-raid?"Then you want me to settle with Superintendent Storm, ride to Macleod
for men, then by your ranch and have them show me the shortest trail to
the junction of the Porcupine and the Sun Dance?""You are right, Martin, old boy.It is a great thing to have a head like
yours.I have been thinking
this thing over and I believe they mean to make pemmican in preparation
for their uprising, and if so they will make it somewhere on the Sun
Dance Trail.Cameron found Billy waiting with Ginger at the door of the hotel."Thank you, Billy," he said, fumbling in his pocket."Hang it, I can't
find my purse.""All right, then," said Cameron, giving him his hand.He caught Ginger by the mane and threw himself on the
saddle."Now, then, Ginger, you must not fail me this trip, if it is your last.A hundred and twenty miles, old boy, and you are none too fresh either.But, Ginger, we must beat them this time.A hundred and twenty miles
to the Big Horn and twenty miles farther to the Sun Dance, that makes
a hundred and forty, Ginger, and you are just in from a hard two days'
ride.For Ginger was showing
signs of eagerness beyond his wont."At all costs this raid must be
stopped," continued Cameron, speaking, after his manner, to his horse,
"not for the sake of a few cattle--we could all stand that loss--but to
balk at its beginning this scheme of old Copperhead's, for I believe
in my soul he is at the bottom of it.We need every
minute, but we cannot afford to make any miscalculations.The last
quarter of an hour is likely to be the worst."So on they went through the starry night.Steadily Ginger pounded the
trail, knocking off the miles hour after hour.There was no pause for
rest or for food.A few mouthfuls of water in the fording of a running
stream, a pause to recover breath before plunging into an icy river, or
on the taking of a steep coulee side, but no more.Hour after hour they
pressed forward toward the Big Horn Ranch.The night passed into morning
and the morning into the day, but still they pressed the trail.Toward the close of the day Cameron found himself within an hour's ride
of his own ranch with Ginger showing every sign of leg weariness and
almost of collapse.cried Cameron, leaning over him and patting his neck.Stick to it, old boy, a
little longer."A little snort and a little extra spurt of speed was the gallant
Ginger's reply, but soon he was forced to sink back again into his
stumbling stride."One hour more, Ginger, that is all--one hour only."As he spoke he leapt from his saddle to ease his horse in climbing a
long and lofty hill.As he surmounted the hill he stopped and swiftly
backed his horse down the hill.Upon the distant skyline his eye had
detected what he judged to be a horseman.His horse safely disposed of,
he once more crawled to the top of the hill.Carefully his eye swept the intervening valley and the hillside beyond,
but only this solitary figure could he see.As his eye rested on him the
Indian began to move toward the west.Cameron lay watching him for some
minutes.From his movements it was evident that the Indian's pace was
being determined by some one on the other side of the hill, for he
advanced now swiftly, now slowly.At times he halted and turned back
upon his track, then went forward again.He was too late now to be of
any service at his ranch.He wrung
his hands in agony to think of what might have happened.He was torn
with anxiety for his family--and yet here was the raid passing onward
before his eyes.One hour would bring him to the ranch, but if this were
the outside edge of the big cattle raid the loss of an hour would mean
the loss of everything.With his eyes still upon the Indian he forced himself to think more
quietly.The secrecy with which the raid was planned made it altogether
likely that the homes of the settlers would not at this time be
interfered with.At all costs
he must do what he could to head off the raid or to break the herd
in some way.But that meant in the first place a ride of twenty or
twenty-five miles over rough country.He crawled back to his horse and found him with his head close to the
ground and trembling in every limb."If he goes this twenty miles," he said, "he will go no more.But it
looks like our only hope, old boy.We must make for our old beat, the
Sun Dance Trail."He mounted his horse and set off toward the west, taking care never to
appear above the skyline and riding as rapidly as the uncertain footing
of the untrodden prairie would allow.At short intervals he would
dismount and crawl to the top of the hill in order to keep in touch
with the Indian, who was heading in pretty much the same direction as
himself.A little further on his screening hill began to flatten
itself out and finally it ran down into a wide valley which crossed
his direction at right angles.He made his horse lie down, still in the
shelter of the hill, and with most painful care he crawled on hands and
knees out to the open and secured a point of vantage from which he could
command the valley which ran southward for some miles till it, in turn,
was shut in by a further range of hills.Far down before him at the
bottom of the valley a line of cattle was visible and hurrying them
along a couple of Indian horsemen.As he lay watching these Indians he
observed that a little farther on this line was augmented by a similar
line from the east driven by the Indian he had first observed, and by
two others who emerged from a cross valley still further on.Prone upon
his face he lay, with his eyes on that double line of cattle and its
hustling drivers.What could one man do to check
it?Similar lines of cattle were coming down the different valleys and
would all mass upon the old Porcupine Trail and finally pour into the
Sun Dance with its many caves and canyons.There was much that was
mysterious in this movement still to Cameron.What could these Indians
do with this herd of cattle?The mere killing of them was in itself a
vast undertaking.He was perfectly familiar with the Indian's method of
turning buffalo meat, and later beef, into pemmican, but the killing,
and the dressing, and the rendering of the fat, and the preparing of the
bags, all this was an elaborate and laborious process.But one thing
was clear to his mind.At all costs he must get around the head of these
converging lines.He waited there till the valley was clear of cattle and Indians, then,
mounting his horse, he pushed hard across the valley and struck a
parallel trail upon the farther side of the hills.Pursuing this trail
for some miles, he crossed still another range of hills farther to the
west and so proceeded till he came within touch of the broken country
that marks the division between the Foothills and the Mountains.He had
not many miles before him now, but his horse was failing fast and he
himself was half dazed with weariness and exhaustion.Night, too, was
falling and the going was rough and even dangerous; for now hillsides
suddenly broke off into sharp cut-banks, twenty, thirty, forty feet
high.It was one of these cut-banks that was his undoing, for in the dim
light he failed to note that the sheep track he was following ended thus
abruptly till it was too late.Had his horse been fresh he could easily
have recovered himself, but, spent as he was, Ginger stumbled, slid and
finally rolled headlong down the steep hillside and over the bank on
to the rocks below.Cameron had just strength to throw himself from the
saddle and, scrambling on his knees, to keep himself from following his
horse.Around the cut-bank he painfully made his way to where his horse
lay with his leg broken, groaning like a human being in his pain.Those lines of cattle were
swiftly and steadily converging upon the Sun Dance.He had before him an
almost impossible achievement.Well he knew that a man on foot could do
little with the wild range cattle.They would speedily trample him into
the ground.But first there was a task that it wrung his heart to perform.His
horse must be put out of pain.He took off his coat, rolled it over his
horse's head, inserted his gun under its folds to deaden the sound and
to hide those luminous eyes turned so entreatingly upon him."Old boy, you have done your duty, and so must I. Good-by, old chap!"He
pulled the fatal trigger and Ginger's work was done.He took up his coat and set off once more upon the winding sheep trail
that he guessed would bring him to the Sun Dance.Dazed, half asleep,
numbed with weariness and faint with hunger, he stumbled on, while the
stars came out overhead and with their mild radiance lit up his rugged
way.Diagonally across the face of
the hill in front of him, a few score yards away and moving nearer, a
horse came cantering.Quickly Cameron dropped behind a jutting rock.Easily, daintily, with never a slip or slide came the horse till he
became clearly visible in the starlight.There was no mistaking that
horse or that rider.No other horse in all the territories could take
that slippery, slithery hill with a tread so light and sure, and no
other rider in the Western country could handle his horse with such
easy, steady grace among the rugged rocks of that treacherous hillside.He
is a villain, a black-hearted villain too.So, HE is the brains behind
this thing.He pulled the
wool over my eyes all right."The rage that surged up through his heart stimulated his dormant
energies into new life.With a deep oath Cameron pulled out both his
guns and set off up the hill on the trail of the disappearing horseman.His weariness fell from him like a coat, the spring came back to his
muscles, clearness to his brain.He was ready for his best fight and he
knew it lay before him.Swiftly, lightly he ran up the hillside.Before him lay a large Indian encampment with rows
upon rows of tents and camp fires with kettles swinging, and everywhere
Indians and squaws moving about.Skirting the camp and still keeping
to the side of the hill, he came upon a stout new-built fence that ran
straight down an incline to a steep cut-bank with a sheer drop of thirty
feet or more.Like a flash the meaning of it came upon him.This was to
be the end of the drive.Here
it was that the pemmican was to be made.On the hillside opposite there
was doubtless a similar fence and these two would constitute the fatal
funnel down which the cattle were to be stampeded over the cut-bank to
their destruction.This was the nefarious scheme planned by Raven and
his treacherous allies.Swiftly Cameron turned and followed the fence up the incline some three
or four hundred yards from the cut-bank.At its upper end the fence
curved outward for some distance upon a wide upland valley, then ceased
altogether.Such was the <DW72> of the hill that no living man could turn
a herd of cattle once entered upon that steep incline.Down the hill, across the valley and up the other side ran Cameron,
keeping low and carefully picking his way among the loose stones till he
came to the other fence which, curving similarly outward, made with its
fellow a perfectly completed funnel.Once between the curving lips of
this funnel nothing could save the rushing, crowding cattle from the
deadly cut-bank below."Oh, if I only had my horse," groaned Cameron, "I might have a chance to
turn them off just here."At the point at which he stood the <DW72> of the hillside fell somewhat
toward the left and away slightly from the mouth of the funnel.A
skilled cowboy with sufficient nerve, on a first-class horse, might turn
the herd away from the cut-bank into the little coulee that led down
from the end of the fence, but for a man on foot the thing was quite
impossible.He determined, however, to make the effort.No man can
certainly tell how cattle will behave when excited and at night.As he stood there rapidly planning how to divert the rush of cattle from
that deadly funnel, there rose on the still night air a soft rumbling
sound like low and distant thunder.It was the pounding of two hundred steers upon the resounding
prairie.He rushed back again to the right side of the fenced runway,
and then forward to meet the coming herd.A half moon rising over the
round top of the hill revealed the black surging mass of steers, their
hoofs pounding like distant artillery, their horns rattling like a
continuous crash of riflery.Before them at a distance of a hundred
yards or more a mounted Indian rode toward the farther side of the
funnel and took his stand at the very spot at which there was some hope
of diverting the rushing herd from the cut-bank down the side coulee to
safety."That man has got to go," said Cameron to himself, drawing his gun.But
before he could level it there shot out from the dim light behind the
Indian a man on horseback.Like a lion on its prey the horse leaped with
a wicked scream at the Indian pony.Before that furious leap both man
and pony went down and rolled over and over in front of the pounding
herd.Over the prostrate pony leaped the horse and up the hillside fair
in the face of that rushing mass of maddened steers.Straight across
their face sped the horse and his rider, galloping lightly, with never
a swerve or hesitation, then swiftly wheeling as the steers drew almost
level with him he darted furiously on their flank and rode close at
their noses.rang the rider's revolver, and two steers
in the far flank dropped to the earth while over them surged the
following herd.Again the revolver rang out, once, twice, thrice, and
at each crack a leader on the flank farthest away plunged down and was
submerged by the rushing tide behind.For an instant the column faltered
on its left and slowly began to swerve in that direction.Then upon the
leaders of the right flank the black horse charged furiously, biting,
kicking, plunging like a thing possessed of ten thousand devils.Steadily, surely the line continued to swerve.cried Cameron, unable to believe his eyes.With wild cries and discharging his revolver fair in the face of the
leaders, Cameron rushed out into the open and crossed the mouth of the
funnel.Cameron's sudden appearance gave the final and
necessary touch to the swerving movement.Across the mouth of the funnel
with its yawning deadly cut-bank, and down the side coulee, carrying
part of the fence with them, the herd crashed onward, with the black
horse hanging on their flank still biting and kicking with a kind of
joyous fury.Thank God,
he is straight after all!"A great tide of gratitude and admiration
for the outlaw was welling up in his heart.But even as he ran there
thundered past him an Indian on horseback, the reins flying loose and a
rifle in his hands.As he flashed past a gleam of moonlight caught his
face, the face of a demon.cried Cameron, whipping out his gun and firing, but
with no apparent effect, at the flying figure.With his gun still in his hand, Cameron ran on down the coulee in the
wake of Little Thunder.Far away could be heard the roar of the rushing
herd, but nothing could be seen of Raven.Running as he had never run in
his life, Cameron followed hard upon the Indian's track, who was by this
time some hundred yards in advance.Suddenly in the moonlight, and far
down the coulee, Raven could be seen upon his black horse cantering
easily up the <DW72> and toward the swiftly approaching Indian.Raven heard, looked up and saw the Indian bearing down upon him.His
horse, too, saw the approaching foe and, gathering himself, in two short
leaps rushed like a whirlwind at him, but, swerving aside, the Indian
avoided the charging stallion.Cameron saw his rifle go up to his
shoulder, a shot reverberated through the coulee, Raven swayed in his
saddle.A second shot and the black horse was fair upon the Indian pony,
hurling him to the ground and falling himself upon him.As the Indian
sprang to his feet Raven was upon him.He gripped him by the throat and
shook him as a dog shakes a rat.Once, twice, his pistol fell upon the
snarling face and the Indian crumpled up and lay still, battered to
death.cried Cameron, as he came up, struggling with his sobbing
breath."Yes, I have got him," said Raven, with his hand to his side, "but I
guess he has got me too.His eye fell upon his horse
lying upon his side and feebly kicking--"ah, I fear he has got you as
well, Nighthawk, old boy."As he staggered over toward his horse the
sound of galloping hoofs was heard coming down the coulee."All right, Cameron, my boy, just back up here beside me," said Raven,
as he coolly loaded his empty revolver."We can send a few more of these
devils to hell.You are a good sport, old chap, and I want to go out in
no better company."Raven had sunk to his knees beside his horse.They gathered round him, a
Mounted Police patrol picked up on the way by Dr.Martin, Moira who had
come to show them the trail, and Smith."Nighthawk, old boy," they heard Raven say, his hand patting the
shoulder of the noble animal, "he has done for you, I fear."His voice
came in broken sobs.The great horse lifted his beautiful head and
looked round toward his master."Ah, my boy, we have done many a journey
together!"cried Raven as he threw his arm around the glossy neck, "and
on this last one too we shall not be far apart."The horse gave a slight
whinny, nosed into his master's hand and laid his head down again.A
slight quiver of the limbs and he was still for ever.cried Raven, "my best, my only friend.""No, no," cried Cameron, "you are with friends now, Raven, old man."You are a true man, if God ever made one, and
you have shown it to-night."said Raven, with a kind of sigh as he sank back and leaned up
against his horse.It is long since I have had a
friend."said the doctor, kneeling down beside him and tearing
open his coat and vest."He is--" The
doctor paused abruptly.Moira threw
herself on her knees beside the wounded man and caught his hand."Oh, it
is cold, cold," she cried through rushing tears.The doctor was silently and swiftly working with his syringe."Half an hour, perhaps less," said the doctor brokenly.Cameron," he said, his voice
beginning to fail, "I want you to send a letter which you will find in
my pocket addressed to my brother.And add this,
that I forgive him.It was really not worth while," he added wearily,
"to hate him so.And say to the Superintendent I was on the straight
with him, with you all, with my country in this rebellion business.I
heard about this raid; and I fancy I have rather spoiled their pemmican.I have run some cattle in my time, but you know, Cameron, a fellow who
has worn the uniform could not mix in with these beastly breeds against
the Queen, God bless her!"Martin," cried the girl piteously, shaking him by the arm, "do
not tell me you can do nothing.She began again to
chafe the cold hand, her tears falling upon it."You are weeping for me, Miss Moira?"he said, surprise and wonder in
his face.A horse-thief, an outlaw, for me?And
forgive me--may I kiss your hand?"He tried feebly to lift her hand to
his lips.and leaning over him she kissed
him on the brow."Thank you," he said feebly, a rare, beautiful smile lighting up the
white face."You make me believe in God's mercy."There was a quick movement in the group and Smith was kneeling beside
the dying man.Raven," he said in an eager voice, "is infinite."Oh, yes," he said with a quaintly humorous smile, "you are the chap
that chucked Jerry away from the door?"Smith nodded, then said earnestly:

"Mr.Raven, you must believe in God's mercy.""God's mercy," said the dying man slowly.'God--be--merciful--to me--a sinner.'"Once more he opened his
eyes and let them rest upon the face of the girl bending over him."Yes," he said, "you helped me to believe in God's mercy."With a sigh
as of content he settled himself quietly against the shoulders of his
dead horse."Good old comrade," he said, "good-by!"He closed his eyes and drew a
deep breath.They waited for another, but there was no more.Ochone, but he was the gallant gentleman!"she wailed, lapsing into her Highland speech."Oh, but he had the brave
heart and the true heart.She swayed back and forth
upon her knees with hands clasped and tears running down her cheeks,
bending over the white face that lay so still in the moonlight and
touched with the majesty of death.said her brother surprised at her unwonted
display of emotion.She is in a hard spot," said Dr.Martin
in a sharp voice in which grief and despair were mingled.It was the face of a haggard old
man."You are used up, old boy," he said kindly, putting his hand on the
doctor's arm.And you too, Miss
Moira," he added gently."Come," giving her his hand, "you must get
home."There was in his voice a tone of command that made the girl look
up quickly and obey."Smith, the constable and I will look after--him--and the horse.Without further word the brother and sister mounted their horses."Good-night," said the doctor shortly."Good-night," she said simply, her eyes full of a dumb pain."Good-by, Miss Moira," said the doctor, who held her hand for just a
moment as if to speak again, then abruptly he turned his back on her
without further word and so stood with never a glance more after her.It was for him a final farewell to hopes that had lived with him and had
warmed his heart for the past three years.Now they were dead, dead as
the dead man upon whose white still face he stood looking down."Thief, murderer, outlaw," he muttered to himself.And yet you could not help it, nor could she."But he was not
thinking of the dead man's record in the books of the Mounted Police.CHAPTER XIX

THE GREAT CHIEF


On the rampart of hills overlooking the Piegan encampment the sun
was shining pleasantly.The winter, after its final savage kick, had
vanished and summer, crowding hard upon spring, was wooing the bluffs
and hillsides on their southern exposures to don their summer robes of
green.Not yet had the bluffs and hillsides quite yielded to the wooing,
not yet had they donned the bright green apparel of summer, but there
was the promise of summer's color gleaming through the neutral browns
and grays of the poplar bluffs and the sunny hillsides.The crocuses
with reckless abandon had sprung forth at the first warm kiss of the
summer sun and stood bravely, gaily dancing in their purple and gray,
till whole hillsides blushed for them.And the poplars, hesitating with
dainty reserve, shivered in shy anticipation and waited for a surer
call, still wearing their neutral tints, except where they stood
sheltered by the thick spruces from the surly north wind.There they
had boldly cast aside all prudery and were flirting in all their gallant
trappings with the ardent summer.Seeing none of all this, but dimly conscious of the good of it, Cameron
and his faithful attendant Jerry lay grimly watching through the
poplars.Three days had passed since the raid, and as yet there was no
sign at the Piegan camp of the returning raiders.Not for one hour
had the camp remained unwatched.Just long enough to bury his new-made
friend, the dead outlaw, did Cameron himself quit the post, leaving
Jerry on guard meantime, and now he was back again, with his glasses
searching every corner of the Piegan camp and watching every movement.There was upon his face a look that filled with joy his watchful
companion, a look that proclaimed his set resolve that when Eagle
Feather and his young men should appear in camp there would speedily be
swift and decisive action.For three days his keen eyes had looked forth
through the delicate green-brown screen of poplar upon the doings of the
Piegans, the Mounted Police meantime ostentatiously beating up the Blood
Reserve with unwonted threats of vengeance for the raiders, the bruit of
which had spread through all the reserves."Don't do anything rash," the Superintendent had admonished, as Cameron
appeared demanding three troopers and Jerry, with whom to execute
vengeance upon those who had brought death to a gallant gentleman and
his gallant steed, for both of whom there had sprung up in Cameron's
heart a great and admiring affection."No, sir," Cameron had replied, "nothing rash; we will do a little
justice, that is all," but with so stern a face that the Superintendent
had watched him away with some anxiety and had privately ordered a
strong patrol to keep the Piegan camp under surveillance till Cameron
had done his work.But there was no call for aid from any patrol, as it
turned out; and before this bright summer morning had half passed away
Cameron shut up his glasses, ready for action."I think they are all in now, Jerry," he said.There is that devil Eagle Feather just riding in."Cameron's teeth went hard together on the name of the Chief, in whom
the leniency of Police administration of justice had bred only a deeper
treachery.Within half an hour Cameron with his three troopers and Jerry rode
jingling into the Piegan camp and disposed themselves at suitable
points of vantage.Straight to the Chief's tent Cameron rode, and found
Trotting Wolf standing at its door."I want that cattle-thief, Eagle Feather," he announced in a clear, firm
voice that rang through the encampment from end to end."Eagle Feather not here," was Trotting Wolf's sullen but disturbed
reply."Trotting Wolf, I will waste no time on you," said Cameron, drawing his
gun.There was in Cameron's voice a ring of such compelling command that
Trotting Wolf weakened visibly."I know not where Eagle Feather--"

"Halt there!"cried Cameron to an Indian who was seen to be slinking
away from the rear of the line of tents.Like a whirlwind Cameron was on his trail
and before he had gained the cover of the woods had overtaken him.cried Cameron again as he reached the Indian's side.The Indian
stopped and drew a knife.Leaning
down over his horse's neck Cameron struck the Indian with the butt of
his gun.Before he could rise the three constables in a converging rush
were upon him and had him handcuffed.cried Cameron in a furious voice,
riding his horse into the crowd that had gathered thick about him."Ah,
I see you," he cried, touching his horse with his heel as on the farther
edge of the crowd he caught sight of his man.With a single bound his
horse was within touch of the shrinking Indian.cried Cameron, springing from his horse and striding to the Chief.he
added, as Eagle Feather stood irresolute before him.Upon the uplifted
hands Cameron slipped the handcuffs."Come with me, you cattle-thief,"
he said, seizing him by the gaudy handkerchief that adorned his neck,
and giving him a quick jerk."Trotting Wolf," said Cameron in a terrible voice, wheeling furiously
upon the Chief, "this cattle-thieving of your band must stop.I want the
six men who were in that cattle-raid, or you come with me.said Jerry, hugging himself in his delight, to the trooper who
was in charge of the first Indian."Look lak' he tak' de whole camp.""By Jove, Jerry, it looks so to me, too!He has got the fear of death on
these chappies.Cameron's face was gray, with purple blotches, and
distorted with passion, his eyes were blazing with fury, his manner one
of reckless savage abandon.The rumors
of vengeance stored up for the raiders, the paralyzing effect of the
failure of the raid, the condemnation of a guilty conscience, but
above all else the overmastering rage of Cameron, made anything like
resistance simply impossible.In a very few minutes Cameron had his
prisoners in line and was riding to the Fort, where he handed them over
to the Superintendent for justice.That business done, he found his patrol-work pressing upon him with a
greater insistence than ever, for the runners from the half-breeds and
the Northern Indians were daily arriving at the reserves bearing
reports of rebel victories of startling magnitude.But even without
any exaggeration tales grave enough were being carried from lip to lip
throughout the Indian tribes.Small wonder that the irresponsible young
Chiefs, chafing under the rule of the white man and thirsting for the
mad rapture of fight, were straining almost to the breaking point the
authority of the cooler older heads, so that even that subtle redskin
statesman, Crowfoot, began to fear for his own position in the Blackfeet
confederacy.As the days went on the Superintendent at Macleod, whose duty it was to
hold in statu quo that difficult country running up into the mountains
and down to the American boundary-line, found his task one that would
have broken a less cool-headed and stout-hearted officer.The situation in which he found himself seemed almost to invite
destruction.On the eighteenth of March he had sent the best of his men,
some twenty-five of them, with his Inspector, to join the Alberta Field
Force at Calgary, whence they made that famous march to Edmonton of over
two hundred miles in four and a half marching days.From Calgary, too,
had gone a picked body of Police with Superintendent Strong and his
scouts as part of the Alberta Field Force under General Strange.Thus
it came that by the end of April the Superintendent at Fort Macleod had
under his command only a handful of his trained Police, supported by two
or three companies of Militia--who, with all their ardor, were unskilled
in plain-craft, strange to the country, new to war, ignorant of the
habits and customs and temper of the Indians with whom they were
supposed to deal--to hold the vast extent of territory under his charge,
with its little scattered hamlets of settlers, safe in the presence of
the largest and most warlike of the Indian tribes in Western Canada.A crisis appeared to be
reached when the news came that on the twenty-fourth of April General
Middleton had met a check at Fish Creek, which, though not specially
serious in itself, revealed the possibilities of the rebel strategy and
gave heart to the enemy immediately engaged.And, though Fish Creek was no great fight, the rumor of it ran through
the Western reserves like red fire through prairie-grass, blowing almost
into flame the war-spirit of the young braves of the Bloods, Piegans
and Sarcees and even of the more stable Blackfeet.Three days after that
check, the news of it was humming through every tepee in the West,
and for a week or more it took all the cool courage and steady nerve
characteristic of the Mounted Police to enable them to ride without
flurry or hurry their daily patrols through the reserves.At this crisis it was that the Superintendent at Macleod gathered
together such of his officers and non-commissioned officers as he could
in council at Fort Calgary, to discuss the situation and to plan for all
possible emergencies.The full details of the Fish Creek affair had just
come in.They were disquieting enough, although the Superintendent made
light of them.On the wall of the barrack-room where the council was
gathered there hung a large map of the Territories.The Superintendent,
a man of small oratorical powers, undertook to set forth the disposition
of the various forces now operating in the West."Here you observe the main line running west from Regina to the
mountains, some five hundred and fifty miles," he said."And here,
roughly, two hundred and fifty miles north, is the northern boundary
line of our settlements, Prince Albert at the east, Battleford at the
center, Edmonton at the west, each of these points the center of a
country ravaged by half-breeds and bands of Indians.To each of these
points relief-expeditions have been sent."This line represents the march of Commissioner Irvine from Regina to
Prince Albert--a most remarkable march that was too, gentlemen, nearly
three hundred miles over snow-bound country in about seven days.That
march will be remembered, I venture to say.The Commissioner still holds
Prince Albert, and we may rely upon it will continue to hold it safe
against any odds.Meantime he is scouting the country round about,
preventing Indians from reinforcing the enemy in any large numbers."Next, to the west is Battleford, which holds the central position and
is the storm-center of the rebellion at present.This line shows the
march of Colonel Otter with Superintendent Herchmer from Swift Current
to that point.We have just heard that Colonel Otter has arrived at
Battleford and has raised the siege.But large bands of Indians are
in the vicinity of Battleford and the situation there is extremely
critical.I understand that old Oo-pee-too-korah-han-apee-wee-yin--" the
Superintendent prided himself upon his mastery of Indian names and
ran off this polysyllabic cognomen with the utmost facility--"the
Pond-maker, or Pound-maker as he has come to be called, is in the
neighborhood.He is not a bad fellow, but he is a man of unusual
ability, far more able than of the Willow Crees, Beardy, as he is
called, though not so savage, and he has a large and compact body of
Indians under him."Then here straight north from us some two hundred miles is Edmonton,
the center of a very wide district sparsely settled, with a strong
half-breed element in the immediate neighborhood and Big Bear and Little
Pine commanding large bodies of Indians ravaging the country round
about.Inspector Griesbach is in command of this district, located
at Fort Saskatchewan, which is in close touch with Edmonton.General
Strange, commanding the Alberta Field Force and several companies of
Militia, together with our own men under Superintendent Strong and
Inspector Dickson, are on the way to relieve this post.Inspector
Dickson, I understand, has successfully made the crossing of the Red
Deer with his nine pr.gun, a quite remarkable feat I assure you."But, gentlemen, you see the position in which we are placed in
this section of the country.From the Cypress Hills here away to the
southeast, westward to the mountains and down to the boundary-line,
you have a series of reserves almost completely denuded of Police
supervision.True, we are fortunate in having at the Blackfoot Crossing,
at Fort Calgary and at Fort Macleod, companies of Militia; but the very
presence of these troops incites the Indians, and in some ways is a
continual source of unrest among them."Every day runners from the North and East come to our reserves with
extraordinary tales of rebel victories.This Fish Creek business has had
a tremendous influence upon the younger element.On every reserve there
are scores of young braves eager to rise.What a general uprising would
mean you know, or think you know.An Indian war of extermination is
a horrible possibility.The question before us all is--what is to be
done?"After a period of conversation the Superintendent summed up the results
of the discussion in a few short sentences:

"It seems, gentlemen, there is not much more to be done than what we
are already doing.But first of all I need not say that we must keep our
nerve.I do not believe any Indian will see any sign of doubt or fear in
the face of any member of this Force.Our patrols must be regularly
and carefully done.There are a lot of things which we must not see, a
certain amount of lawbreaking which we must not notice.Avoid on every
possible occasion pushing things to extremes; but where it is necessary
to act we must act with promptitude and fearlessness, as Mr.Cameron
here did at the Piegan Reserve a week or so ago.I mention this because
I consider that action of Cameron's a typically fine piece of Police
work.We must keep on good terms with the Chiefs, tell them what good
news there is to tell.Arrest
them and bring them to the barracks.The situation is grave, but not
hopeless.I do not
believe that we shall fail."The little company broke up with resolute and grim determination stamped
on every face.There would be no weakening at any spot where a Mounted
Policeman was on duty."Cameron, just a moment," said the Superintendent as he was passing out.You were quite right in that Eagle Feather matter.You did
the right thing in pushing that hard.""I somehow felt I could do it, sir," replied Cameron simply."I had the
feeling in my bones that we could have taken the whole camp that day."And that is the way we should
feel.If any further reverse should happen to our troops it will be extremely
difficult, if indeed possible, to hold back the younger braves.If there
should be a rising--which may God forbid--my plan then would be to back
right on to the Blackfeet Reserve.If old Crowfoot keeps steady--and
with our presence to support him I believe he would--we could hold
things safe for a while.But, Cameron, that Sioux devil Copperhead must
be got rid of.It is he that is responsible for this restless spirit
among the younger Chiefs.He has been in the East, you say, for the last
three weeks, but he will soon be back.His
work lies here, and the only hope for the rebellion lies here, and he
knows it.My scouts inform me that there is something big immediately
on.A powwow is arranged somewhere before final action.I have reason to
suspect that if we sustain another reverse and if the minor Chiefs from
all the reserves come to an agreement, Crowfoot will yield.That is the
game that the Sioux is working on now.""I know that quite well, sir," replied Cameron."Copperhead has captured
practically all the minor Chiefs.""The checking of that big cattle-run, Cameron, was a mighty good stroke
for us."Yes, yes, we do owe a good deal to--to--that--to Raven.Yes, we owe a lot to him, but we owe a lot to you as
well, Cameron.I am not saying you will ever get any credit for it,
but--well--who cares so long as the thing is done?But this Sioux must
be got at all costs--at all costs, Cameron, remember.I have never
asked you to push this thing to the limit, but now at all costs, dead or
alive, that Sioux must be got rid of.""I could have potted him several times," replied Cameron, "but did not
wish to push matters to extremes."That has been our policy hitherto, but now
things have reached such a crisis that we can take no further chances."All right, sir," said Cameron, and a new purpose shaped itself in his
heart.At all costs he would get the Sioux, alive if possible, dead if
not.Plainly the first thing was to uncover his tracks, and with this
intention Cameron proceeded to the Blackfeet Reserve, riding with Jerry
down the Bow River from Fort Calgary, until, as the sun was setting on
an early May evening, he came in sight of the Blackfoot Crossing.Not wishing to visit the Militia camp at that point, and desiring
to explore the approaches of the Blackfeet Reserve with as little
ostentation as possible, he sent Jerry on with the horses, with
instructions to meet him later on in the evening on the outside of the
Blackfeet camp, and took a side trail on foot leading to the reserve
through a coulee.Through the bottom of the coulee ran a little
stream whose banks were packed tight with alders, willows and poplars.Following the trail to where it crossed the stream, Cameron left it for
the purpose of quenching his thirst, and proceeded up-stream some little
way from the usual crossing.Lying there prone upon his face he caught
the sound of hoofs, and, peering through the alders, he saw a line
of Indians riding down the opposite bank.Burying his head among the
tangled alders and hardly breathing, he watched them one by one cross
the stream not more than thirty yards away and clamber up the bank."Something doing here, sure enough," he said to himself as he noted
their faces.Three of them he knew, Red Crow of the Bloods, Trotting
Wolf of the Piegans, Running Stream of the Blackfeet, then came three
others unknown to Cameron, and last in the line Cameron was startled to
observe Copperhead himself, while close at his side could be seen the
slim figure of his son.As the Sioux passed by Cameron's hiding-place
he paused and looked steadily down into the alders for a moment or two,
then rode on."Saved yourself that time, old man," said Cameron as the Sioux
disappeared, following the others up the trail."We will see just which
trail you take," he continued, following them at a safe distance and
keeping himself hidden by the brush till they reached the open and
disappeared over the hill.Swiftly Cameron ran to the top, and, lying
prone among the prairie grass, watched them for some time as they took
the trail that ran straight westward."Sarcee Reserve more than likely," he muttered to himself.But he is not, so I must let them go in the meantime.Later, however, we shall come up with you, gentlemen.And now for old
Crowfoot and with no time to lose."He had only a couple of miles to go and in a few minutes he had reached
the main trail from the Militia camp at the Crossing.In the growing
darkness he could not discern whether Jerry had passed with the horses
or not, so he pushed on rapidly to the appointed place of meeting and
there found Jerry waiting for him.I have just seen him
and his son with Red Crow, Trotting Wolf and Running Stream.There were
three others--Sioux I think they are; at any rate I did not know them.They passed me in the coulee and took the Sarcee trail."From the reserve here anyway," answered Cameron."Trotting Wolf beeg Chief--Red Crow beeg Chief--ver' bad!Dunno me--look somet'ing--beeg powwow mebbe.Go
Sarcee Reserve, heh?""Come from h'east--by
Blood--Piegan--den Blackfeet--go Sarcee."That is the question, Jerry," said Cameron."Sout' to Weegwam?No, nord to Ghost Reever--Manitou
Rock--dunno--mebbe.""By Jove, Jerry, I believe you may be right.I don't think they would go
to the Wigwam--we caught them there once--nor to the canyon."Nord from Bow Reever by Kananaskis half day to Ghost Reever--bad
trail--small leetle reever--ver' stony--ver' cold--beeg tree wit' long
beard.""Yes--long, long gray moss lak' beard--ver' strange place dat--from
Ghost Reever west one half day to beeg Manitou Rock--no trail.Beeg
medicine-dance dere--see heem once long tam' 'go--leetle boy me--beeg
medicine--Indian debbil stay dere--Indian much scare'--only go when mak'
beeg tam'--beeg medicine.""Let me see if I get you, Jerry.A bad trail leads half a day north from
the Bow at Kananaskis to Ghost River, eh?""Then up the Ghost River westward through the bearded trees half a day
to the Manitou Rock?"Beeg dat tree," pointing to a tall poplar,
"and cut straight down lak some knife--beeg rock--black rock.""What I want to know just now is does
Crowfoot know of this thing?Copperhead has just come from the reserve.It is possible, just possible, that he may not have seen Crowfoot.Now, Jerry, you must follow Copperhead, find out
where he has gone and all you can about this business, and meet me
where the trail reaches the Ghost River.Take a
trooper with you to look after the horses.If you are not at the Ghost River I shall go right on--that is if I see
any signs."And without further word he slipped on to his
horse and disappeared into the darkness, taking the cross-trail through
the coulee by which Cameron had come.Crowfoot's camp showed every sign of the organization and discipline of
a master spirit.The tents and houses in which his Indians lived were
extended along both sides of a long valley flanked at both ends by
poplar-bluffs.At the bottom of the valley there was a series of
"sleughs" or little lakes, affording good grazing and water for the
herds of cattle and ponies that could be seen everywhere upon the
hillsides.At a point farthest from the water and near to a poplar-bluff
stood Crowfoot's house.At the first touch of summer, however,
Crowfoot's household had moved out from their dwelling, after the manner
of the Indians, and had taken up their lodging in a little group of
tents set beside the house.Toward this little group of tents Cameron rode at an easy lope.He found
Crowfoot alone beside his fire, except for the squaws that were cleaning
up after the evening meal and the papooses and older children rolling
about on the grass.As Cameron drew near, all vanished, except Crowfoot
and a youth about seventeen years of age, whose strongly marked features
and high, fearless bearing proclaimed him Crowfoot's son.Dismounting,
Cameron dropped the reins over his horse's head and with a word of
greeting to the Chief sat down by the fire.Crowfoot acknowledged his
salutation with a suspicious look and grunt."Nice night, Crowfoot," said Cameron cheerfully."Good weather for the
grass, eh?""Good," said Crowfoot gruffly.Cameron pulled out his tobacco pouch and passed it to the Chief.With an
air of indescribable condescension Crowfoot took the pouch, knocked the
ashes from his pipe, filled it from the pouch and handed it back to the
owner.inquired Cameron, holding out the pouch toward the youth.grunted Crowfoot with a slight relaxing of his face.The lad stood like a statue, and, except for a slight stiffening of
his tall lithe figure, remained absolutely motionless, after the Indian
manner."Getting cold," said Cameron at length, as he kicked the embers of the
fire together.Crowfoot spoke to his son and the lad piled wood on the fire till it
blazed high, then, at a sign from his father, he disappeared into the
tent.That is better," said Cameron, stretching out his hands toward the
fire and disposing himself so that the old Chief's face should be set
clearly in its light.said Crowfoot in his own language,
after a long silence."Oh, sometimes," replied Cameron carelessly, "when cattle-thieves ride
too.""Yes, some Indians forget all that the Police have done for them,
and like coyotes steal upon the cattle at night and drive them over
cut-banks."inquired Crowfoot again, apparently much interested."Yes," continued Cameron, fully aware that he was giving the old Chief
no news, "Eagle Feather will be much wiser when he rides over the plains
again.""But Eagle Feather," continued Cameron, "is not the worst Indian.He is
no good, only a little boy who does what he is told.""Yes, he is an old squaw serving his Chief."again inquired Crowfoot, moving his pipe from his mouth in his
apparent anxiety to learn the name of this unknown master of Eagle
Feather."Onawata, the Sioux, is a great Chief," said Cameron."He makes all the little Chiefs, Blood, Piegan, Sarcee, Blackfeet obey
him," said Cameron in a scornful voice, shading his face from the fire
with his hand."But he has left this country for a while?""My brother has not seen this Sioux for some weeks?"Again Cameron's
hand shaded his face from the fire while his eyes searched the old
Chief's impassive countenance.Onawata bad man--make much
trouble.""The big war is going on good," said Cameron, abruptly changing the
subject."At Fish Creek the half-breeds and Indians had a
good chance to wipe out General Middleton's column."And he proceeded
to give a graphic account of the rebels' opportunity at that unfortunate
affair."But," he concluded, "the half-breeds and Indians have no
Chief.""No Chief," agreed Crowfoot with emphasis, his old eyes gleaming in
the firelight."Where Big Bear--Little
Pine--Kah-mee-yes-too-waegs and Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin?""Oh," said Cameron, "here, there, everywhere."No big Chief," grunted Crowfoot in disgust."One big Chief make
all Indians one."It seemed worth while to Cameron to take a full hour from his precious
time to describe fully the operations of the troops and to make clear
to the old warrior the steady advances which the various columns were
making, the points they had relieved and the ultimate certainty of
victory."Six thousand men now in the West," he concluded, "besides the Police.Old Crowfoot was evidently much impressed and was eager to learn more."I must go now," said Cameron, rising.he
asked, suddenly facing Crowfoot.Running Stream he go hunt--t'ree day--not come back," answered
Crowfoot quickly.Cameron sat down again by the fire, poked up the embers till the blaze
mounted high."Crowfoot," he said solemnly, "this day Onawata was in this camp and
spoke with you.he said, putting up his hand as the old Chief
was about to speak."This evening he rode away with Running Stream, Red
Crow, Trotting Wolf.The Sioux for many days has been leading about your
young men like dogs on a string.To-day he has put the string round the
necks of Red Crow, Running Stream, Trotting Wolf.I did not think he
could lead Crowfoot too like a little dog.he said again as Crowfoot rose to his feet in indignation.And the Police will take the
Chiefs that he led round like little dogs and send them away.The Great
Mother cannot have men as Chiefs whom she cannot trust.For many years
the Police have protected the Indians.It was Crowfoot himself who once
said when the treaty was being made--Crowfoot will remember--'If the
Police had not come to the country where would we all be now?Bad men
and whisky were killing us so fast that very few indeed of us would have
been left to-day.The Police have protected us as the feathers of the
bird protect it from the frosts of winter.'This is what Crowfoot said
to the Great Mother's Councilor when he made a treaty with the Great
Mother."Here Cameron rose to his feet and stood facing the Chief.Does he give his hand and draw it back again?It is not good that, when trouble comes, the Indians should join the
enemies of the Police and of the Great Mother across the sea.These
enemies will be scattered like dust before the wind.Does Crowfoot think
when the leaves have fallen from the trees this year there will be any
enemies left?This Sioux dog does not know the Great Mother, nor
her soldiers, nor her Police.Why does he talk to the
enemies of the Great Mother and of his friends the Police?I go to-night to take Onawata.Already my men are upon his
trail.With Onawata and the little Chiefs
he leads around or with the Great Mother and the Police?For some moments while Cameron was
speaking he had been eagerly seeking an opportunity to reply, but
Cameron's passionate torrent of words prevented him breaking in without
discourtesy.When Cameron ceased, however, the old Chief stretched out
his hand and in his own language began:

"Many years ago the Police came to this country.My people then were
poor--"

At this point the sound of a galloping horse was heard, mingled with the
loud cries of its rider.Crowfoot paused and stood intently listening.Cameron could get no meaning from the shouting.From every tent men came
running forth and from the houses along the trail on every hand, till
before the horse had gained Crowfoot's presence there had gathered about
the Chief's fire a considerable crowd of Indians, whose numbers were
momentarily augmented by men from the tents and houses up and down the
trail.In calm and dignified silence the old Chief waited the rider's word.He
was an Indian runner and he bore an important message.Dismounting, the runner stood, struggling to recover his breath and to
regain sufficient calmness to deliver his message in proper form to the
great Chief of the Blackfeet confederacy.While he stood thus struggling
with himself Cameron took the opportunity to closely scrutinize his
face."I remember him--an impudent cur."He moved
quietly toward his horse, drew the reins up over his head, and, leading
him back toward the fire, took his place beside Crowfoot again.The Sarcee had begun his tale, speaking under intense excitement which
he vainly tried to control.Such was the
rapidity and incoherence of his speech, however, that Cameron could make
nothing of it.The effect upon the crowd was immediate and astounding.On every side rose wild cries of fierce exultation, while at Cameron
angry looks flashed from every eye.Old Crowfoot alone remained quiet,
calm, impassive, except for the fierce gleaming of his steady eyes.When the runner had delivered his message he held up his hand and
spoke but a single word.Immediately there was silence as of the grave.Nothing was heard, not even the breathing of the Indians close about
him.In sharp, terse sentences the old Chief questioned the runner, who
replied at first eagerly, then, as the questions proceeded, with some
hesitation.Finally, with a wave of the hand Crowfoot dismissed him and
stood silently pondering for some moments.Then he turned to his people
and said with quiet and impressive dignity:

"This is a matter for the Council.Then
turning to Cameron he said in a low voice and with grave courtesy, "It
is wise that my brother should go while the trails are open.""The trails are always open to the Great Mother's Mounted Police," said
Cameron, looking the old Chief full in the eye.Crowfoot stood silent, evidently thinking deeply."It is right that my brother should know," he said at length, "what the
runner tells," and in his deep guttural voice there was a ring of pride."Good news is always welcome," said Cameron, as he coolly pulled out his
pipe and offered his pouch once more to Crowfoot, who, however, declined
to see it."The white soldiers have attacked the Indians and have been driven
back," said Crowfoot with a keen glance at Cameron's face.They went against
Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin and the Indians did not run away."No
words could describe the tone and attitude of exultant and haughty pride
with which the old Chief delivered this information."Crowfoot," said Cameron with deliberate emphasis, "it was Colonel Otter
and Superintendent Herchmer of the Mounted Police that went north
to Battleford.You do not know Colonel Otter, but you do know
Superintendent Herchmer.Tell me, would Superintendent Herchmer and the
Police run away?""The runner tells that the white soldiers ran away," said Crowfoot
stubbornly.Cameron's voice rang out loud and clear.Swift as a lightning flash the Sarcee sprang at Cameron, knife in hand,
crying in the Blackfeet tongue that terrible cry so long dreaded by
settlers in the Western States of America, "Death to the white man!"Without apparently moving a muscle, still holding by the mane of his
horse, Cameron met the attack with a swift and well-placed kick which
caught the Indian's right wrist and flung his knife high in the air.Following up the kick, Cameron took a single step forward and met the
murderous Sarcee with a straight left-hand blow on the jaw that landed
the Indian across the fire and deposited him kicking amid the crowd.Immediately there was a quick rush toward the white man, but the rush
halted before two little black barrels with two hard, steady, gray eyes
gleaming behind them."I hold ten dead Indians in my hands."With a single stride Crowfoot was at Cameron's side.A single sharp
stern word of command he uttered and the menacing Indians slunk back
into the shadows, but growling like angry beasts."Is it wise to anger my young men?""Is it wise," replied Cameron sternly, "to allow mad dogs to run loose?"Huh," grunted Crowfoot with a shrug of his shoulders.Then in a lower voice he added earnestly, "It would be good to take the
trail before my young men can catch their horses.""I was just going, Crowfoot," said Cameron, stooping to light his
pipe at the fire.And Cameron
cantered away with both hands low before him and guiding his broncho
with his knees, and so rode easily till safely beyond the line of the
reserve.Once out of the reserve he struck his spurs hard into his horse
and sent him onward at headlong pace toward the Militia camp.Ten minutes after his arrival at the camp every soldier was in his place
ready to strike, and so remained all night, with pickets thrown far out
listening with ears attent for the soft pad of moccasined feet.CHAPTER XX

THE LAST PATROL


It was still early morning when Cameron rode into the barrack-yard at
Fort Calgary.To the Sergeant in charge, the Superintendent of Police
having departed to Macleod, he reported the events of the preceding
night.he inquired after he had told his
tale."Well, I had the details yesterday," replied the Sergeant."Colonel
Otter and a column of some three hundred men with three guns went out
after Pound-maker.The Indians were apparently strongly posted and could
not be dislodged, and I guess our men were glad to get out of the scrape
as easily as they did."cried Cameron, more to himself than to the officer,
"what will this mean to us here?""Well, my business presses all the more," said Cameron.I suppose you cannot let
me have three or four men?There is liable to be trouble and we cannot
afford to make a mess of this thing.""Jerry came in last night asking for a man," replied the Sergeant, "but
I could not spare one.However, we will do our best and send you on the
very first men that come in.""Send on half a dozen to-morrow at the very latest," replied Cameron.He left a plan of the Ghost River Trail with the Sergeant and rode to
look up Dr.He found the doctor still in bed and wrathful at
being disturbed."I say, Cameron," he growled, "what in thunder do you mean by roaming
round this way at night and waking up Christian people out of their
sleep?""Sorry, old boy," replied Cameron, "but my business is rather
important."And then while the doctor sat and shivered in his night clothes upon the
side of the bed Cameron gave him in detail the history of the previous
evening and outlined his plan for the capture of the Sioux.Martin listened intently, noting the various points and sketching an
outline of the trail as Cameron described it."I wanted you to know, Martin, in case anything happened.For, well, you
know how it is with my wife just now.Good-by," said Cameron, pressing his hand."This
I feel is my last go with old Copperhead.""Oh, don't be alarmed," he replied lightly."I am going to get him this
time.Well, good-by, I am off.By the way, the Sergeant at the barracks has promised to send on half
a dozen men to-morrow to back me up.You might just keep him in mind of
that, for things are so pressing here that he might quite well imagine
that he could not spare the men.""Well, that is rather better," said Martin."The Sergeant will send
those men all right, or I will know the reason why.A day's ride brought Cameron to Kananaskis, where the Sun Dance Trail
ends on one side of the Bow River and the Ghost River Trail begins on
the other.There he found signs to indicate that Jerry was before him
on his way to the Manitou Rock.As Cameron was preparing to camp for
the night there came over him a strong but unaccountable presentiment
of approaching evil, an irresistible feeling that he ought to press
forward."I suppose it is the Highlander in me that is seeing visions and
dreaming dreams.I must eat, however, no matter what is going to
happen."Leaving his horse saddled, but removing the bridle, he gave him his
feed of oats, then he boiled his tea and made his own supper.As he was
eating the feeling grew more strongly upon him that he should not camp
but go forward at once.At the same time he made the discovery that the
weariness that had almost overpowered him during the last half-hour
of his ride had completely vanished.Hence, with the feeling of half
contemptuous anger at himself for yielding to his presentiment, he
packed up his kit again, bridled his horse, and rode on.The trail was indeed, as Jerry said, "no trail."It was rugged with
broken rocks and cumbered with fallen trees, and as it proceeded became
more indistinct.His horse, too, from sheer weariness, for he had
already done his full day's journey, was growing less sure footed and
so went stumbling noisily along.Cameron began to regret his folly in
yielding to a mere unreasoning imagination and he resolved to spend the
night at the first camping-ground that should offer.The light of the
long spring day was beginning to fade from the sky and in the forest the
deep shadows were beginning to gather.Still no suitable camping-ground
presented itself and Cameron stubbornly pressed forward through the
forest that grew denser and more difficult at every step.After some
hours of steady plodding the trees began to be sensibly larger, the
birch and poplar gave place to spruce and pine and the underbrush almost
entirely disappeared.The trail, too, became better, winding between
the large trees which, with clean trunks, stood wide apart and arranged
themselves in stately high-arched aisles and long corridors.From the
lofty branches overhead the gray moss hung in long streamers, as Jerry
had said, giving to the trees an ancient and weird appearance.Along
these silent, solemn, gray-festooned aisles and corridors Cameron rode
with an uncanny sensation that unseen eyes were peering out upon him
from those dim and festooned corridors on either side.Impatiently he
strove to shake off the feeling, but in vain.At length, forced by
the growing darkness, he decided to camp, when through the shadowy and
silent forest there came to his ears the welcome sound of running water.It was to Cameron like the sound of a human voice.He almost called
aloud to the running stream as to a friend.In a few minutes he had reached the water and after picketing his horse
some little distance down the stream and away from the trail, he
rolled himself in his blanket to sleep.The moon rising above the high
tree-tops filled the forest aisles with a soft unearthly light.As his
eye followed down the long dim aisles there grew once more upon him
the feeling that he was being watched by unseen eyes.Vainly he cursed
himself for his folly.He
lay still listening with every nerve taut.He fancied he could hear soft
feet about him and stealing near.With his two guns in hand he sat bolt
upright.Straight before him and not more than ten feet away the form of
an Indian was plainly to be seen.A slight sound to his right drew his
eyes in that direction.There, too, stood the silent form of an Indian,
on his left also an Indian.Suddenly from behind him a deep, guttural
voice spoke, "Look this way!"He turned sharply and found himself gazing
into a rifle-barrel a few feet from his face.He glanced to right and left, only to find rifles leveled at him
from every side."White man put down his guns on ground!""Indian speak no more," said the voice in a deep growl.Out from behind the Indian with the leveled rifle glided
another Indian form.All thought of resistance passed from Cameron's mind.It would mean
instant death, and, what to Cameron was worse than death, the certain
failure of his plans.Besides, there
would be the Police next day.With savage, cruel haste Copperhead bound his hands behind his back and
as a further precaution threw a cord about his neck.he said, giving the cord a quick jerk."Copperhead," said Cameron through his clenched teeth, "you will one day
wish you had never done this thing."said Copperhead gruffly, jerking the cord so heavily as
almost to throw Cameron off his feet.Through the night Cameron stumbled on with his captors, Copperhead in
front and the others following.Half dead with sleeplessness and blind
with rage he walked on as if in a hideous nightmare, mechanically
watching the feet of the Indian immediately in front of him and thus
saving himself many a cruel fall and a more cruel jerking of the cord
about his neck, for such was Copperhead's method of lifting him to his
feet when he fell.It seemed to him as if the night would never pass or
the journey end.At length the throbbing of the Indian drum fell upon his ears.Nothing could be much more agonizing than what he
was at present enduring.As they approached the Indian camp one of his
captors raised a wild, wailing cry which resounded through the forest
with an unearthly sound.Never had such a cry fallen upon Cameron's
ears.It was the old-time cry of the Indian warriors announcing that
they were returning in triumph bringing their captives with them.Again the cry was raised, when from the Indian
encampment came in reply a chorus of similar cries followed by a rush
of braves to meet the approaching warriors and to welcome them and their
captives.With loud and discordant exultation straight into the circle of the
firelight cast from many fires Copperhead and his companions marched
their captive.On every side naked painted Indians to the number of
several score crowded in tumultuous uproar.Not for many years had these
Indians witnessed their ancient and joyous sport of baiting a prisoner.As Cameron came into the clear light of the fire instantly low murmurs
ran round the crowd, for to many of them he was well known.His presence there was clearly a shock to many of
them.To take prisoner one of the Mounted Police and to submit him to
indignity stirred strange emotions in their hearts.The keen eye of
Copperhead noted the sudden change of the mood of the Indians and
immediately he gave orders to those who held Cameron in charge, with the
result that they hurried him off and thrust him into a little low hut
constructed of brush and open in front where, after tying his feet
securely, they left him with an Indian on guard in front.For some moments Cameron lay stupid with weariness and pain till his
weariness overpowered his pain and he sank into sleep.He was recalled
to consciousness by the sensation of something digging into his ribs.As
he sat up half asleep a low "hist!"His heart
leaped as he heard out of the darkness a whispered word, "Jerry here."Cameron rolled over and came close against the little half-breed, bound
as he was himself."Me all lak' youse'f," said Jerry.The Indian on guard was eagerly looking and listening to what was going
on before him beside the fire.At one side of the circle sat the Indians
in council.Copperhead was standing and speaking to them.said Cameron, his mouth close to Jerry's ear."He say dey keel us queeck.Say he keel us heemse'f--queeck."Again and again and with ever increasing vehemence Copperhead urged his
views upon the hesitating Indians, well aware that by involving them in
such a deed of blood he would irrevocably commit them to rebellion.But
he was dealing with men well-nigh as subtle as himself, and for the very
same reason as he pressed them to the deed they shrank back from it.They were not yet quite prepared to burn their bridges behind them.Indeed some of them suggested the wisdom of holding the prisoners as
hostages in case of necessity arising in the future."Piegan, Sarcee, Blood," breathed Jerry."No Blackfeet come--not
yet--Copperhead he look, look, look all yesterday for Blackfeet
coming.Blackfeet come to-morrow mebbe--den Indian mak' beeg medicine.Copperhead he go meet Blackfeet dis day--he catch you--he go 'gain
to-morrow mebbe--dunno."Meantime the discussion in the council was drawing to a climax.With
the astuteness of a true leader Copperhead ceased to urge his view, and,
unable to secure the best, wisely determined to content himself with the
second-best.His vehement tone gave place to one of persuasion.Finally
an agreement appeared to be reached by all.With one consent the council
rose and with hands uplifted they all appeared to take some solemn oath."He say," replied Jerry, "he go meet Blackfeet and when he bring 'em
back den dey keel us sure t'ing.But," added Jerry with a cheerful
giggle, "he not keel 'em yet, by Gar!"For some minutes they waited in silence, then they saw Copperhead with
his bodyguard of Sioux disappear from the circle of the firelight into
the shadows of the forest.Even before he had finished speaking Cameron had lain back upon the
ground and in spite of the pain in his tightly bound limbs such was his
utter exhaustion that he fell fast asleep.It seemed to him but a moment when he was again awakened by the touch
of a hand stealing over his face.The hand reached his lips and rested
there, when he started up wide-awake.A soft hiss from the back of the
hut arrested him."No noise," said a soft guttural voice.Again the hand was thrust
through the brush wall, this time bearing a knife."Cut string,"
whispered the voice, while the hand kept feeling for the thongs that
bound Cameron's hands.In a few moments Cameron was free from his bonds."Tell you squaw," said the voice, "sick boy not forget."The boy
laid his hand on Cameron's lips and was gone.Slowly they wormed their way through the flimsy
brush wall at the back, and, crouching low, looked about them.The fires were smoldering in their ashes.Lying across the front of their little hut the
sleeping form of their guard could be seen.The forest was still black
behind them, but already there was in the paling stars the faint promise
of the dawn.Hardly daring to breathe, they rose and stood looking at
each other."No stir," said Jerry with his lips at Cameron's ear.He dropped on his
hands and knees and began carefully to remove every twig from his path
so that his feet might rest only upon the deep leafy mold of the
forest.Carefully Cameron followed his example, and, working slowly and
painfully, they gained the cover of the dark forest away from the circle
of the firelight.Scarcely had they reached that shelter when an Indian rose from beside
a fire, raked the embers together, and threw some sticks upon it.As
Cameron stood watching him, his heart-beat thumping in his ears, a
rotten twig snapped under his feet.The Indian turned his face in their
direction, and, bending forward, appeared to be listening intently.Instantly Jerry, stooping down, made a scrambling noise in the leaves,
ending with a thump upon the ground.Immediately the Indian relaxed his
listening attitude, satisfied that a rabbit was scurrying through the
forest upon his own errand bent.Rigidly silent they stood, watching him
till long after he had lain down again in his place, then once more they
began their painful advance, clearing treacherous twigs from every place
where their feet should rest.Fortunately for their going the forest
here was largely free from underbrush.Working carefully and painfully
for half an hour, and avoiding the trail by the Ghost River, they made
their way out of hearing of the camp and then set off at such speed as
their path allowed, Jerry in the lead and Cameron following.inquired Cameron as the little half-breed,
without halt or hesitation, went slipping through the forest.I want to talk to you," said Cameron."All right," said Cameron, following close upon his heels.The morning broadened into day, but they made no pause till they had
left behind them the open timber and gained the cover of the forest
where the underbrush grew thick.Then Jerry, finding a dry and sheltered
spot, threw himself down and stretched himself at full length waiting
for Cameron's word."Non," replied the little man scornfully."When lie down tak' 'em easy."Copperhead is on his way to meet the Blackfeet, but
I fancy he is going to be disappointed."Then Cameron narrated to Jerry
the story of his recent interview with Crowfoot."So I don't think," he
concluded, "any Blackfeet will come.Copperhead and Running Stream are
going to be sold this time.Besides that the Police are on their way to
Kananaskis following our trail.They will reach Kananaskis to-night and
start for Ghost River to-morrow.We ought to get Copperhead between us
somewhere on the Ghost River trail and we must get him to-day.Jerry considered the matter, then, pointing straight eastward, he
replied:

"On trail Kananaskis not far from Ghost Reever.""He would have to sleep and
eat, Jerry."No sleep--hit sam' tam' he run.""Then it is quite possible," said Cameron, "that we may head him off.""Mebbe--dunno how fas' he go," said Jerry."By the way, Jerry, when do we eat?""Pull belt tight," said Jerry with a grin."Do you mean to say you had the good sense to cache some grub, Jerry, on
your way down?""Jerry lak' squirrel," replied the half-breed."Cache grub many
place--sometam come good.""Halfway Kananaskis to Ghost Reever.""Then, Jerry, we must make that Ghost River trail and make it quick if
we are to intercept Copperhead."We mus' mak' beeg speed for sure."And "make big speed" they
did, with the result that by midday they struck the trail not far from
Jerry's cache.As they approached the trail they proceeded with extreme
caution, for they knew that at any moment they might run upon Copperhead
and his band or upon some of their Indian pursuers who would assuredly
be following them hard.A careful scrutiny of the trail showed that
neither Copperhead nor their pursuers had yet passed by."Come now ver' soon," said Jerry, as he left the trail, and, plunging
into the brush, led the way with unerring precision to where he had made
his cache.Quickly they secured the food and with it made their way back
to a position from which they could command a view of the trail."Go sleep now," said Jerry, after they had done.Gladly Cameron availed himself of the opportunity to catch up his sleep,
in which he was many hours behind.He stretched himself on the ground
and in a moment's time lay as completely unconscious as if dead.But
before half of his allotted time was gone he was awakened by Jerry's
hand pressing steadily upon his arm."Indian come," whispered the half-breed.Instantly Cameron was
wide-awake and fully alert.he asked, lying with his ear to the ground.Almost as Jerry was speaking the figure of an
Indian came into view, running with that tireless trot that can wear out
any wild animal that roams the woods.whispered Cameron, tightening his belt and making as if to
rise.Following Copperhead, and running not close upon him but at some
distance behind, came another Indian, then another, till three had
passed their hiding-place."Four against two, Jerry," said Cameron.They have
their knives, I see, but only one gun.We have no guns and only one
knife.But Jerry, we can go in and kill them with our bare hands."He had fought too often against much greater
odds in Police battles to be unduly disturbed at the present odds.Silently and at a safe distance behind they fell into the wake of the
running Indians, Jerry with his moccasined feet leading the way.Mile
after mile they followed the trail, ever on the alert for the doubling
back of those whom they were pursuing.Suddenly Cameron heard a sharp
hiss from Jerry in front.Swiftly he flung himself into the brush and
lay still.Within a minute he saw coming back upon the trail an Indian,
silent as a shadow and listening at every step.The Indian passed his
hiding-place and for some minutes Cameron lay watching until he saw him
return in the same stealthy manner.After some minutes had elapsed a
soft hiss from Jerry brought Cameron cautiously out upon the trail once
more.A second time during the afternoon Jerry's warning hiss sent Cameron
into the brush to allow an Indian to scout his back trail.It was clear
that the presence of Cameron and the half-breed upon the Ghost River
trail had awakened the suspicion in Copperhead's mind that the plan to
hold a powwow at Manitou Rock was known to the Police and that they were
on his trail.It became therefore increasingly evident to Cameron that
any plan that involved the possibility of taking Copperhead unawares
would have to be abandoned."Jerry," he said, "if that Indian doubles back on his track again I mean
to get him.If we get him the other chaps will follow."Give heem to me," said Jerry eagerly.It was toward the close of the afternoon when again Jerry's hiss warned
Cameron that the Indian was returning upon his trail.Cameron stepped
into the brush at the side, and, crouching low, prepared for the
encounter, but as he was about to spring Jerry flashed past him, and,
hurling himself upon the Indian's back, gripped him by the throat and
bore him choking to earth, knocking the wind out of him and rendering
him powerless.Jerry's knife descended once bright, once red, and the
Indian with a horrible gasping cry lay still.cried Cameron, seizing the dead man by the shoulders.Jerry sprang to seize the legs, and, taking care not to break down the
brush on either side of the trail, they lifted the body into the thick
underwood and concealing themselves beside it awaited events.Hardly
were they out of sight when they heard the soft pad of several feet
running down the trail.grunted the Indian runner, and darted back by the way he had
come.With every nerve strung to its highest tension they waited, crouching,
Jerry tingling and quivering with the intensity of his excitement,
Cameron quiet, cool, as if assured of the issue."I am going to get that devil this time, Jerry," he breathed."He
dragged me by the neck once.At a little distance from them there
was a sound of creeping steps.A few moments they waited and at their
side the brush began to quiver.A moment later beside Cameron's face
a hand carrying a rifle parted the screen of spruce boughs.Quick as
a flash Cameron seized the wrist, gripping it with both hands, and,
putting his weight into the swing, flung himself backwards; at the same
time catching the body with his knee, he heaved it clear over their
heads and landed it hard against a tree.The rifle tumbled from the
Indian's hand and he lay squirming on the ground.Immediately as Jerry
sprang for the rifle a second Indian thrust his face through the screen,
caught sight of Jerry with the rifle, darted back and disappeared with
Jerry hard upon his trail.Scarcely had they vanished into the brush
when Cameron, hearing a slight sound at his back, turned swiftly to
see a tall Indian charging upon him with knife raised to strike.He had
barely time to thrust up his arm and divert the blow from his neck to
his shoulder when the Indian was upon him like a wild cat.cried Cameron with exultation, as he flung him off.The Sioux paused in his attack, looking scornfully at his antagonist.He was dressed in a highly embroidered tight-fitting deerskin coat and
leggings.he grunted in a voice of quiet, concentrated fury."No, Copperhead," replied Cameron quietly."You have a knife, I have
none, but I shall lead you like a dog into the Police guard-house."The Sioux said nothing in reply, but kept circling lightly on his toes
waiting his chance to spring.As the two men stood facing each other
there was little to choose between them in physical strength and agility
as well as in intelligent fighting qualities.There was this difference,
however, that the Indian's fighting had ever been to kill, the white
man's simply to win.But this difference to-day had ceased to exist.There was in Cameron's mind the determination to kill if need be.One
immense advantage the Indian held in that he possessed a weapon in
the use of which he was a master and by means of which he had already
inflicted a serious wound upon his enemy, a wound which as yet was but
slightly felt.To deprive the Indian of that knife was Cameron's first
aim.That once achieved, the end could not long be delayed; for the
Indian, though a skillful wrestler, knows little of the art of fighting
with his hands.As Cameron stood on guard watching his enemy's movements, his mind
recalled in swift review the various wrongs he had suffered at his
hands, the fright and insult to his wife, the devastation of his home,
the cattle-raid involving the death of Raven, and lastly he remembered
with a deep rage his recent humiliation at the Indian's hands and how
he had been hauled along by the neck and led like a dog into the Indian
camp.At these recollections he became conscious of a burning desire to
humiliate the redskin who had dared to do these things to him.With this in mind he waited the Indian's attack.The attack came swift
as a serpent's dart, a feint to strike, a swift recoil, then like
a flash of light a hard drive with the knife.But quick as was the
Indian's drive Cameron was quicker.Catching the knife-hand at the wrist
he drew it sharply down, meeting at the same time the Indian's chin with
a short, hard uppercut that jarred his head so seriously that his grip
on the knife relaxed and it fell from his hand.Cameron kicked it behind
him into the brush while the Indian, with a mighty wrench, released
himself from Cameron's grip and sprang back free.For some time the
Indian kept away out of Cameron's reach as if uncertain of himself.I
will punish the great Sioux Chief like a little child."So saying, Cameron stepped quickly toward him, made a few passes and
once, twice, with his open hand slapped the Indian's face hard.In a mad
fury of passion the Indian rushed upon him.Cameron met him with blows,
one, two, three, the last one heavy enough to lay him on the ground
insensible.said Cameron contemptuously, kicking him as he might a
dog.Slowly the Indian rose, wiping his bleeding lips, hate burning in his
eyes, but in them also a new look, one of fear.smiled Cameron, enjoying to the full
the humiliation of his enemy.He was no coward and he was
by no means beaten as yet, but this kind of fighting was new to him.He
apparently determined to avoid those hammering fists of the white man.With extraordinary agility he kept out of Cameron's reach, circling
about him and dodging in and out among the trees.While thus pressing
hard upon the Sioux Cameron suddenly became conscious of a sensation
of weakness.The bloodletting of the knife wound was beginning to tell.Cameron began to dread that if ever this Indian made up his mind to run
away he might yet escape.He began to regret his trifling with him and
he resolved to end the fight as soon as possible with a knock-out blow.The quick eye of the Indian perceived that Cameron's breath was coming
quicker, and, still keeping carefully out of his enemy's reach, he
danced about more swiftly than ever.Cameron realized that he must bring
the matter quickly to an end.Feigning a weakness greater than he felt,
he induced the Indian to run in upon him, but this time the Indian
avoided the smashing blow with which Cameron met him, and, locking his
arms about his antagonist and gripping him by the wounded shoulder,
began steadily to wear him to the ground.Sickened by the intensity
of the pain in his wounded shoulder, Cameron felt his strength rapidly
leaving him.Gradually the Indian shifted his hand up from the shoulder
to the neck, the fingers working their way toward Cameron's face.Well
did Cameron know the savage trick which the Indian had in mind.In a
few minutes more those fingers would be in Cameron's eyes pressing the
eyeballs from their sockets.It was now the Indian's turn to jibe.The taunt served to stimulate every ounce of Cameron's remaining
strength.With a mighty effort he wrenched the Indian's hand from his
face, and, tearing himself free, swung his clenched fist with all his
weight upon the Indian's neck.The blow struck just beneath the jugular
vein.The Indian's grip relaxed, he staggered back a pace, half stunned.Summoning all his force, Cameron followed up with one straight blow upon
the chin.As if stricken by an axe the Indian
fell to the earth and lay as if dead.Sinking on the ground beside him
Cameron exerted all his will-power to keep himself from fainting.After
a few minutes' fierce struggle with himself he was sufficiently revived
to be able to bind the Indian's hands behind his back with his belt.Searching among the brushwood, he found the Indian's knife, and cut from
his leather trousers sufficient thongs to bind his legs, working with
fierce and concentrated energy while his strength lasted.At length as
the hands were drawn tight darkness fell upon his eyes and he sank down
unconscious beside his foe.He has lost a lot of blood, but we have checked
that flow and he will soon be right.We know the
old snake and we have tied him fast.Jerry has a fine assortment of
knots adorning his person.Now, no more talking for half a day.A mighty close shave it was, but by to-morrow you
will be fairly fit.Looks
as if a tree had fallen upon him."Martin's
Cameron could only make feeble answer, "For God's sake don't let him
go!"After the capture of Copperhead the camp at Manitou Lake faded away, for
when the Police Patrol under Jerry's guidance rode up the Ghost River
Trail they found only the cold ashes of camp-fires and the debris that
remains after a powwow.Three days later Cameron rode back into Fort Calgary, sore but content,
for at his stirrup and bound to his saddle-horn rode the Sioux Chief,
proud, untamed, but a prisoner.As he rode into the little town his
quick eyes flashed scorn upon all the curious gazers, but in their
depths beneath the scorn there looked forth an agony that only Cameron
saw and understood.He had played for a great stake and had lost.As the patrol rode into Fort Calgary the little town was in an uproar of
jubilation.inquired the doctor, for Cameron felt too weary to
inquire.said a young chap dressed in cow-boy
garb."Middleton has smashed the half-breeds at Batoche.Cameron threw a swift glance at the Sioux's face.A fierce anxiety
looked out of the gleaming eyes."Tell him, Jerry," said Cameron to the half-breed who rode at his other
side.As Jerry told the Indian of the total collapse of the rebellion and the
capture of its leader the stern face grew eloquent with contempt."Riel he much fool--no good
fight.The look on his face all too
clearly revealed that his soul was experiencing the bitterness of death.Cameron almost pitied him, but he spoke no word.There was nothing that
one could say and besides he was far too weary for anything but rest.At the gate of the Barrack yard his old Superintendent from Fort Macleod
met the party.exclaimed the Superintendent, glancing in
alarm at Cameron's wan face."I have got him," replied Cameron, loosing the lariat from the horn of
his saddle and handing the end to an orderly."But," he added, "it seems
hardly worth while now."exclaimed the Superintendent with as much
excitement as he ever allowed to appear in his tone."Let me tell you,
Cameron, that if any one thing has kept me from getting into a blue funk
during these months it was the feeling that you were on patrol along the
Sun Dance Trail."But while he smiled he
looked into the cold, gray eyes of his Chief, and, noting the unwonted
glow in them, he felt that after all his work as the Patrol of the Sun
Dance Trail was perhaps worth while.CHAPTER XXI

WHY THE DOCTOR STAYED


The Big Horn River, fed by July suns burning upon glaciers high up
between the mountain-peaks, was running full to its lips and gleaming
like a broad ribbon of silver, where, after rushing hurriedly out of the
rock-ribbed foothills, it settled down into a deep steady flow through
the wide valley of its own name.On the tawny undulating hillsides,
glorious in the splendid July sun, herds of cattle and horses were
feeding, making with the tawny hillsides and the silver river a picture
of luxurious ease and quiet security that fitted well with the mood of
the two men sitting upon the shady side of the Big Horn Ranch House.Inspector Dickson was enjoying to the full his after-dinner pipe,
and with him Dr.Martin, who was engaged in judiciously pumping
the Inspector in regard to the happenings of the recent
campaign--successfully, too, except where he touched those events in
which the Inspector himself had played a part.Riel
was in his cell at Regina awaiting trial and execution.Pound-maker,
Little Pine, Big Bear and some of their other Chiefs were similarly
disposed of.Copperhead at Macleod was fretting his life out like an
eagle in a cage.The various regiments of citizen soldiers had gone back
to their homes to be received with vociferous welcome, except such of
them as were received in reverent silence, to be laid away among the
immortals with quiet falling tears.The Police were busily engaged in
wiping up the debris of the Rebellion.The Commissioner, intent upon his
duty, was riding the marches, bearing in grim silence the criticism of
empty-headed and omniscient scribblers, because, forsooth, he had
obeyed his Chief's orders, and, resisting the greatest provocation to
do otherwise, had held steadfastly to his post, guarding with resolute
courage what was committed to his trust.The Superintendents and
Inspectors were back at their various posts, settling upon the reserves
wandering bands of Indians, some of whom were just awakening to the
fact that they had missed a great opportunity and were grudgingly
surrendering to the inevitable, and, under the wise, firm, judicious
handling of the Police, were slowly returning to their pre-rebellion
status.The Western ranches were rejoicing in a sense of vast relief from the
terrible pall that like a death-cloud had been hanging over them for six
months and all Western Canada was thrilling with the expectation of a
new era of prosperity consequent upon its being discovered by the big
world outside.Cameron, carrying in her arms her
babe, bore down in magnificent and modest pride, wearing with matronly
grace her new glory of a great achievement, the greatest open to
womankind."He has just waked up from a very fine sleep," she exclaimed, "to make
your acquaintance, Inspector.I hope you duly appreciate the honor done
you."The Inspector rose to his feet and saluted the new arrival with becoming
respect.Cameron, settling herself down with an air of
determined resolve, "I want to hear all about it.""Meaning, to begin with, that famous march of yours from Calgary to the
far North land where you did so many heroic things."But the Inspector's talk had a trick of fading away at the end of
the third sentence and it was with difficulty that they could get him
started again.Cameron, giving up the
struggle.The latter turned upon the Inspector two steady blue eyes beaming with
the intelligence of a two months' experience of men and things, and
announced his grave disapproval of the Inspector's conduct in a distinct
"goo!"What have
you now to say for yourself?"The Inspector regarded the blue-eyed atom with reverent wonder."Most remarkable young person I ever saw in my life, Mrs."Well, baby, he IS provoking, but we will forgive him since he is so
clever at discovering your remarkable qualities."Martin," explained the mother with affectionate emphasis,
"what a way you have of putting things."He promised faithfully to be home before
dinner."She rose, and, going to the side of the house, looked long and
anxiously up toward the foothills.Martin followed her and stood at
her side gazing in the same direction."I never tire of looking over
the hills and up to the great mountains.""What the deuce is the fellow doing?"exclaimed the doctor, disgust and
rage mingling in his tone.she cried, her eyes following the
doctor's and lighting upon two figures that stood at the side of the
poplar bluff in an attitude sufficiently compromising to justify the
doctor's exclamation.It's Moira--and--and--it's Smith!The
doctor's language appeared unequal to his emotions.he cried,
after an exhausting interlude of expletives.Oh, I don't
know--and I don't care.I gave her up to that other fellow who saved her life
and then picturesquely got himself killed.Raven was a fine chap and I don't mind her losing her heart to
him--but really this is too much.I don't care what kind of
legs he has.Smith is an honorable fellow and--and--so good he was to
us.Why, when Allan and the rest of you were all away he was like a
brother through all those terrible days.I can never forget his splendid
kindness--but--"

"I beg your pardon, Mrs.I am an ass, a jealous ass--might as well own it.But,
really, I cannot quite stand seeing her throw herself at Smith--Smith!Oh, I know, I know, he is all right.But oh--well--at any rate thank
God I saw him at it.It will keep me from openly and uselessly abasing
myself to her and making a fool of myself generally.Martin," at length she groaned tearfully, "I am
so disappointed.I was so hoping, and I was sure it was all
right--and--and--oh, what does it mean?Martin, I cannot tell
you how I feel."A little
surgical operation in the region of the pericardium is all, that is
required."Cameron, vaguely listening
to him and busy with her own thoughts the while.I am talking about that organ,
the central organ of the vascular system of animals, a hollow muscular
structure that propels the blood by alternate contractions and
dilatations, which in the mammalian embryo first appears as two tubes
lying under the head and immediately behind the first visceral arches,
but gradually moves back and becomes lodged in the thorax."Cameron, waking up as from a dream."I am going, and I am going to leave this country," said the doctor.I have thought of it for
some time, and now I will go.""Well, you must wait at least till Allan returns.You must say good-by
to him."She followed the doctor anxiously back to his seat beside the
Inspector."Here," she cried, "hold baby a minute.There are some things
I must attend to.I would give him to the Inspector, but he would not
know how to handle him.""But I tell you I must get home," said the doctor in helpless wrath.You are not holding him
properly.Mean
advantage to take of the young person."The doctor glowered at the Inspector and set himself with ready skill to
remedy the wrong he had wrought in the young person's disposition while
the mother, busying herself ostentatiously with her domestic duties,
finally disappeared around the house, making for the bluff.As soon as
she was out of earshot she raised her voice in song."I must give the fools warning, I suppose," she said to herself.In the
pauses of her singing, "Oh, what does she mean?Well, Smith is all right, but--oh, I
must talk to her.And yet, I am so angry--yes, I am disgusted.I was
so sure that everything was all right.Ah, there she is at last,
and--well--thank goodness he is gone."Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!""Now, I must keep my temper," she added
to herself.Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!""Oh-h-h-h-O!"I am so sorry I forgot all about the tea.""So I should suppose," snapped Mandy crossly."I saw you were too deeply
engaged to think."exclaimed the girl, a startled dismay in her face."Yes, and I would suggest that you select a less conspicuous stage for
your next scene.If it had been Raven,
Moira, I could have stood it."Her voice was hushed and
there was a look of pain in her eyes."Oh, there is nothing wrong with Smith," replied her sister-in-law
crossly, "but--well--kissing him, you know."I did not--"

"It looked to me uncommonly like it at any rate," said Mandy."You
surely don't deny that you were kissing him?"I mean, it was Smith--perhaps--yes, I think Smith did--"

"Well, it was a silly thing to do.""That's just it," said Mandy indignantly."Well, that is my affair," said Moira in an angry tone, and with a high
head and lofty air she appeared in the doctor's presence.Martin was apparently oblivious of both her lofty air and the
angle of her chin.He was struggling to suppress from observation a
tumult of mingled passions of jealousy, rage and humiliation.That this
girl whom for four years he had loved with the full strength of his
intense nature should have given herself to another was grief enough;
but the fact that this other should have been a man of Smith's caliber
seemed to add insult to his grief.He felt that not only had she
humiliated him but herself as well."If she is the kind of girl that enjoys kissing Smith I don't want her,"
he said to himself savagely, and then cursed himself that he knew it was
a lie.For no matter how she should affront him or humiliate herself
he well knew he should take her gladly on his bended knees from Smith's
hands.The cure somehow was not working, but he would allow no one to
suspect it.His voice was even and his manner cheerful as ever.Cameron, who held the key to his heart, suspected the agony through
which he was passing during the tea-hour.And it was to secure respite
for him that the tea was hurried and the doctor packed off to saddle
Pepper and round up the cows for the milking.Pepper was by birth and breeding a cow-horse, and once set upon a trail
after a bunch of cows he could be trusted to round them up with little
or no aid from his rider.Hence once astride Pepper and Pepper with his
nose pointed toward the ranging cows, the doctor could allow his heart
to roam at will.And like a homing pigeon, his heart, after some faint
struggles in the grip of its owner's will, made swift flight toward the
far-away Highland glen across the sea, the Cuagh Oir.With deliberate purpose he set himself to live again the tender and
ineffaceable memories of that eventful visit to the glen when first his
eyes were filled with the vision of the girl with the sunny hair and the
sunny eyes who that day seemed to fill the very glen and ever since that
day his heart with glory.With deliberate purpose, too, he set himself to recall the glen itself,
its lights and shadows, its purple hilltops, its emerald loch far down
at the bottom, the little clachan on the hillside and up above it the
old manor-house.But ever and again his heart would pause to catch anew
some flitting glance of the brown eyes, some turn of the golden head,
some cadence of the soft Highland voice, some fitful illusive sweetness
of the smile upon the curving lips, pause and return upon its tracks to
feel anew that subtle rapture of the first poignant thrill, lingering
over each separate memory as a drunkard lingers regretful over his last
sweet drops of wine.Meantime Pepper's intelligent diligence had sent every cow home to its
milking, and so, making his way by a short cut that led along the Big
Horn River and round the poplar bluff, the doctor, suddenly waking from
his dream of the past, faced with a fresh and sharper stab the reality
of the present.The suddenness and sharpness of the pain made him pull
his horse up short."I'll cut this country and go East," he said aloud, coming to a
conclusive decision upon a plan long considered, "I'll go in for
specializing.He sat his horse looking eastward over the hills that rolled far away to
the horizon.His eye wandered down the river gleaming now like gold in
the sunset glow.He had learned to love this land of great sunlit spaces
and fresh blowing winds, but this evening its very beauty appeared
intolerable to him.Ever since the death of Raven upon that tragic
night of the cattle-raid he had been fighting his bitter loss and
disappointment; with indifferent success, it is true, but still not
without the hope of attaining final peace of soul.This evening he knew
that, while he lived in this land, peace would never come to him, for
his heart-wound never would heal."I will say good-by to-night.Pepper woke up to some purpose and at a smart canter carried the doctor
on his way round the bluff toward a gate that opened into a lane leading
to the stables.At the gate a figure started up suddenly from the shadow
of a poplar.With a snort and in the midst of his stride Pepper swung on
his heels with such amazing abruptness that his rider was flung from his
saddle, fortunately upon his feet."Confound you for a dumb-headed fool!he
cried in a sudden rage, recognizing Smith, who stood beside the trail in
an abjectly apologetic attitude."Yes," cried another voice from the shadow.You would
think he ought to know Mr.The doctor stood speechless, surprise, disgust and rage struggling for
supremacy among his emotions.He stood gazing stupidly from one to the
other, utterly at a loss for words.Smith," began Moira somewhat lamely, "had something to say
to me and so we--and so we came--along to the gate.""So I see," replied the doctor gruffly.Smith has come to mean a great deal to me--to us--"

"So I should imagine," replied the doctor."His self-sacrifice and courage during those terrible days we can never
forget.""Exactly so--quite right," replied the doctor, standing stiffly beside
his horse's head."You do not know people all at once," continued Moira."But in times of danger and trouble one gets to know them quickly.""And it takes times of danger to bring out the hero in a man.""I should imagine so," replied the doctor with his eyes on Smith's
childlike and beaming face.Smith was really our whole stay, and--and--we came
to rely upon him and we found him so steadfast."In the face of the
doctor's stolid brevity Moira was finding conversation difficult."Exactly so," his eyes upon Smith's
wobbly legs.I congratulate
him on--"

"Oh, have you heard?I did not know that--"

"Yes.Yes--that is, for him," replied the doctor without emotion."I congratulate--"

"But how did you hear?""I did not exactly hear, but I had no difficulty in--ah--making the
discovery."It was fairly plain; I might say it was the feature of
the view; in fact it stuck right out of the landscape--hit you in the
eye, so to speak."Simply that I am at a loss as to whether Mr.Smith is to be
congratulated more upon his exquisite taste or upon his extraordinary
good fortune.""Good fortune, yes, is it not splendid?""Splendid is the exact word," said the doctor stiffly."Yes, you certainly look happy," replied the doctor with a grim attempt
at a smile, and feeling as if more enthusiasm were demanded from him."Let me offer you my congratulations and say good-by.I have thought of it for some time; indeed, I
have made my plans."But you never hinted such
a thing to--to any of us.""Oh, well, I don't tell my plans to all the world," said the doctor with
a careless laugh.The girl shrank from him as if he had cut her with his riding whip.But,
swiftly recovering herself, she cried with gay reproach:

"Why, Mr.Smith, we are losing all our friends at once.Smith, you
know," she continued, turning to the doctor with an air of exaggerated
vivacity, "leaves for the East to-night too.""Yes, you know he has come into a big fortune and is going to be--"

"A fortune?""Yes, and he is going East to be married.""Yes, and I was--"

"Going EAST?"I thought
you--"

"Oh, yes, his young lady is awaiting him in the East.And he is going to
spend his money in such a splendid way."echoed the doctor, as if he could not fix the idea with
sufficient firmness in his brain to grasp it fully."Yes, I have just told you so," replied the girl.shouted the doctor, suddenly rushing at Smith and gripping
him by both arms."Smith, you shy dog--you lucky dog!Let me wish you
joy, old man.You deserve your luck, every bit of it.Smith, you are a good one and a sly
one.What a sell--I mean what a
joke!Look here, Smith, old chap, would you mind taking Pepper home?I am rather tired--riding, I mean--beastly wild cows--no end of a run
after them.No, no, don't wait, don't
mind me.I am all right, fit as a fiddle--no, not a bit tired--I mean I
am tired riding.Yes, rather stiff--about the knees, you know.Up you get, old man--there you are!So, Smith, you are going
to be married, eh?Tell 'em I am--tell 'em we are coming.Oh, well, never mind my horse till I come myself.Say, let's
sit down, Moira," he said, suddenly growing quiet and turning to the
girl, "till I get my wind.Legs a bit wobbly, but
don't care if he had a hundred of 'em and all wobbly.What an adjectival, hyphenated jackass!Don't
look at me that way or I shall climb a tree and yell.I'm not mad, I
assure you.I was on the verge of it a few moments ago, but it is gone.I am sane, sane as an old maid.He covered his face with
his hands and sat utterly still for some moments."Why, Moira, I thought you were going to marry that idiot."I am
not going to marry him, Dr.Martin, but he is an honorable fellow and a
friend of mine, a dear friend of mine.""So he is, so he is, a splendid fellow, the finest ever, but thank God
you are not going to marry him!""Why, what is wrong with--"

"Why?Only because, Moira, I love you."He threw
himself upon his knees beside her."Don't, don't for God's sake get
away!Ever since that minute when I saw you in the glen I have loved you.In
my thoughts by day and in my dreams by night you have been, and this day
when I thought I had lost you I knew that I loved you ten thousand times
more than ever."He was kissing her hand passionately, while she sat
with head turned away."Tell me, Moira, if I may love you?And do you think you could love me even a little bit?He waited a few
moments, his face growing gray."Tell me," he said at length in a
broken, husky voice.he cried, putting his arms around her and drawing her to
him, "tell me to stay.""Stay," she whispered, "or take me too."The sun had long since disappeared behind the big purple mountains
and even the warm afterglow in the eastern sky had faded into a pearly
opalescent gray when the two reached the edge of the bluff nearest the
house.cried Moira aghast, as she came in sight of the
house.I was going to help," exclaimed the doctor."Too bad," said the girl penitently."But, of course, there's Smith."Let us go in
and face the music."They found an excited group standing in the kitchen, Mandy with a letter
in her hand."Where have you--" She glanced at
Moira's face and then at the doctor's and stopped abruptly."We have got a letter--such a letter!"The doctor cleared
his throat, struck an attitude, and read aloud:


"My dear Cameron:

"It gives me great pleasure to say for the officers of the Police Force
in the South West district and for myself that we greatly appreciate the
distinguished services you rendered during the past six months in your
patrol of the Sun Dance Trail.It was a work of difficulty and danger
and one of the highest importance to the country.I feel sure it will
gratify you to know that the attention of the Government has been
specially called to the creditable manner in which you have performed
your duty, and I have no doubt that the Government will suitably express
its appreciation of your services in due time.But, as you are aware,
in the Force to which we have the honor to belong, we do not look for
recognition, preferring to find a sufficient reward in duty done."Permit me also to say that we recognize and appreciate the spirit
of devotion showed by Mrs.Cameron during these trying months in so
cheerfully and loyally giving you up to this service."May I add that in this rebellion to my mind the most critical factor
was the attitude of the great Blackfeet Confederacy.Every possible
effort was made by the half-breeds and Northern Indians to seduce
Crowfoot and his people from their loyalty, and their most able and
unscrupulous agent in this attempt was the Sioux Indian known among
us as The Copperhead.That he failed utterly in his schemes and that
Crowfoot remained loyal I believe is due to the splendid work of the
officers and members of our Force in the South West district, but
especially to your splendid services as the Patrol of the Sun Dance
Trail.""And signed by the big Chief himself, the Commissioner," cried Dr."What do you think of that, Baby?"he continued, catching the
baby from its mother's arms.The
doctor pirouetted round the room with the baby in his arms, that
young person regarding the whole performance apparently with grave and
profound satisfaction."Your horse is ready," said Smith, coming in at the door."Oh--I forgot," said the doctor."Ah--I don't think I want him to-night,
Smith.""You are not going to-night, then?"inquired Mandy in delighted
surprise."No--I--in fact, I believe I have changed my mind about that.I have,
been--ah--persuaded to remain.""Oh, I see," cried Mandy in supreme delight.Then turning swiftly upon
her sister-in-law who stood beside the doctor, her face in a radiant
glow, she added, "Then what did you mean by--by--what we saw this
afternoon?""Going to be married, you know," interjected the doctor."And so--so--"

"Just so," cried the doctor."Smith's all right, I say,
and so are we, eh, Moira?"He slipped his arm round the blushing girl."Oh, I am so glad," cried Mandy, beaming upon them."And you are not
going East after all?"I am going to stay right in it--with the
Inspector here--and with you, Mrs.Cameron--and with my sweetheart--and
yes, certainly with the Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail."I am tormented because of my condition, because of
Avicia's misery.Is it really true that you came
upon us by chance in the woods?'"'I have not seen Kristel since you and I last met.'"He took the hand I held out to him, and we followed Avicia into the
inn, where, very soon, we were seated at a table with a modest meal
before us.The food was poor enough, the wine was thin and common, but
we could scarcely have enjoyed a grand banquet more.I speak not alone
for myself, but for Silvain and Avicia; it was evident to me that they
had not had many full meals lately.Avicia especially ate ravenously,
and with a perfect sense of animal enjoyment, and it was only when she
had finished that a certain terror, which I had observed in both her
and Silvain, again asserted itself."'Remain here a while, Avicia,' said Silvain, at the end of the meal;
'I wish to speak to our friend alone.'"She was seated on a hard bench, not conducive to repose; nevertheless
she closed her eyes, and was almost immediately asleep.said Silvain, with a sigh,'she has suffered much--and
in a few weeks will become a mother.'"We strolled up and down outside the inn and conversed."'You have behaved to us with true friendship,' he said; 'and yet you
can see we are beggars."I am not rich,' I replied, 'but I can spare to a friend.'"'We are making our way to Avicia's home, to the lighthouse upon which
I saw her for the first time otherwise than in my dreams.I doubt
whether you can turn aside the finger of Fate as I behold it, pointing
downwards to a grave, but you can perhaps help us to cheat it for a
short time.'"'You speak strangely, Silvain; the ominous fears which oppress you
may be bred by a disordered fancy.'"'In our former intercourse,' was his reply, 'was my fancy ever
disordered?I advanced nothing that was not afterwards proved; I made
no pretence of accounting for the warnings I received; I make none
now.I shudder to think of the future, not so much for my own sake as
for Avicia's.Helpless, penniless, without a friend----'

"'You are forgetting me, Silvain?'"'Ah, yes, my friend, as you still declare yourself to be; I cannot
but believe you.But Avicia----'

"'I am her friend as well as yours.'"'For God's sake, do not speak lightly!You do not know to what a pass
I am driven.'"'You shall enlighten me, and I maybe able to counsel you.Do not
think I am speaking lightly, As I am your friend, so am I Avicia's.As
I will stand by you, so will I stand by her.'"It was the first time he had uttered my name, and I held it as a sign
that I had dispelled his distrust.I replied, 'In perfect faith,
Silvain.'When I am gone, she will not be quite alone in the
world.And now, will you give me a little money?I do not ask you to
lend it to me, for I have no expectation of being able to repay you.I
will briefly explain the necessity for it.It is our only refuge, and there our child will be born.We have fifty miles to go, and
Avicia is not strong enough to walk----'

"'Say no more,' I interrupted, 'of the necessity for such a trifle; I
can spare you more than sufficient for your purpose.'"I took from my purse what was requisite for my immediate needs, and
pressed the purse with the coins that remained into his hand.He took
it in silence, and his emaciated form shook with gratitude."'You ask no questions about these,' he said, pointing to his rags.'But there are one or two points
upon which you might satisfy me.'"'I cannot go into my history, Louis.If you will give me your address
I will send it to you before the week is out.Indeed, after your noble
promise with respect to Avicia, it is yours by right.It will not only
enlighten, it will guide you.'"'I will wait for it, and will make an opportunity of seeing you soon
after I have read it.The points I wish to mention are these: While
you and Avicia were sleeping in the forest, and I stood looking down
upon you, you cried--not because of my presence, of which you were
ignorant, but because of some disturbing dream--"He is coming
nearer--nearer!I know it through my dreams, as of old.You
could not doubt their truth when we travelled together--ah, those
happy days!--you cannot doubt it now.'"'Then, what was love between you has turned to hate?'The words
escaped me unaware; I repented of them the moment they were spoken."'Yes,' said Silvain, in a tone of deepest sadness, 'what was love
between us is turned to hate.The babe that Avicia will soon press to her breast will be our
first-born.'"To matters upon which I saw he was then unwilling to converse, I made
no further reference.He engaged a light cart and horse, and a man to
drive them to the village by the sea.Then he woke Avicia, and I said
farewell to them, and gazed after them till they were out of sight."As he had promised, I received from him before the end of the week a
statement of his adventures.It is now among my papers in Nerac, and I
remember perfectly all the salient particulars necessary to my story,
which is now drawing to a conclusion.I will narrate them in my own
way, asking you to recall the day upon which the brothers were last
seen in the village by the sea.""Silvain, Kristel, and Avicia, accompanied by her father, rowed from
the lighthouse to the shore.The villagers saw but little of them;
they passed out of the village, and Avicia's father returned alone to
the lighthouse.Kristel loved Avicia with all the passion of a hot,
imperious, and intense nature.He looked upon her as his, and had he
suspected that Silvain would have fallen in love with her, it can
readily be understood that he would have been the last man to bring
them into association with each other."When Kristel and Avicia met in the Tyrol, Kristel was buoyed up with
hopes that she reciprocated the love she had inspired in his breast.He had some reason for this hope, for at his request, when he asked
her to become his wife and said that he could not marry without his
father's consent, she had written home to _her_ father with respect to
the young gentleman's proposal, thereby leading him to believe that
she was ready to accept him.It appeared, however, that there was no
real depth in her feelings for him; and, indeed, it may be pardoned
her if she supposed that his fervid protestations were prompted by
feelings as light and as little genuine as her own.Unsophisticated as
she was in the ways of the world, the fact of his making the
honourable accomplishment of his love for her dependent upon the fiat
of another person could not but have lessened the value of his
declarations--more especially when she had not truly given him her
heart.It was given to Silvain upon the occasion of their first
meeting, and it was not long before they found the opportunity to
exchange vows of affection--a circumstance of which I and every person
but themselves were entirely ignorant."It was because of Avicia's fear of her father that this love was kept
secret; he held her completely in control, and--first favouring
Kristel and then Silvain, playing them against each other, as it were,
to his own advantage in the way of gifts--filled her with
apprehension."'Looking back,' Silvain said in his statement to me, 'upon the
history of those days of happiness and torture, I can see now that I
was wrong in not endeavouring to arrive at a frank understanding with
my brother; but indeed I had but one thought--Avicia.As Kristel
believed her to be his, so did I believe her to be mine, and the idea
of losing her was sufficient to make my life a life of despair.And
after all, it was for Avicia to decide.Absorbing as was my love for
her, I should have had no choice but to retire and pass my days in
misery had she decided in favour of Kristel.'"The base conduct of Avicia's father was to a great extent the cause
of turning brotherly love to hate.Seeing their infatuation, he
bargained with each secretly, saying, in effect, 'What will you give
me if I give you my daughter's hand?--for she will not, and cannot,
marry without my consent.'"And to the other, 'What will _you_ give me?'"He bound them to secrecy by a solemn oath, and bound his daughter
also in like manner, promising that she should have the one she loved.Silvain was the more liberal of the two, and signed papers, pledging
himself to pay to the avaricious father a large sum of money within a
certain time after his union with Avicia.So cunningly did the keeper
of the lighthouse conduct these base negotiations, that, even on that
last day when they all rowed together to the village, neither of the
brothers knew that matters were to be brought then and there to an
irrevocable end."The village by the sea lay behind them some six or eight miles.Then,
upon a false pretext, Avicia's father got rid of Kristel, sending him
on an errand for Avicia which would render necessary an absence of
many hours.That done, he said to Silvain and Avicia, 'Everything is
arranged.asked Silvain, his heart throbbing with joy."'Yes, he knows,' replied Avicia's father, 'but, as you are aware, he
had a sneaking regard himself for my daughter, and he thought he would
feel more comfortable, and you and Avicia too, if he were not present
at the ceremony."Satisfied with this--being, indeed, naturally only too willing to be
satisfied--the marriage ceremony took place, and Silvain and Avicia
became man and wife.They departed on their honeymoon, and instructed
the keeper of the lighthouse to inform Kristel of their route, in
order that he might be able to join them at any point he pleased."Then came the interview between Avicia's father and Kristel, in which
the young man was informed that he had lost Avicia.Kristel was
dismayed and furious at what he believed to be the blackest treachery
on the part of his brother.He swore to be revenged, and asked the
road they had taken.Avicia's father sent him off in an entirely
opposite direction, and he set out in pursuit.Needless to say that he
soon found out how he had been tricked, and that it infuriated him the
more.Not knowing where else to write to Silvain, he addressed a
letter to him at their home in Germany; he himself did not proceed
thither, judging that his best chance of meeting the married couple
lay near the village by the sea, to which he felt convinced Silvain
and Avicia would soon return.Therefore he lurked in the vicinity of
the village, and watched by day and night the principal avenues by
which it was to be approached.But his judgment was at fault; they did
not return."In the meantime the lovers were enjoying their honeymoon.In order to
keep faith with Avicia's father in the bargain made between him and
Silvain--which rendered necessary the payment of a substantial sum of
money by a given time--it was imperative that Silvain should visit his
boyhood's home, to obtain his share of the inheritance left to him and
Kristel by their father.The happy couple dallied by the way, and it
was not until three months after their marriage that they arrived at
Silvain's birthplace."'Perhaps we shall meet Kristel there,' said Silvain."Instead of meeting his brother, Silvain received the letter which
Kristel had written to him.It breathed the deepest hate, and Silvain
had the unhappiness of reading the outpourings of a relentless,
vindictive spirit, driven to despair by disappointed love."'You have robbed me,' the letter said; 'hour by hour, day by day,
have you set yourself deliberately to ensnare me and to fill my life
with black despair.Had I suspected it at the time I would have
strangled you.But your fate is only postponed; revenge is mine, and I
hold it in my soul as a sacred trust which I shall fulfil.Never in this world or in the next will I forgive
you!My relentless hate shall haunt and pursue you, and you shall not
escape it!'"And then the writer recorded an awful oath that, while life remained
within him, his one sole aim should be to compass his revenge.It was
a lengthy letter, and strong as is my description of it, it falls
short of the intense malignity which pervaded every line.Kristel
launched a curse so terrible against his brother that Silvain's hair
rose up in horror and fear as he read it.These are Silvain's own
words to me:

"'After reading Kristel's letter,' he said, 'I felt that I was
accursed, and that it was destined that he should kill me.'"How to escape the terrible doom--though he had scarcely a hope of
averting it--how to prevent the crime of blood-guiltiness lying upon
Kristel's soul: this was thereafter the object of Silvain's life.It
afforded him no consolation to know that for the intense hate with
which Kristel's heart was filled Avicia's father was partly
responsible."In its delineation of the trickery by which Kristel had been robbed
of Avicia the letter was not truthful, for there had occurred between
the brothers a conversation in which Silvain had revealed his love for
her.Kristel's over-wrought feelings probably caused him to forget
this--or it may have been a perversion of fact adopted to give
sanction to hate."Kristel's letter was not the only despairing greeting which awaited
Silvain in the home of his boyhood.By some unhappy means the
inheritance left by his father had melted away, and he found himself a
beggar.Thus he was unable to carry out the terms of the bargain
Avicia's father had made with him.This part of his misfortune did not
greatly trouble him; it was but a just punishment to a grasping,
avaricious man; but with beggary staring him in the face, and his
brother's curse and awful design weighing upon him, his situation was
most dreadful and pitiable."It was his intention to keep Kristel's letter from the knowledge of
Avicia, but she secretly obtained possession of it, and it filled her
soul with an agonising fear.They decided that it was impossible to
return to the village by sea."'It is there my brother waits for us,' said Silvain."So from that time they commenced a wandering life, with the one
dominant desire to escape from Kristel."I cannot enter now into a description of the years that followed.They crept from place to place, picking up a precarious existence, and
enduring great privations.One morning Silvain awoke, trembling and
afraid.'I have seen Kristel,' he said."She did not ask him how and under what circumstances he had seen his
brother."'He has discovered that we are here, and is in pursuit of us,'
Silvain continued."This was an added grief to Avicia.The place in which Silvain's dream
of his brother had been dreamt had afforded them shelter and security
for many weeks, and she had begun to indulge in the hope that they
were safe.From
that period, at various times, Silvain was visited by dreams in which
he was made acquainted with Kristel's movements in so far as they
affected him and Avicia and the mission of vengeance upon which
Kristel was relentlessly bent.They made their way to foreign
countries, and even there Kristel pursued them.And so through the
days and years continued the pitiful flight and the merciless pursuit.In darkness they wandered often, the shadow of fate at their heels, in
Avicia's imagination lurking in the solitudes through which they
passed, amidst thickets of trees, in hollows and ravines, waiting,
waiting, waiting to fall upon and destroy them!An appalling life, the
full terrors of which the mind can scarcely grasp."At length, when worldly circumstances pressed so heavily upon them
that they hardly knew where to look for the next day's food, Avicia
whispered to her husband that she expected to become a mother, and
that she was possessed by an inexpressible longing that her child
should be born where she herself first drew breath.After the lapse of
so many years it appeared to Silvain that the lighthouse would be the
likeliest place of safety, and, besides, it was Avicia's earnest wish.They were on the road thither when I chanced upon them in the forest.""After reading Silvain's letter I lost as little time as possible in
paying a visit to the village by the sea.I took with me some presents
for the villagers, who were unaffectedly glad to see me, and not
because of the gifts I brought for them.There I heard what news they
could impart of the history of the lighthouse since I last visited
them.The disappointment with respect to the money he expected from
Silvain had rendered the keeper more savage and morose than ever.For
years after the marriage of his daughter he lived alone on the
lighthouse, but within the last twelve months he had sent for a young
man who was related to him distantly, and who was now looking after
the lights.What kind of comfort the
companionship of a man so afflicted could be in such a home it is
difficult to say, but the new arrival came in good time, for two
months afterwards Avicia's father slipped over some rocks in the
vicinity of the lighthouse, and so injured himself that he could not
rise from his bed.Thus, when Silvain and Avicia presented themselves
he could make no practical resistance to their taking up their abode
with him.However it was, there they were upon my present visit, and I
went at once to see them."They received me with a genuine demonstration of feeling, and I was
pleased to see that they were looking better.Regular food, and the
secure shelter of a roof from which they were not likely to be turned
away at a moment's notice, doubtless contributed to this improvement.The pressure of a dark terror was, however, still visible in their
faces, and during my visit I observed Silvain go to the outer gallery
at least three or four times, and scan the surrounding sea with
anxious eyes.To confirm or dispel the impression I gathered from this
anxious outlook I questioned Silvain."'I am watching for Kristel,' he said."It is scarcely likely he will come to you here,' I said."'He is certain to come to me here,' said Silvain; 'he is now on the
road.'"'Yes, my dreams assure me of it.What wonder that I dream of the
spirit which has been hunting me for years in the person of Kristel.Waking or sleeping, he is ever before me.'"'Should he come, what will you do, Silvain?'"'I hardly know; but at all hazards he must, if possible, be prevented
from effecting an entrance into the lighthouse.It would be the death
of Avicia.'"He pronounced the words 'if possible' with so much emphasis that I
said:

"'Surely that can be prevented.'"'I cannot be on the alert by night as well as by day,' said Silvain.'My dread is that at a time when I am sleeping he will take me
unaware.Avicia is coming up the stairs; do not let her hear us
conversing upon a subject which has been the terror of her life.She
does not know that I am constantly on the watch.'"In this belief he was labouring under a delusion, for Avicia spoke to
me privately about it; she was aware of the anxiety which, she said,
she was afraid was wearing him away; and indeed, as she made this
allusion, and I glanced at Silvain, who was standing in another part
of the lighthouse, I observed what had hitherto escaped me, that his
features were thinner, and that there was a hectic flush upon them
which, in the light of his tragic story, too surely told a tale of an
inward fretting likely to prove fatal.She told me that often in the
night when Silvain was sleeping she would rise softly and go to the
gallery, in fear that Kristel was stealthily approaching them.He gazed at me, and did not speak--not that he was
unable, but because it was part of the cunning of his nature.Silvain
informed me that Avicia expected her baby in three weeks from that
day.I had not come empty-handed, and I left behind me welcome
remembrances, promising to come again the following week.Upon seeing me, a woman of the village ran towards
me, and whispered:

"'Kristel is here.'"I followed the direction of her gaze, which was simply one of
curiosity, and saw a man standing on the beach, facing the lighthouse.I walked straight up to him, and touched him with my hand.He turned,
and I recognised Kristel."I recognised him--yes; but not from any resemblance he bore to the
Kristel of former days.Had I met him under ordinary circumstances I
should not have known him.His thin face was covered with hair; his
eyes were sunken and wild; his bony wrists, his long fingers, seemed
to be fleshless.I spoke to him, and mentioned my name.He heard me,
but did not reply.I begged him to speak, and he remained silent.After his first look at me he turned from me, and stood with his eyes
in the direction of the lighthouse.I would not accept his reception
of me; I continued to address him; I asked him upon what errand he had
come, and why he kept his eyes so fixedly upon the lighthouse.I gave
him information of myself, and said I should be pleased to see him in
my home--with a vague and foolish hope that he would accept the
invitation, and that I might be able to work upon his better nature.I did not dare to utter the name of
either Silvain or Avicia, fearing that I should awake the demon that
had taken possession of his soul."By the time that I had exhausted what I thought it wise and good to
say, I found myself falling into a kind of fascination, produced by
his motionless attitude, and the fixed gaze in his unnaturally
brilliant eyes.It was a bright day, and I knew that my imagination
was playing me a trick, but I saw clearly with my mind's eye, the
outer gallery of the lighthouse, and the figure of Avicia standing
thereon, with her hair hanging loose, and a scarlet covering on her
head.Was it a spiritual reflection of what this silent, motionless
man was gazing upon?I shuddered, and passed my hand across my eyes;
the vision was gone--but he gazed upon it still."I was compelled at length to leave him standing there upon the beach,
and he took no notice of my departure."Others were observing him as well as I, and had watched me with
curiosity during the time I stood by his side.When I was among them
they asked if he had spoken to me."'No,' I replied, 'I could get no word from him.'"'Neither has he spoken to us,' they said.'Not a sound has passed his
lips since his arrival.'"'Yesterday,' they answered, 'and our first thought was that he would
want a boat to row to the lighthouse, but he did not ask for it.Surely he must wish to see his brother!There is something strange
about him, do you not think so?One of our women here insists that he
is dumb.'"'He must be dumb,' said the woman; 'else why should he not speak?'"'There was a jealousy between him and his brother,' said an elderly
woman, 'about Avicia.'exclaimed the woman who pronounced him
dumb.'Jealousy, like love, does not last for ever.She is not the
only woman in the world, and men have eyes.They must have made up
their quarrel long ago.Besides, if he _was_ jealous still, which
isn't in the least likely, that would not make him dumb!His tongue
would be all the looser for it.'"'More terrible,' thought I, 'is the dread silence of that motionless
man than all the storms of wrath his tongue could utter.'"From what the villagers said, I knew that they were in ignorance of
the hatred which filled Kristel's heart, and I debated within myself
what it was best to do.That the simple men of the village would not
voluntarily make themselves parties to any scheme of blind vengeance
on the part of one brother against another I was certain, but I was
not satisfied that it would be right to give them my whole confidence,
and tell them all I knew.At the same time it would not be right to
allow them to remain in complete ignorance, for by so doing they might
be made unwittingly to further Kristel's designs upon his brother's
life.There was a priest in the village, and I went to him, and under
the seal of secrecy revealed something, but not all, of the meaning of
Kristel's appearance."I accompanied him, and once more stood by the side of Kristel.The
priest addressed him, counselled him, exhorted him, and, like myself,
could obtain no word from him.Kindlier speech I never heard, but it
made no impression upon Kristel."'He _must_ be dumb,' said the priest as we moved away."'Not so,' I said earnestly; 'were he dumb, and unable to hear what is
said to him, he would certainly indicate by some kind of sign that
speech addressed to him was falling upon ears that were deaf.He is
possessed by a demoniac obduracy, and his apparent indifference is but
a part of a fell design to which I should be afraid to give a name.'"The priest was impressed by this view of the matter, which could not
but appeal successfully to a man's calm reason.'If a man is determined not to speak, I
have no power to compel him.'"'It is in your power,' I said, 'to prevent bloodshed.'"'Nothing less, I fear,' I said.'Lay an injunction upon the villagers
not to lend that man a boat, and not, under any pretext, to row him to
the lighthouse.'"'I am not at liberty to say more at the present moment,' I said.'I
shall not leave the village to-day.I myself will see that man's
brother, and will obtain permission from him to reveal all I know.Meanwhile give not that soul-tossed wretch the opportunity of carrying
out a scheme of ruthless vengeance which he has harboured for years.'"'Tell me explicitly what you wish me to do.'That man, with the connivance or assistance
of any person in this village, must not be enabled to get to the
lighthouse.'"And he mixed with the villagers, men and women, and laid upon them
the injunction I desired.With my mind thus set at ease for at least a
few hours, I engaged a couple of boatmen to row me to Silvain.I half
expected that Kristel would come forward with a request, made if not
in speech in dumb show, to be allowed to accompany me, and I had
resolved what action to take; but he made no step towards me.He gave
no indication even of a knowledge of what was taking place within a
dozen yards of him, although it was not possible that the putting off
of the boat from the shore could have escaped his observation."'If he is not deaf and dumb,' said one of the rowers, 'he must have
gone clean out of his senses.'"'Neither one nor the other,' thought I; 'he is nursing his vengeance,
and has decided upon some plan of action.'"Silvain and Avicia were on the outer gallery, and when I joined them
Silvain drew me aside."'You have news of Kristel,' he said.I nodded, and he continued: 'I
know without the telling."'No human,' he replied, with a sad smile.'I see him standing upon
the beach, looking towards us.'"In truth that was a physical impossibility, but I needed no further
proof of the mysterious insight with which Silvain was gifted.I
related to him all that had passed between me and Kristel and the
priest, and of the precautions taken to keep from Kristel the means of
reaching the lighthouse."'That will not prevent him from coming, said Silvain; 'he is a fine
swimmer.I myself, were I desperately pushed to it, would undertake to
swim to the village.You hold to your
promise, Louis, with respect to Avicia?'"'It is binding upon me,' I replied;'my word is given.'Neither will my child be left without a counsellor.Louis, I shall never see the face of my child--I shall never feel his
little hands about my neck!'"'Were it not for the tender sympathy I have for you,' I said in a
tone of reproof, 'I should feel inclined to be angry.Did you not
confess to me in former days that you could not see into the future?And here you are, raising up ghosts to make the present more bitter
than it is.Black as things appear, there are bright
years yet in store for you.'"'I cannot help my forebodings, Louis.True, I cannot, nor can any
man, see into the future, but what can I do to turn my brother's hate
from me?'It was a cry of anguish wrung from his suffering heart.'I
think of the days of our childhood, when we strolled in the woods with
our arms round each other's necks, I think of the dreams we mapped of
the future.Running water by the side of which we sat, bending over to
see our faces, and making our lips meet in a shadowed kiss, flowers we
picked in field and meadow, errands of mercy we went upon together,
twilight communings, the little sweethearts we had--all these innocent
ways of childhood rise before me, and fill me with anguish.What can I
do?--what can I do to bring him back to me in brotherly love?Louis, I
have a fear that I have never whispered to living soul.It is that
Avicia may have twin children, as Kristel and I are, and they should
grow up to be as we are now!Would it not be better that they should
be born dead, or die young, when their souls are not stained with
hatred of each other and with evil thoughts that render existence a
curse?'"We were alone when he gave expression to his agonised feelings;
Avicia had left us to attend to domestic duties.I could say nothing
to comfort him; to harp upon one string of intended consolation to a
man who is in no mood to accept it becomes, after a time, an
oppression.He paced up and down, twining his fingers convulsively,
and presently said,

"'It would be too much, Louis, to ask you to remain with me a little
while?'"'No,' I replied, 'it would not.Indeed, it was partly in my mind to
suggest it.The crisis you have dreaded for many years has come, and
if you wish me to stop with you a day or two I will willingly do so.It may be--I do not know how--that I can be of service to you.The
boatmen are waiting in the boat below.I will write a letter to my
wife, and they shall post it, informing her that I shall be absent
from home perhaps until the end of the week, by which time I hope the
cloud will have passed away.No thanks, Silvain; friendship would be a
poor and valueless thing if one shrank from a sacrifice so slight.'"I wrote my letter, and despatched it by the boatmen.Then we waited
for events; it was all that it was in our power to do."Avicia was very glad when she heard of my intention to remain with
them a while."'Your companionship will do him good,' she said.'He has no one but
me to talk to, and he speaks of but one subject.If this continues
long he will lose his reason.'"The day passed, and night came on.There was but scanty living
accommodation in the lighthouse, but a mattress was spread for me upon
the floor of the tiny kitchen; and there I was to sleep.Avicia and
Silvain wished me to occupy their bed, but I would not have it so.Before retiring to rest, Silvain and I passed two or three hours in
converse; I purposely led the conversation into foreign channels, and
when I wished him good-night I was rejoiced to perceive that I had
succeeded for a brief space in diverting his mind from the fears which
weighed so heavily upon him."Nothing occurred during the night to disturb us; I awoke early, and
lay waiting for sunrise; but no light came, and when, aroused by
Silvain, I left my bed and went to the outer gallery, I was surprised
to see that all surrounding space was wrapt in a thick mist."'A great storm will soon be upon us,' said Silvain."He was right; before noon the storm burst, and the sea was lashed
into fury.It was a relief to see the play of lightning upon the angry
waters, but it was terrible too, and I thought how awful and joyless a
lone life must be when spent in such a home.This second day seemed as
if it would never end, and it was only by my watch that I knew of the
approach of night.With the sounds of the storm in my ears I lay down
upon my mattress and fell asleep."I know not at what time of the night I awoke, but with black darkness
upon and around me, I found myself sitting up, listening to sounds
without which did not proceed from the conflict of the elements.At
first I could not decide whether they were real or but the refrain of
a dream by which I had been disturbed; soon, however, I received
indisputable evidence that they were not the creations of my fancy."The voice was Silvain's, and the words were uttered in outer space.When I retired to rest I had lain down in my clothes, removing only my
coat, and using it as a covering.I quickly put it on, and lit a lamp,
to which a chain was attached, by which means it could be held over
the walls of the lighthouse.The lamp was scarcely lighted, when
Avicia, but half dressed, rushed into the little room."Her eyes wandered round the room, seeking him.At that moment the
voice from without pierced the air."I threw my arms round Avicia, and held her fast.'Are you, too, leagued against
us?"It needed all my strength to restrain her from rushing out in her
wild delirium, perhaps to her destruction.I whispered to her
hurriedly that I intended to go to the outer gallery, and that she
should accompany me; and also that if she truly wished to be of
assistance to her husband she must be calm.She ceased instantly to
struggle, and said in a tone of suppressed excitement,

"'Come, then.'"I did not quit my hold of her, but I used now only one hand, which I
clasped firmly round her wrist, my other being required for the
lantern.The next moment we were standing upon the gallery, bending
over.It was pitch dark, and we could see nothing; even the white
spray of the waves, as they dashed against the stone walls, was not
visible to us; but we heard Silvain's voice, at intervals, appealing
in frenzied tones to Kristel, who, it needed not the evidence of sight
to know, was holding on to the chains and struggling with his brother.How the two came into that awful position was never discovered, and I
could only judge by inference that Kristel, in the dead of this deadly
night, had made his way by some means to the lighthouse, and was
endeavouring to effect an entrance, when Silvain, awakened by his
attempts, had gone out to him, and was instantly seized and dragged
down."So fearful and confused were the minutes that immediately followed
that I have but an indistinct impression of the occurrences of the
time, which will live ever within me as the most awful in my life.I
know that I never lost my grasp of Avicia, and that but for me she
would have flung herself over the walls; I know that the brothers were
engaged in a struggle for life and death, and that Silvain continued
to make the most pathetic appeals to Kristel to listen to him, and not
to stain his soul with blood; I know that in those appeals there were
the tenderest references to their boyhood's days, to the love which
had existed between them, each for the other, to trivial incidents in
their childhood, to their mother who worshipped them and was now
looking down upon them, to the hopes in which they had indulged of a
life of harmony and affection; I know that it struck me then as most
terrible that during the whole of the struggle no word issued from
Kristel's lips; I know that there were heartrending appeals from
Avicia to Kristel to spare her husband, and that there were tender
cries from her to Silvain, and from Silvain to her; I know that,
finding a loose chain on the gallery, I lowered it to the combatants,
and called out to Silvain--foolishly enough, in so far as he could
avail himself of it--to release himself from his brother's arms and
seize it, and that I and Avicia would draw him up to safety; I know
that in one vivid flash of lightning I saw the struggling forms and
the beautiful white spray of the waves; I know that Silvain's voice
grew fainter and fainter until it was heard no more; I know that there
was the sound of a heavy body or bodies falling into the sea, that a
shriek of woe and despair clove my heart like a knife, and that Avicia
lay in my arms moaning and trembling.I bore her tenderly into her
room, and laid her on her bed."The storm ceased; no sound was heard without.The rising sun filled
the eastern horizon with loveliest hues of saffron and crimson.The
sea was calm; there was no trace of tempest and human agony.By that
time Avicia was a mother, and lay with her babes pressed to her bosom.Silvain's fear was realised: he was the dead father of twin brothers."The assistant whom Avicia's father had engaged rowed me to the
village, and there I enlisted the services of a woman, who accompanied
me back to the lighthouse, and attended to Avicia.The mother lived
but two days after the birth of her babes.Until her last hour she was
delirious, but then she recovered her senses and recognised me."'My dear Silvain told me,' she said, in a weak, faint voice, 'that
you would be a friend to our children.Bless the few moments remaining
to me by assuring me that you will not desert them.'"I gave her the assurance for which she yearned, and she desired me to
call them by the names of Eric and Emilius.It rejoiced me that she
passed away in peace; strange as it may seem, it was an inexpressible
relief to her bruised heart that the long agony was over.Her last
words were,

"'I trust you."And so, with her nerveless hand in mine, her spirit went out to her
lover and husband."We buried her in the village churchyard, and the day was observed as
a day of mourning in that village by the sea."I thought I could not do better than leave the twin babes for a time
in the charge of the woman I had engaged, and it occurred to me that
it might not be unprofitable to have some inquiries and investigation
made with respect to the inheritance left by their grandfather to his
sons Kristel and Silvain.I placed the matter in the hands of a shrewd
lawyer, and he was enabled to recover a portion of what was due to
their father.This was a great satisfaction to me, as it to some
extent provided for the future of Eric and Emilius, and supplied the
wherewithal for their education.It was my intention, when they
arrived at a certain age, to bring them to my home in Nerac, and treat
them as children of my own, but a difficulty cropped up for which I
was not prepared and which I could not surmount.Avicia's father,
learning that I had recovered a portion of Silvain's inheritance,
demanded from me an account of it, and asserted his rights as the
natural guardian of his grandchildren.There was no gainsaying the
demand, and I was compelled reluctantly to leave Eric and Emilius in
his charge.I succeeded, however, in prevailing upon him to allow them
to pay me regular visits of long duration, so that a close intimacy of
affectionate friendship has been established between them and the
members of my family.Here ends my story--a strange and eventful one,
you will admit.I often think of it in wonder, and this is the first
time a full recital of it has passed my lips."Such a story, which Doctor Louis truly described as strange and
eventful, could not have failed to leave a deep impression upon me.During its recital I had, as it were, been charmed out of myself.My
instinctive distrust of the twin brothers Eric and Emilius, the growth
of a groundless jealousy, was for a while forgotten, and at the
conclusion of the recital I was lost in the contemplation of the
tragic pictures which had been presented to my mind's eye.Singularly
enough, the most startling bit of colour in these pictures, that of
the two brothers in their life and death struggle on the outer walls
of the lighthouse, was not to me the dominant feature of the
remarkable story.The awful, unnatural contest, Avicias agony,
Silvain's soul-moving appeals, and the dread silence of Kristel--all
this was as nought in comparison with the figure of a solitary man
standing on the seashore, gazing in the direction of his lost
happiness.I traced his life back through the years during which he
was engaged in his relentless pursuit of the brother who had brought
desolation into his life.In him, and in him alone, was centred the
true pathos of the story; it was he who had been robbed, it was he who
had been wronged.No deliberate act of treachery lay at his door; he
loved, and had been deceived.Those in whom he placed his trust had
deliberately betrayed him.The vengeance he sought and consummated was
just.I did not make Doctor Louis acquainted with my views on the subject,
knowing that he would not agree with me, and that all his sympathies
were bestowed upon Silvain.There was something of cowardice in this
concealment of my feelings, but although I experienced twinges of
conscience for my want of courage, it was not difficult for me to
justify myself in my own eyes.Doctor Louis was the father of the
woman I loved, and in his hands lay my happiness.On no account must I
instil doubt into his mind; he was a man of decided opinions,
dogmatic, and strong-willed.No act or word of mine must cause him to
have the least distrust of me.Therefore I played the cunning part,
and was silent with respect to those threads in the story which
possessed the firmest hold upon his affections.This enforced silence accentuated and strengthened my view.Silvain
and Avicia were weak, feeble creatures.The man of great heart and
resolute will, the man whose sufferings and wrongs made him a martyr,
was Kristel.Trustful, heroic,
unflinching.But he and his brother, and the woman
who had been the instrument of their fate, belonged to the past.They
were dead and gone, and in the presence of Doctor Louis I put them
aside a while.Time enough to think of them when I was alone.They lived, and between their
lives and mine there was a link.Of this I entertained no doubt, nor
did I doubt that, in this connection, the future would not be
colourless for us.To be prepared for the course which events might
take: this was now my task and my duty."As Kristel acted, so would I act, in love and hate."I observed Doctor Louis's eyes fixed earnestly upon my face."Is not such a story," I said evasively, "enough to agitate one?Its
movements are as the movements of a sublime tragedy.""True," mused Doctor Louis; "even in obscure lives may be found such
elements.""You have told me little," I said, "of Eric and Emilius.Do they
reside permanently in the lighthouse in which their mother died?""They have a house in the village by the sea," replied Doctor Louis,
"and they are in a certain sense fishermen on a large scale.The place
has possessed for them a fascination, and it seemed as if they would
never be able to tear themselves away from it.But their intimate
association with it will soon be at an end.""They have sold their house and boats, and are coming to reside in
Nerac for a time."I started and turned aside, for I did not wish Doctor Louis to see the
cloud upon my face."It depends upon circumstances," said Doctor Louis."If they are happy
and contented in the present and in their prospects in the future,
they will remain.We have talked of it
often, and I have urged them not to waste their lives in a village so
small and primitive as that in which they were born.""Somewhat destructive of your own theories of happiness, doctor," I
observed."Yourself, for instance, wasting your life in a small place
like Nerac, when by your gifts you are so well fitted to play your
part in a large city.""I am selfish, I am afraid," he said with a deprecatory smile, "and am
too much wrapped up in my own ease and comfort.At the same time you
must bear in mind that mine is an exceptional case.It is a regretful
thing to be compelled to say that the majority of lives and homes are
less happy than my own.Often there is love, and poverty stands at the
bright door which opens but on a scene of privation and ill-requited
toil.Often there is wealth, in the use of which there has been an
endeavour to purchase love, which, my friend, is not a marketable
commodity.Often there are sorrow and sickness, and neither faith nor
patience to lighten the load.It is my good fortune to have none of
these ills.We have love and good health, and a sufficient share of
worldly prosperity to provide for our days.Therefore I will leave
myself out of the question.he cried, interrupting himself in a
tone at once light and earnest; "am I entirely useless in Nerac?"You do much," I said, "and also do Eric and Emilius in their village.You have admitted that they are fishermen on a large scale, and
possess boats.Consequently they employ labour, and the wages they pay
support the homes of those who serve them.""With some young men," said Doctor Louis, with a good-humoured laugh,
"there is no arguing.They are so keen in defence that they have a
formidable parry for every thrust.To the point, then, without
argument.Eric and Emilius have in them certain qualities which render
me doubtful whether, as middle-aged men, they would be in their proper
sphere in their village by the sea.The maidens there find no serious
favour in their eyes.""Do they look," I asked, with a torturing pang of jealousy, "with a
more appreciative eye upon the maidens in Nerac?""Tush, tush," said Doctor Louis, in a kind tone, laying his hand upon
my shoulder; "vex not yourself unnecessarily.Youth's hot blood is a
torrent, restless by day and night, never satisfied, never content,
for ever seeking cause to fret and fume.You have given evidence of
wisdom, Gabriel--exercise it when it is most needed."Of all the maidens in Nerac," I said, striving to speak with
calmness, "Lauretta is the fairest and sweetest."I, her father, will not gainsay you.""Is it because she is fairer and sweeter than any Eric and Emilius
have seen in the village by the sea that they quit their home there,
and come to live in Nerac?"Were I simply an ordinary friend of yours, and not
Lauretta's father, I might feel inclined to play with you; but as
it is, my happiness here is too largely at stake.Viewing with a selfish eye--a human failing, common
enough--your own immediate affairs, forget not that I, Lauretta's
father, am as deeply concerned in them as yourself.Never would I be
guilty of the crime of forcing my child's affections.Do you think I
love her less than you do?If it should be your happy fate to be a
father, you will learn how much purer and higher is the love of a
father than that which a young man, after an hour's acquaintance,
bears for the maiden whom he would wed.""It cannot be said to be more," responded Doctor Louis gravely,
"compared with my knowledge of my child."The retort was well-merited, and I murmured, "Forgive me!"The
consistently sweet accents of Doctor Louis's voice produced in me, at
this moment, a feeling of self-reproach, and a true sense of my
petulance and imperiousness forced itself upon me."There is little need to ask forgiveness," said Doctor Louis; "I can
make full allowance for the impetuous passions of youth, and if I wish
you to place a curb upon them it is for your welfare and that of my
child.Indulgence in such extravagances leads to injustice.Gabriel, I
will be entirely frank with you.Before your arrival in Nerac I had a
slight suspicion that one of the brothers--towards both of whom I feel
as a father--had an affection for Lauretta which might have ripened
into love.It is in the nature of things that a beautiful girl should
inspire a sentiment in the breasts of more than one man, but she can
belong only to one, to him to whom her heart is drawn.What passed
between us when you spoke to me as a lover of my daughter was honest
and outspoken.The encouragement you received from me would have been
withheld had it not been that I saw you occupied a place in Lauretta's
heart, and that the one end and aim I have in view is her happiness.""Is it too much to ask," I said, "to which of the brothers you
referred?""Altogether too much," replied Doctor Louis."It is an unrevealed
secret, and the right is not mine to say more than I have said."I did not speak for a little while; I was the slave of conflicting
passions.One moment I believed entirely in Doctor Louis; another
moment I doubted him; and through all I was oppressed by a
consciousness that I was doing him an injustice."Nothing special, sir," was my
reply, "but in a general way.""Born under such singular circumstances, and of such a father as
Silvain, it would not be unnatural to suppose that they might inherit
some touch of his strangely sympathetic nature.""They have inherited it," said Doctor Louis; "there exists between
them a sympathy as strange as that which existed in Silvain.I am at
liberty to say nothing more."He spoke in a firm tone, and I did not question him further.As I
accompanied him home we conversed upon general subjects, and I took
pains to convey to him an assurance that there was nothing really
serious in the ungracious temper I had displayed.He was relieved at
this, and we fell into our old confidential manner with each other.I passed the evening, as usual, in the society of his wife and
Lauretta.Peace descended upon me, and in the sweet presence of these
pure women I was tranquil and happy.How lovely, how beautiful was
this home of love and tender thought!The wild storms of life died
away, and strains of soft, angelic music melted the heart, and made
themselves heard even in the midst of the silences.Doctor Louis's
gaiety returned to him; he smiled upon me, and indulged in many a
harmless jest.I was charmed out of my moody humour, and contributed
to the innocent enjoyment of the home circle.The hours passed till it
was near bed-time, and then it was that a change came over me.Sitting
by Lauretta's side, turning the pages of an illustrated book of
travel, I heard the names of Eric and Emilius spoken by Doctor Louis.He was telling his wife of the impending change in their mode of life,
and there was an affectionate note in his voice, and also in hers,
which jarred upon me.I started to my feet, and they all turned to me
in surprise.I recovered myself in a moment, and explained that I had
suddenly thought of something which rendered it necessary that I
should go at once to the house I had taken, and of which Martin Hartog
was at present the sole custodian."But you were not to leave us till the end of the week," expostulated
Lauretta's mother."Indeed it is," I replied, "and should have been attended to earlier."You need have no anxiety; everything is prepared, and I
shall be quite comfortable.""My wife is thinking of the sheets," observed Doctor Louis jocosely;
"whether they are properly aired.""I have seen to that," she said, "and there is a fire in every room.""Then we can safely let him go," rejoined Doctor Louis."He is old
enough to take care of himself, and, besides, he is now a householder,
and has duties.We shall see you to-morrow, Gabriel?""Yes, I shall be here in the morning."So I wished them good-night, and presently was out in the open,
walking through dark shadows.In solitude I reviewed with amazement the occurrences of the last few
moments.It seemed to me that I had been impelled to do what I had
done by an occult agency outside myself.Not that I did not approve of
it.It was in accordance with my intense wish and desire--which had
lain dormant in the sweet society of Lauretta--to be alone, in order
that I might, without interruption, think over the story I had heard
from Doctor Louis's lips.And now that this wish and desire were
gratified, the one figure which still rose vividly before me was the
figure of Kristel.As I walked onward I followed the hapless man
mentally in his just pursuit of the brother who had snatched the cup
of happiness from his lips.Yes, it was just and right, and what he
did I would have done under similar circumstances.Of all who had
taken part in the tragic drama he, and he alone, commanded my
sympathy.The distance from Doctor Louis's house to mine was under two miles,
but I prolonged it by a _detour_ which brought me, without
premeditation, to the inn known as the Three Black Crows.I had no
intention of going there or of entering the inn, and yet, finding
myself at the door, I pushed it open, and walked into the room in
which the customers took their wine.This room was furnished with
rough tables and benches, and I seated myself, and in response to the
landlord's inquiry, ordered a bottle of his best, and invited him to
share it with me.He, nothing loth, accepted the invitation, and sat
at the table, emptying his glass, which I continued to fill for him,
while my own remained untasted.I had been inside the Three Black
Crows on only one occasion, in the company of Doctor Louis, and the
landlord now expressed his gratitude for the honour I did him by
paying him another visit.It was only the sense of his words which
reached my ears, my attention being almost entirely drawn to two men
who were seated at a table at the end of the room, drinking bad wine
and whispering to each other.Observing my eyes upon them, the
landlord said in a low tone, "Strangers."Their backs were towards me, and I could not see their faces, but I
noticed that one was humpbacked, and that, to judge from their attire,
they were poor peasants."I asked them," said the landlord, "whether they wanted a bed, and
they answered no, that they were going further.If they had stopped
here the night I should have kept watch on them!""I don't like their looks, and my wife's a timorous creature.Then
there's the children--you've seen my little ones, I think, sir?"Surely those men would do them no harm!""Perhaps not, sir; but a man, loving those near to him, thinks of the
possibilities of things.I've got a bit of money in the house, to pay
my rent that's due to-morrow, and one or two other accounts."Do you think they have come to Nerac on a robbing expedition?"Roguery has a plain face, and the signs are in
theirs, or my name's not what it is.When they said they were going
further on I asked them where, and they said it was no business of
mine.They gave me the same answer when I asked them where they came
from.They're up to no good, that's certain, and the sooner they're
out of the village the better for all of us."The more the worthy landlord talked the more settled became his
instinctive conviction that the strangers were rogues."If robbery is their errand," I said thoughtfully, "there are houses
in Nerac which would yield them a better harvest than yours.""Of course there is," was his response.He
has generally some money about him, and his silver plate would be a
prize.Are you going back there to-night, sir?""No; I am on my road to my own house, and I came out of the way a
little for the sake of the walk.""That's my profit, sir," said the landlord cheerfully."I would offer
to keep you company if it were not that I don't like to leave my
place.""There's nothing to fear," I said; "if they molest me I shall be a
match for them.""Still," urged the landlord, "I should leave before they do.It's as
well to avoid a difficulty when we have the opportunity."I took the hint, and paid my score.To all appearance there was no
reason for alarm on my part; during the time the landlord and I were
conversing the strangers had not turned in our direction, and as we
spoke in low tones they could not have heard what we said.They
remained in the same position, with their backs towards us, now
drinking in silence, now speaking in whispers to each other.Outside the Three Black Crows I walked slowly on, but I had not gone
fifty yards before I stopped.What was in my mind was the reference
made by the landlord to Doctor Louis's house and to its being worth
the plundering.The doctor's house contained what was dearer to me
than life or fortune.Should I leave her at the
mercy of these scoundrels who might possibly have planned a robbery of
the doctor's money and plate?In that case Lauretta would be in
danger.I would return to the Three
Black Crows, and look through the window of the room in which I had
left the men, to ascertain whether they were still there.If they
were, I would wait for them till they left the inn, and then would set
a watch upon their movements.If they were gone I would hasten to the
doctor's house, to render assistance, should any be needed.I had no
weapon, with the exception of a small knife; could I not provide
myself with something more formidable?A few paces from where I stood
were some trees with stout branches.I detached one of these branches,
and with my small knife fashioned it into a weapon which would serve
my purpose.It was about four feet in length, thick at the striking
end and tapering towards the other, so that it could be held with ease
and used to good purpose.I tried it on the air, swinging it round and
bringing it down with sufficient force to kill a man, or with
certainty to knock the senses out of him in one blow.Then I returned
to the inn, and looked through the window.In the settlement of my
proceedings I had remembered there was a red blind over the window
which did not entirely cover it, and through the uncovered space I now
saw the strangers sitting at the table as I had left them.Taking care to make no noise I stepped away from the window, and took
up a position from which I could see the door of the inn, which was
closed.I myself was in complete darkness, and there was no moon to
betray me; all that was needed from me was caution.I watched fully half an hour before the door of the inn was opened.No
person had entered during my watch, the inhabitants of Nerac being
early folk for rest and work.The two strangers lingered for a moment
upon the threshold, peering out into the night; behind them was the
landlord, with a candle in his hand.I did not observe that any words
passed between them and the landlord; they stepped into the road, and
the door was closed upon them.Then came the sounds of locking and
bolting doors and windows.I saw the faces of the men as they stood upon the threshold; they were
evil-looking fellows enough, and their clothes were of the commonest.For two or three minutes they did not stir; there had been nothing in
their manner to arouse suspicion, and the fact of their lingering on
the roadway seemed to denote that they were uncertain of the route
they should take.That they raised their faces to the sky was not
against them; it was a natural seeking for light to guide them.To the left lay the little nest of buildings amongst which were Father
Daniel's chapel and modest house, and the more pretentious dwelling of
Doctor Louis; to the right were the woods, at the entrance of which my
own house was situated.The left,
and it was part evidence of a guilty design.The right, and it would
be part proof that the landlord's suspicions were baseless.They exchanged a few words which did not reach my ears.Then they
moved onwards to the left.I grasped my weapon, and crept after them.But they walked only a dozen steps, and paused.In my mind
was the thought, "Continue the route you have commenced, and you are
dead men.The direction of the village was the more tempting to men who
had no roof to shelter them, for the reason that in Father Daniel's
chapel--which, built on an eminence, overlooked the village--lights
were visible from the spot upon which I and they were standing.There
was the chance of a straw bed and charity's helping hand, never
withheld by the good priest from the poor and wretched.On their right
was dense darkness; not a glimmer of light.Nevertheless, after the exchange of a few more words which, like the
others, were unheard by me, they seemed to resolve to seek the
gloomier way.They turned from the village, and facing me, walked past
me in the direction of the woods.I breathed more freely, and fell into a curious mental consideration
of the relief I experienced.Was it because, walking as they were from
the village in which Lauretta was sleeping, I was spared the taking of
these men's lives?It was because of the indication they afforded
me that Lauretta was not in peril.In her defence I could have
justified the taking of a hundred lives.No feeling of guilt would
have haunted me; there would have been not only no remorse but no pity
in my soul.The violation of the most sacred of human laws would be
justified where Lauretta was concerned.She was mine, to cherish, to
protect, to love--mine, inalienably.She belonged to no other man, and
none should step between her and me--neither he whose ruffianly design
threatened her with possible harm, nor he, in a higher and more
polished grade, who strove to win her affections and wrest them from
me.In an equal way both were equally my enemies, and I should be
justified in acting by them as Kristel had acted to Silvain.Ah, but he had left it too late.Not so would I. Let but the faintest
breath of certainty wait upon suspicion, and I would scotch it
effectually for once and all.Had Kristel possessed the strange power
in his hours of dreaming which Silvain possessed, he would not have
been robbed of the happiness which was his by right.He would have
been forewarned, and Avicia would have been his wife.In every step in
life he took there would have been the fragrance of flowers around
him, and a heavenly light.Did I, then, admit that there was any resemblance in the characters of
Avicia and Lauretta?No; one was a weed, the other a rose.Here low desire and cunning; there
angelic purity and goodness.But immeasurably beneath Lauretta as
Avicia was, Kristel's love for the girl would have made her radiant
and spotless.All this time I was stealthily following the strangers to the woods.The sound arrested them; they clutched each other in
fear.I stood motionless, and they stood without movement for many moments.Then they simultaneously emitted a deep-drawn sigh."It was the wind," said the man who had already spoken.I smiled in contempt; not a breath of wind was stirring; there was not
the flutter of a leaf, not the waving of the lightest branch.They resumed their course, and I crept after them noiselessly.They
entered the wood; the trees grew more thickly clustered."This will do," I heard one say; and upon the words they threw
themselves to the ground, and fell into slumber.I bent over them and was
satisfied.The landlord of the Three Black Crows was mistaken.I moved
softly away, and when I was at a safe distance from them I lit a match
and looked at my watch; it was twenty minutes to eleven, and before
the minute-hand had passed the hour I arrived at my house.The door
was fast, but I saw a light in the lower room of the gardener's
cottage, which I had given to Martin Hartog as a residence for him and
his daughter."Hartog is awake," I thought; "expecting me perhaps."I knocked at the door of the cottage, and received no answer; I
knocked again with the same result.The door had fastenings of lock and latch.I put my hand to the latch,
and finding that the key had not been turned in the lock, opened the
door and entered.The room, however, was not without an occupant.At the table sat a
young girl, the gardener's daughter, asleep.She lay back in her
chair, and the light shone upon her face.I had seen her when she was
awake, and knew that she was beautiful, but as I gazed now upon her
sleeping form I was surprised to discover that she was even fairer
than I had supposed.She had hair of dark brown, which curled most
gracefully about her brow and head; her face, in its repose, was sweet
to look upon; she was not dressed as the daughter of a labouring man,
but with a certain daintiness and taste which deepened my surprise;
there was lace at her sleeves and around her white neck.Had I not
known her station I should have taken her for a lady.She was young,
not more than eighteen or nineteen I judged, and life's springtime lay
sweetly upon her.There was a smile of wistful tenderness on her lips.Her left arm was extended over the table, and her hand rested upon the
portrait of a man, almost concealing the features.Her right hand,
which was on her lap, enfolded a letter, and that and the
portrait--which, without curious prying, I saw was not that of her
father--doubtless were the motive of a pleasant dream.I took in all this in a momentary glance, and quickly left the room,
closing the door behind me.Then I knocked loudly and roughly, and
heard the hurried movements of a sudden awaking.She came to the door
and cried softly, "Is that you, father?She opened the door, and fell back a step in confusion."I should have let your father know," I said, "that I intended to
sleep here to-night--but indeed it was a hasty decision."Oh, no, sir," she said.Father is away on
business; I expected him home earlier, and waiting for him I fell
asleep.The servants are not coming till to-morrow morning."She gave them to me, and asked if she could do anything for me.I
answered no, that there was nothing required.As I wished her
good-night a man's firm steps were heard, and Martin Hartog appeared.He cast swift glances at his daughter and me, and it struck me that
they were not devoid of suspicion.I explained matters, and he
appeared contented with my explanation; then bidding his daughter go
indoors he accompanied me to the house.There was a fire in my bedroom, almost burnt out, and the handiwork of
an affectionate and capable housewife was everywhere apparent.Martin
Hartog showed an inclination then and there to enter into particulars
of the work he had done in the grounds during my absence, but I told
him I was tired, and dismissed him.I listened to his retreating
footsteps, and when I heard the front door closed I blew out the
candle and sat before the dying embers in the grate.Darkness was best
suited to my mood, and I sat and mused upon the events of the last
forty-eight hours.Gradually my thoughts became fixed upon the figures
of the two strangers I had left sleeping in the woods, in connection
with the suspicion of their designs which the landlord had imparted to
me.So concentrated was my attention that I re-enacted all the
incidents of which they were the inspirers--the fashioning of the
branch into a weapon, the watch I had set upon them, their issuing
from the inn, the landlord standing behind with the candle in his
hand, their lingering in the road, the first steps they took towards
the village, their turning back, and my stealthy pursuit after
them--not the smallest detail was omitted.I do not remember
undressing and going to bed.Encompassed by silence and darkness I was
only spiritually awake.I was aroused at about eight o'clock in the morning by the arrival of
the servants of the household whom Lauretta's mother had engaged for
me, They comprised a housekeeper, who was to cook and generally
superintend, and two stout wenches to do the rougher work.In such a
village as Nerac these, in addition to Martin Hartog, constituted an
establishment of importance.They had been so well schooled by Lauretta's mother before commencing
the active duties of their service, that when I rose I found the
breakfast-table spread, and the housekeeper in attendance to receive
my orders.This augured well, and I experienced a feeling of
satisfaction at the prospect of the happy life before me.Lauretta would be not only a sweet and loving
companion, but the same order and regularity would reign in our home
as in the home of her childhood.I blessed the chance, if chance it
was, which had led me to Nerac, and as I paced the room and thought of
Lauretta, I said audibly, "Thank God!"Breakfast over, I strolled into the grounds, and made a careful
inspection of the work which Martin Hartog had performed.The
conspicuous conscientiousness of his labours added to my satisfaction,
and I gave expression to it.He received my approval in manly fashion,
and said he would be glad if I always spoke my mind, "as I always
speak mine," he added.It pleased me that he was not subservient; in
all conditions of life a man owes it to himself to maintain, within
proper bounds, a spirit of independence.While he was pointing out to
me this and that, and urging me to make any suggestions which occurred
to me, his daughter came up to us and said that a man wished to speak
to me.I asked who the man was, and she replied, "The landlord of the
Three Black Crows."Curious as to his purpose in making so early a
call, and settling it with myself that his errand was on business, in
connection, perhaps, with some wine he wished to dispose of, I told
the young woman to send him to me, and presently he appeared.There
was an expression of awkwardness, I thought, in his face as he stood
before me, cap in hand."Well, landlord," I said smiling; "you wish to see me?""Go on," I said, wondering somewhat at his hesitation."Can I speak to you alone, sir?"Hartog, I will see you again presently."Martin Hartog took the hint, and left us together."It's about those two men, sir, you saw in my place last night."I said, pondering, and then a light broke upon me,
and I thought it singular--as indeed it was--that no recollection,
either of the men or the incidents in association with them should
have occurred to me since my awaking."_You_ are quite safe, sir," said the landlord, "I am glad to find.""Quite safe, landlord; but why should you be so specially glad?""That's what brought me round so early this morning, for one thing; I
was afraid something _might_ have happened.""Kindly explain yourself," I said, not at all impatient, but amused
rather."Well, sir, they might have found out, somehow or other, that you were
sleeping in the house alone last night"--and here he broke off and
asked, "You _did_ sleep here alone last night?""Certainly I did, and a capital night's rest I had."As I was saying, if they had found out that
you were sleeping here alone, they might have taken it into their
heads to trouble you.""They might, landlord, but facts are stubborn things."I understand that now, sir, but I had my fears, and that's what
brought me round for one thing.""An expression you have used once before, landlord.I
infer there must be another thing in your mind.""As yet I have heard nothing but a number of very enigmatical
observations from you with respect to those men.Ah, yes, I remember;
you had your doubts of them when I visited you on my road home?""I had sir; I told you I didn't like the looks of them, and that I was
not easy in my mind about my own family, and the bit of money I had in
my place to pay my rent with, and one or two other accounts.""That is so; you are bringing the whole affair back to me.I saw the
men after I left the Three Black Crows.""To tell you would be to interrupt what you have come here to say."Well, sir, this is the way of it.I suspected them from the first,
and you will bear witness of it before the magistrate.They were
strangers in Nerac, but that is no reason why I should have refused to
sell them a bottle of red wine when they asked for it.It's my trade
to supply customers, and the wine was the worst I had, consequently
the cheapest.I had no right to ask their business, and if they chose
to answer me uncivilly, it was their affair.I wouldn't tell everybody
mine on the asking.They paid for the wine, and there was an end of
it.They called for another bottle, and when I brought it I did not
draw the cork till I had the money for it, and as they wouldn't pay
the price--not having it about 'em--the cork wasn't drawn, and the
bottle went back.I had trouble to get rid of them, but they stumbled
out at last, and I saw no more of them.Now, sir, you will remember
that when we were speaking of them Doctor Louis's house was mentioned
as a likely house for rogues to break into and rob.""The villains couldn't hear what we said, no more than we could hear
what they were whispering about.But they had laid their plans, and
tried to hatch them--worse luck for one, if not for both the
scoundrels; but the other will be caught and made to pay for it.What
they did between the time they left the Three Black Crows and the time
they made an attempt to break into Doctor Louis's is at present a
mystery.Don't be alarmed, sir; I see that my news has stirred you,
but they have only done harm to themselves.No one else is a bit the
worse for their roguery.Doctor Louis and his good wife and daughter
slept through the night undisturbed; nothing occurred to rouse or
alarm them.They got up as usual, the doctor being the first--he is
known as an early riser.As it happened, it was fortunate that he was
outside his house before his lady, for although we in Nerac have an
idea that she is as brave as she is good, a woman, after all, is only
a woman, and the sight of blood is what few of them can stand."But that I was assured that
Lauretta was safe and well, I should not have wasted a moment on the
landlord, eager as I was to learn what he had come to tell.My mind,
however, was quite at ease with respect to my dear girl, and the next
few minutes were not so precious that I could not spare them to hear
the landlord's strange story."That," he resumed, "is what the doctor saw when he went to the back
of his house.Blood on the ground--and what is more, what would have
given the ladies a greater shock, there before him was the body of a
man--dead.""That I can't for a certainty say, sir, because I haven't seen him as
yet.I'm telling the story second-hand, as it was told to me a while
ago by one who had come straight from the doctor's house.There was
the blood, and there the man; and from the description I should say it
was one of the men who were drinking in my place last night.It is not
ascertained at what time of the night he and his mate tried to break
into the doctor's house, but the attempt was made.They commenced to bore a hole in one of the shutters
at the back; the hole made, it would have been easy to enlargen it,
and so to draw the fastenings.However, they did not get so far as
that.They could scarcely have been at their scoundrelly work a minute
or two before it came to an end.""How and by whom were they interrupted, landlord?"It is not known, sir, and it's just at this point that the mystery
commences.There they are at their work, and likely to be successful.A dark night, and not a watchman in the village.Never a need for one,
sir.Plenty of time before them, and desperate men they.Only one man
in the house, the good doctor; all the others women, easily dealt
with.Robbery first--if interfered with, murder afterwards.They
wouldn't have stuck at it, not they!But there it was, sir, as God
willed.Not a minute at work, and something occurs.The man lies dead on the ground, with a gimlet in his hand, and
Doctor Louis, in full sunlight, stands looking down on the strange
sight.""The man lies dead on the ground," I said, repeating the landlord's
words; "but there were two.""No sign of the other, sir; he's a vanished body."He will be found," I said----

"It's to be hoped," interrupted the landlord."And then what you call a mystery will be solved.""It's beyond me, sir," said the landlord, with a puzzled air.These two scoundrels, would-be murderers, plan a
robbery, and proceed to execute it.They are ill-conditioned
creatures, no better than savages, swayed by their passions, in which
there is no show of reason.They quarrel, perhaps, about the share of
the spoil which each shall take, and are not wise enough to put aside
their quarrel till they are in possession of the booty.They continue
their dispute, and in such savages their brutal passions once roused,
swell and grow to a fitting climax of violence.Probably the disagreement commenced on their way to the house, and had
reached an angry point when one began to bore a hole in the shutter.The proof was in his hand--the
gimlet with which he was working.""Well conceived, sir," said the landlord, following with approval my
speculative explanation."This man's face," I continued, "would be turned toward the shutter,
his back to his comrade.Into this comrade's mind darts, like a
lightning flash, the idea of committing the robbery alone, and so
becoming the sole possessor of the treasure.""Good, sir, good," said the landlord, rubbing his hands.Out comes his knife, or perhaps he
has it ready in his hand, opened.""No; such men carry clasp-knives.They are safest, and never attract
notice.""You miss nothing, sir," said the landlord admiringly."What a
magistrate you would have made!""He plunges it into his fellow-scoundrel's back, who falls dead, with
the gimlet in his hand.The landlord nodded excitedly, and continued to rub his hands; then
suddenly stood quite still, with an incredulous expression on his
face."But the robbery is not committed," he exclaimed; "the house is not
broken into, and the scoundrel gets nothing for his pains."With superior wisdom I laid a patronising hand upon his shoulder."The deed done," I said, "the murderer, gazing upon his dead comrade,
is overcome with fear.He has been rash--he may be caught red-handed;
the execution of the robbery will take time.He is not familiar with
the habits of the village, and does not know it has no guardians of
the night.He has not only committed murder, he has robbed himself.Better
to have waited till they had possession of the treasure; but this kind
of logic always comes afterwards to ill-regulated minds.Under the
influence of his newly-born fears he recognises that every moment is
precious; he dare not linger; he dare not carry out the scheme.Shuddering, he flies from the spot, with rage and despair in his
heart.The landlord, who was profuse in the expressions of his admiration at
the light I had thrown upon the case, so far as it was known to us,
accompanied me to the house of Doctor Louis.It was natural that I
should find Lauretta and her mother in a state of agitation, and it
was sweet to me to learn that it was partly caused by their anxieties
for my safety.Doctor Louis was not at home, but had sent a messenger
to my house to inquire after me, and to give me some brief account of
the occurrences of the night.We did not meet this messenger on our
way to the doctor's; he must have taken a different route from ours."You did wrong to leave us last night," said Lauretta's mother
chidingly.I shook my head, and answered that it was but anticipating the date of
my removal by a few days, and that my presence in her house would not
have altered matters."Everything was right at home," I said.What inexpressible
sweetness there was in the word!"Martin Hartog showed me to my room,
and the servants you engaged came early this morning, and attended to
me as though they had known my ways and tastes for years.""A dreamless night," I replied; "but had I suspected what was going on
here, I should not have been able to rest.""I am glad you had no suspicion, Gabriel; you would have been in
danger.Dreadful as it all is, it is a comfort to know that the
misguided men do not belong to our village."Her merciful heart could find no harsher term than this to apply to
the monsters, and it pained her to hear me say, "One has met his
deserved fate; it is a pity the other has escaped."But I could not
keep back the words.Doctor Louis had left a message for me to follow him to the office of
the village magistrate, where the affair was being investigated, but
previous to going thither, I went to the back of the premises to make
an inspection.The village boasted of one constable, and he was now on
duty, in a state of stupefaction.His orders were to allow nothing to
be disturbed, but his bewilderment was such that it would have been
easy for an interested person to do as he pleased in the way of
alteration.A stupid lout, with as much intelligence as a vegetable.However, I saw at once that nothing had been disturbed.The shutter in
which a hole had been bored was closed; there were blood stains on the
stones, and I was surprised that they were so few; the gate by which
the villains had effected an entrance into the garden was open; I
observed some particles of sawdust on the window-ledge just below
where the hole had been bored.All that had been removed was the body
of the man who had been murdered by his comrade.I put two or three questions to the constable, and he managed to
answer in monosyllables, yes and no, at random."A valuable
assistant," I thought, "in unravelling a mysterious case!"And then I
reproached myself for the sneer.Happy was a village like Nerac in
which crime was so rare, and in which an official so stupid was
sufficient for the execution of the law.The first few stains of blood I noticed were close to the window, and
the stones thereabout had been disturbed, as though by the falling of
a heavy body."Was the man's body," I inquired of the constable, "lifted from this
spot?"He looked down vacantly and said, "Yes.""Sure," he said after a pause, but whether the word was spoken in
reply to my question, or as a question he put to himself, I could not
determine.From the open gate to the
window was a distance of forty-eight yards; I stepped exactly a yard,
and I counted my steps.The path from gate to window was shaped like
the letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on
either side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this
path the villains had made their way to the window; through this path
the murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their
operations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been
conducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude
that, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must
have known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the
plundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious
turns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must
have felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,
most likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at
the open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the
shrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there
some stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were
indisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human
hands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with
my own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood
on the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly
torn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about
him, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both
for support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands
as he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the
murderer.Between
the victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became
of the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord
of the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of
crime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as
sudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped
without the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,
were the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been
grievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to
bring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had
invented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of
four rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the
magistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not
at all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely
that they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father
Daniel.During his lifetime no such
crime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was
that the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his
horror of the deed, and his large heart overflowed with pity both for
the guilty man and the victim.he said, in a voice broken by tears.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I
have been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his
murderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, "All
men should pray that they may never be tempted."And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to
offer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing
theories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my
own ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night."In certain respects you may be right in your speculations," the
magistrate said; "but on one important point you are in error.""I have already discovered," I said, "that my theory is wrong, and not
in accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently."As to the weapon with which the murder was done," replied the
magistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a
larger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac."A club of some sort," said the magistrate, "with which the dead man
was suddenly attacked from behind.""No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer."There is no shadow of doubt that the
missing man is guilty.""There can be none," said the magistrate."And yet," urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, "to condemn a man
unheard is repugnant to justice.""There are circumstances," said the magistrate, "which point so surely
to guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the
way," he continued, addressing me, "did not the landlord of the Three
Black Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn
last night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a
conversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the
same room as yourselves?""If he did," I said, "he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw
the strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have
been proved to be well founded.""Then you will be able to identify the body, already," added the
magistrate, "identified by the landlord.Confirmatory evidence
strengthens a case.""I shall be able to identify it," I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of
the strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and
whom I had afterwards watched and followed."The man who has escaped," I observed, "was hump backed.""That tallies with the landlord's statement," said the magistrate."I have something to relate," I said, upon our return to the court,
"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn."I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account
of my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my
thoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect
the doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the
safety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over
his daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm."But you ran a great risk, Gabriel," he said affectionately."I did not consider that," I said.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the
undivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound."At what time," he asked, "do you say you left the rogues asleep in
the woods?""It was twenty minutes to eleven," I replied, "and at eleven o'clock I
reached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog
was absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,
and I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and
accompanied me to my bedroom.""Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends
in consequence of what had passed?"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to
me to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I
was satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom
that I have enjoyed a better night."May not their slumbers have been feigned?"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.No,
I could not have been mistaken.""It is strange," mused Doctor Louis, "how guilt can sleep, and can
forget the present and the future!"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the
path from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,
from the position in which the body was found, that there had been no
struggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had
materially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed
also that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that
a struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his
assistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the
grounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the
evidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions."There are so many things to be considered," said Doctor Louis, "in a
case like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon
circumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not
be lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight
than those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite
patience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.You
believe, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?""Such is now my belief," I replied."Such signs as you have brought before our notice," continued the
doctor, "are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have
met with severe treatment?""Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?""Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable
disarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even
pavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the
utmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron
heels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and
all the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose
stones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without
conspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is
composed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear
evidence."Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel
as I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you
suppose these men to have been engaged?"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and
reluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my
observation."That is partially destructive of your theory," pursued the doctor."There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty
to say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept
more soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it
is really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I
think, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am
affected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant
weeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for
a long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence
upon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of
you."(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly
benignant smile.)"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the
dripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of
a cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,
unusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by
the boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must
have used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any
circumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have
aroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to
ascertain the cause."Then," said the magistrate, "how do you account for the injuries the
man who escaped must have undoubtedly received?"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There
was a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was
pushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one
whose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so
weak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I
recognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the
Three Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they
wandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing
steadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head
drooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran
through him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very
short time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be
obtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,
and although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was
in itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to
say in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not
a word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,
instructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a
strict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful
examination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise
his eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he
could not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and
each time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a
shudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the
room in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my
mind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the
conclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in
his right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his
crime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the
magistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of
pretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a
search for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for
none had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of
the ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in
guilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said
he had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour
or so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I
departed alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again
propounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which
he listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been
before that a struggle had taken place."But," he said, "whether a struggle for life did or did not take place
there is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always
viewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in
this instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,
to mete out to him the punishment for his crime."Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to
communicate to us."I have had," he said, "another interview with the prisoner, and have
succeeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,
and again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I
moved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to
loosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if
I was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the
fear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely
bound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He
repeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that
his question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses
to convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange
voice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of
men and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled
inwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a
prisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs
of levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to
me that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,
in order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had
committed.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the
question.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and
if you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in
this cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the
proof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was
listening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the
question,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me
to this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you
guilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did
not kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is
murdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have
killed me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him
in thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was
imposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I
said, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are
more powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is
why I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will
prove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in
which,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,
when you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in
self-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'
he said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel
perhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You
say,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if
you had not fled from him.''But,' I
said, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have
been your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon
you have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as
you say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered
at this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said
presently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I
played him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that
there should be in the world men with such a low order of
intelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.Demons glide noiselessly
along.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted
doggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get
nothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his
ridiculous defence, I left him.""Do you think," asked Doctor Louis, "that he has any, even the
remotest belief in the story?"I cannot believe it," replied the magistrate, "and yet I confess to
being slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which
might be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant
of the cunning of criminals.""Which means," said Doctor Louis, "that it is really not impossible
that the man's mind is diseased.""No," said the magistrate, in a positive tone, "I cannot for a moment
admit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a
stick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it
seemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been
no attempt at concealment."Here is the weapon," I cried, "with which the deed was done!"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it."Here," I said, pointing downwards, "is the direct line of flight
taken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror
as he ran.""It is an improvised weapon," said the magistrate, "cut but lately
from a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with
effect."I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its
resemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during
the watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and
said that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had
shaped with my knife."Do you remember," asked the magistrate, "what you did with it after
your suspicions were allayed?""No," I replied, "I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with
it.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it
this morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my
mind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it
aside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set
out to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,
and, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.""It is the only solution," said the magistrate."So that," I said with a sudden thrill of horror, "I am indirectly
responsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been
responsible had they used the weapon against those I love!"We have all happily been spared,
Gabriel," he said."It is only the guilty who have suffered."We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any
further evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,
and was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous
schemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this
evening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and
once, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done
unconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied
that he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had
entered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not
possible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing
as mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been
contrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning
Lauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a
feeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview
with the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended
belief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to
have some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure
which had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the
permission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further
admissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the
man persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his
own defence."I saw him this morning," the magistrate said, "and interrogated him
with severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be
innocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.""Have you asked him," I inquired, "to give you an account of all that
transpired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until
the moment he was arrested?""No," said the magistrate, "it did not occur to me to demand of him so
close a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should
have been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and
his invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is
conscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again
on minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature
warns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the
lowest order of criminals."My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial
account of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would
have extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed
where the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was
still bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than
before, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled
terror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and
lowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice
before he answered me."Why did you not reply to me at once?"But to this question, although
I repeated it also twice, he made no response."It is useless," I said sternly, "to attempt evasion with me, or to
think that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain
a confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it
from you, if you do not give it willingly."I understand you," he said, keeping his face averted from me, "but I
will not speak.""Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because
you have a design against me."His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my
intention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden
in his mind, and I was resolved to get at it."What design can I have against you," I said, "of which you need be
afraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for
you.Soon you
will be as dead as the man you murdered.""I did not murder him," was the strange reply, "and you know it.""You are playing the same trick upon me that you
played upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as
unsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you
than the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?"My body is, perhaps," he muttered, "but not my soul.""Oh," I said, in a tone of contempt, "you believe in a soul.""Yes," he replied, "do not you?"Not out of my fears, but out
of my hopes.""I have no hopes and no fears," he said."I have done wrong, but not
the wrong with which I am charged."His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to
make an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance."When I next command you," I said, "you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than
the pass to which you have brought it by your crime."And still he doggedly repeated, "I have committed no crime.""Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced
him to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His
eyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my
compelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the
weaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became
dimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we
remained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke."Relate to me," I said, "all that you know from the time you and the
man who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the
present moment."We were poor, both of us," Pierre commenced, "and had been poor all
our lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain
meat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had
been in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when
we were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;
starvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,
and so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing
else was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;
why should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some
sixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come
here and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a
rich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We
had no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a
slice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the
money he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us
to Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a
knock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to
them; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on
our way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the
straightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When
we entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money
left to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat
drinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with
the landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place
where we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were
talking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach
my ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We
wanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it
to us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were
bare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out
Doctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there
would be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past
midnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the
direction of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have
continued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,
I had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but
the idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I
determined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which
we had passed through before we reached the village, and there to
sleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into
execution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I
don't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember
hearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard
it too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and
heard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on
till we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we
threw ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I
pretended to be.I did not move;
I even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it
departed, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired
with the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us
which would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the
night I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I
woke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the
way.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses
had been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he
laughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked
round the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The
front of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we
made our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a
hole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our
being heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough
to enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We
did not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our
safety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be
shed.Our plan was to gag and tie
up any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;
we were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain
true to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked
away at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,
from the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not
move; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when
I heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club
was making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a
minute, and I turned and saw the demon.I
slanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,
fell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,
on my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,
tearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and
again, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,
till flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,
there was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than
the demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking
me so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag
myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.It was achieved without loss,
unopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise.The British
relieving force was at last, after many months' report, proved to be
a reality, and although late, it was not too late.If General Stewart
had not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would
undoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops
would have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman.But it
must be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the
required flash of genius.He paid more deference to the orders of Lord
Wolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon.General Stewart returned to Korti on the 7th January, bringing with
him the tired camels, and he found that during his absence still more
urgent news had been received from Gordon, to the effect that if aid
did not come within ten days from the 14th December, the place might
fall, and that under the nose of the expedition.The native who
brought this intimation arrived at Korti the day after General Stewart
left, but a messenger could easily have caught him up and given him
orders to press on at all cost.It was not realised at the time, but
the neglect to give that order, and the rigid adherence to a
preconceived plan, proved fatal to the success of the whole
expedition.The first advance of General Stewart had been in the nature of a
surprise, but it aroused the Mahdi to a sense of the position, and the
subsequent delay gave him a fortnight to complete his plans and assume
the offensive.On 12th January--that is, nine days after his first arrival at
Jakdul--General Stewart reached the place a second time with the
second detachment of another 1000 men--the total fighting strength of
the column being raised to about 2300 men.For whatever errors had
been committed, and their consequences, the band of soldiers assembled
at Jakdul on that 12th of January could in no sense be held
responsible.Without making any invidious comparisons, it may be
truthfully said that such a splendid fighting force was never
assembled in any other cause, and the temper of the men was strung to
a high point of enthusiasm by the thought that at last they had
reached the final stage of the long journey to rescue Gordon.A number
of causes, principally the fatigue of the camels from the treble
journey between Korti and Jakdul, made the advance very slow, and five
days were occupied in traversing the forty-five miles between Jakdul
and the wells at Abou Klea, themselves distant twenty miles from
Metemmah.On the morning of 17th January it became clear that the
column was in presence of an enemy.At the time of Stewart's first arrival at Jakdul there were no hostile
forces in the Bayuda desert.At Berber was a considerable body of the
Mahdi's followers, and both Metemmah and Shendy were held in his name.At the latter place a battery or small fort had been erected, and in
an encounter between it and Gordon's steamers one of the latter had
been sunk, thus reducing their total to four.But there were none of
the warrior tribes of Kordofan and Darfour at any of these places, or
nearer than the six camps which had been established round Khartoum.The news of the English advance made the Mahdi bestir himself, and as
it was known that the garrison of Omdurman was reduced to the lowest
straits, and could not hold out many days, the Mahdi despatched some
of his best warriors of the Jaalin, Degheim, and Kenana tribes to
oppose the British troops in the Bayuda desert.It was these men who
opposed the further advance of Sir Herbert Stewart's column at Abou
Klea.It is unnecessary to describe the desperate assault these
gallant warriors made on the somewhat cumbrous and ill-arranged square
of the British force, or the ease and tremendous loss with which these
fanatics were beaten off, and never allowed to come to close quarters,
save at one point.The infantry soldiers, who formed two sides of the
square, signally repulsed the onset, not a Ghazi succeeded in getting
within a range of 300 yards; but on another side, cavalrymen, doing
infantry soldiers' unaccustomed work, did not adhere to the strict
formation necessary, and trained for the close _melee_, and with the
_gaudia certaminis_ firing their blood, they recklessly allowed the
Ghazis to come to close quarters, and their line of the square was
impinged upon.In that close fighting, with the Heavy Camel Corps men
and the Naval Brigade, the Blacks suffered terribly, but they also
inflicted loss in return.Of a total loss on the British side of
sixty-five killed and sixty-one wounded, the Heavy Camel Corps lost
fifty-two, and the Sussex Regiment, performing work to which it was
thoroughly trained, inflicted immense loss on the enemy at hardly any
cost to itself.Among the slain was the gallant Colonel Fred.Burnaby,
one of the noblest and gentlest, as he was physically the strongest,
officers in the British army.There is no doubt that signal as was
this success, it shook the confidence of the force.The men were
resolute to a point of ferocity, but the leaders' confidence in
themselves and their task had been rudely tried; and yet the breaking
of the square had been clearly due to a tactical blunder, and the
inability of the cavalry to adapt themselves to a strange position.On the 18th January the march, rendered slower by the conveyance of
the wounded, was resumed, but no fighting took place on that day,
although it was clear that the enemy had not been dispersed.On the
19th, when the force had reached the last wells at Abou Kru or Gubat,
it became clear that another battle was to be fought.One of the first
shots seriously wounded Sir Herbert Stewart, and during the whole of
the affair many of our men were carried off by the heavy rifle fire of
the enemy.Notwithstanding that our force fought under many
disadvantages and was not skilfully handled, the Mahdists were driven
off with terrible loss, while our force had thirty-six killed and one
hundred and seven wounded.Notwithstanding these two defeats, the
enemy were not cowed, and held on to Metemmah, in which no doubt those
who had taken part in the battles were assisted by a force from
Berber.The 20th January was wasted in inaction, caused by the large
number of wounded, and when on 21st January Metemmah was attacked, the
Mahdists showed so bold a front that Sir Charles Wilson, who succeeded
to the command on Sir Herbert Stewart being incapacitated by his, as
it proved, mortal wound, drew off his force.This was the more
disappointing, because Gordon's four steamers arrived during the
action and took a gallant part in the attack.It was a pity for the
effect produced that that attack should have been distinctly
unsuccessful.The information the captain of these steamers, the
gallant Cassim el Mousse, gave about Gordon's position was alarming.He stated that Gordon had sent him a message informing him that if aid
did not come in ten days from the 14th December his position would be
desperate, and the volumes of his journal which he handed over to Sir
Charles Wilson amply corroborated this statement--the very last entry
under that date being these memorable words: "Now, mark this, if the
Expeditionary Force--and I ask for no more than 200 men--does not come
in ten days, _the town may fall_, and I have done my best for the
honour of our country.The other letters handed over by Cassim el Mousse amply bore out the
view that a month before the British soldiers reached the last stretch
of the Nile to Khartoum Gordon's position was desperate.In one to his
sister he concluded, "I am quite happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence,
have tried to do my duty," and in another to his friend Colonel
Watson: "I think the game is up, and send Mrs Watson, yourself, and
Graham my adieux.We may expect a catastrophe in the town in or after
ten days.This would not have happened (if it does happen) if our
people had taken better precautions as to informing us of their
movements, but this is'spilt milk.'"In face of these documents,
which were in the hands of Sir Charles Wilson on 21st January, it is
impossible to agree with his conclusion in his book "Korti to
Khartoum," that "the delay in the arrival of the steamers at Khartoum
was unimportant" as affecting the result.Every hour, every minute,
had become of vital importance.If the whole Jakdul column had been
destroyed in the effort, it was justifiable to do so as the price of
reinforcing Gordon, so that he could hold out until the main body
under Lord Wolseley could arrive.I am not one of those who think
that Sir Charles Wilson, who only came on the scene at the last
moment, should be made the scapegoat for the mistakes of others in the
earlier stages of the expedition, and I hold now, as strongly as when
I wrote the words, the opinion that, "in the face of what he did, any
suggestion that he might have done more would seem both ungenerous and
untrue."Still the fact remains that on 21st January there was left a
sufficient margin of time to avert what actually occurred at daybreak
on the 26th, for the theory that the Mahdi could have entered the town
one hour before he did was never a serious argument, while the
evidence of Slatin Pasha strengthens the view that Gordon was at the
last moment only overcome by the Khalifa's resorting to a surprise.On
one point of fact Sir Charles Wilson seems also to have been in error.He fixes the fall of Omdurman at 6th January, whereas Slatin, whose
information on the point ought to be unimpeachable, states that it did
not occur until the 15th of that month.When Sir Herbert Stewart had fought and won the battle of Abou Klea,
it was his intention on reaching the Nile, as he expected to do the
next day, to put Sir Charles Wilson on board one of Gordon's own
steamers and send him off at once to Khartoum.The second battle and
Sir Herbert Stewart's fatal wound destroyed that project.But this
plan might have been adhered to so far as the altered circumstances
would allow.Sir Charles Wilson had succeeded to the command, and many
matters affecting the position of the force had to be settled before
he was free to devote himself to the main object of the dash forward,
viz.the establishment of communications with Gordon and Khartoum.As
the consequence of that change in his own position, it would have been
natural that he should have delegated the task to someone else, and in
Lord Charles Beresford, as brave a sailor as ever led a cutting-out
party, there was the very man for the occasion.Unfortunately, Sir
Charles Wilson did not take this step for, as I believe, the sole
reason that he was the bearer of an important official letter to
General Gordon, which he did not think could be entrusted to any other
hands.But for that circumstance it is permissible to say that one
steamer--there was more than enough wood on the other three steamers
to fit one out for the journey to Khartoum--would have sailed on the
morning of the 22nd, the day after the force sheered off from
Metemmah, and, at the latest, it would have reached Khartoum on
Sunday, the 25th, just in time to avert the catastrophe.But as it was done, the whole of the 22nd and 23rd were taken up in
preparing two steamers for the voyage, and in collecting scarlet coats
for the troops, so that the effect of real British soldiers coming up
the Nile might be made more considerable.on Saturday, the
24th, Sir Charles Wilson at last sailed with the two steamers,
_Bordeen_ and _Talataween_, and it was then quite impossible for the
steamers to cover the ninety-five miles to Khartoum in time.Moreover,
the Nile had, by this time, sunk to such a point of shallowness that
navigation was specially slow and even dangerous.The Shabloka
cataract was passed at 3 P.M.on the afternoon of Sunday; then the
_Bordeen_ ran on a rock, and was not got clear till 9 P.M.On the 27th, Halfiyeh, eight miles from Khartoum, was
reached, and the Arabs along the banks shouted out that Gordon was
killed and Khartoum had fallen.Still Sir Charles Wilson went on past
Tuti Island, until he made sure that Khartoum had fallen and was in
the hands of the dervishes.Then he ordered full steam down stream
under as hot a fire as he ever wished to experience, Gordon's black
gunners working like demons at their guns.On the 29th the
_Talataween_ ran on a rock and sank, its crew being taken on board the
_Bordeen_.Two days later the _Bordeen_ shared the same fate, but the
whole party was finally saved on the 4th February by a third steamer,
brought up by Lord Charles Beresford.But these matters, and the
subsequent progress of the Expedition which had so ignominiously
failed, have no interest for the reader of Gordon's life.It failed to
accomplish the object which alone justified its being sent, and, it
must be allowed, that it accepted its failure in a very tame and
spiritless manner.Even at the moment of the British troops turning
their backs on the goal which they had not won, the fate of Gordon
himself was unknown, although there could be no doubt as to the main
fact that the protracted siege of Khartoum had terminated in its
capture by the cruel and savage foe, whom it, or rather Gordon, had so
long defied.I have referred to the official letter addressed to General Gordon, of
which Sir Charles Wilson was the bearer.That letter has never been
published, and it is perhaps well for its authors that it has not
been, for, however softened down its language was by Lord Wolseley's
intercession, it was an order to General Gordon to resign the command
at Khartoum, and to leave that place without a moment's delay.Had it
been delivered and obeyed (as it might have been, because Gordon's
strength would probably have collapsed at the sight of English
soldiers after his long incarceration), the next official step would
have been to censure him for having remained at Khartoum against
orders.Thus would the primary, and, indeed, sole object of the
Expedition have been attained without regard for the national honour,
and without the discovery of that policy, the want of which was the
only cause of the calamities associated with the Soudan.After the 14th of December there is no trustworthy, or at least,
complete evidence, as to what took place in Khartoum.A copy of one of
the defiant messages Gordon used to circulate for the special purpose
of letting them fall into the hands of the Mahdi was dated 29th of
that month, and ran to the effect, "Can hold Khartoum for years."There was also the final message to the Sovereigns of the Powers,
undated, and probably written, if at all, by Gordon, during the final
agony of the last few weeks, perhaps when Omdurman had fallen.It was
worded as follows:--

     "After salutations, I would at once, calling to mind what I have
     gone through, inform their Majesties, the Sovereigns, of the
     action of Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, who appointed me
     as Governor-General of the Soudan for the purpose of appeasing
     the rebellion in that country."During the twelve months that I have been here, these two
     Powers, the one remarkable for her wealth, and the other for her
     military force, have remained unaffected by my situation--perhaps
     relying too much on the news sent by Hussein Pasha Khalifa, who
     surrendered of his own accord."Although I, personally, am too insignificant to be taken into
     account, the Powers were bound, nevertheless, to fulfil the
     engagement upon which my appointment was based, so as to shield
     the honour of the Governments."What I have gone through I cannot describe.The Almighty God
     will help me."Although this copy was not in Gordon's own writing, it was brought
down by one of his clerks, who escaped from Khartoum, and he declared
that the original had been sent in a cartridge case to Dongola.The
style is certainly the style of Gordon, and there was no one in the
Soudan who could imitate it.It seems safe, as Sir Henry Gordon did,
to accept it as the farewell message of his brother.Until fresh evidence comes to light, that of Slatin Pasha, then a
chained captive in the Mahdi's camp, is alone entitled to the
slightest credence, and it is extremely graphic.We can well believe
that up to the last moment Gordon continued to send out
messages--false, to deceive the Mahdi, and true to impress Lord
Wolseley.The note of 29th December was one of the former; the little
French note on half a cigarette paper, brought by Abdullah Khalifa to
Slatin to translate early in January, may have been one of the latter.It said:--"Can hold Khartoum at the outside till the end of January."Slatin then describes the fall of Omdurman on 15th January, with
Gordon's acquiescence, which entirely disposes of the assertion that
Ferratch, the gallant defender of that place during two months, was a
traitor, and of how, on its surrender, Gordon's fire from the western
wall of Khartoum prevented the Mahdists occupying it.He also comments
on the alarm caused by the first advance of the British force into the
Bayuda desert, and of the despatch of thousands of the Mahdi's best
warriors to oppose it.Those forces quitted the camp at Omdurman
between 10th and 15th January, and this step entirely disposes of the
theory that the Mahdi held Khartoum in the hollow of his hand, and
could at any moment take it.As late as the 15th of January, Gordon's
fire was so vigorous and successful that the Mahdi was unable to
retain possession of the fort which he had just captured.The story had best be continued in the words used by the witness.Six
days after the fall of Omdurman loud weeping and wailing filled the
Mahdi's camp.As the Mahdi forbade the display of sorrow and grief it
was clear that something most unusual had taken place.Then it came
out that the British troops had met and utterly defeated the tribes,
with a loss to the Mahdists of several thousands.Within the next two
or three days came news of the other defeat at Abou Kru, and the loud
lamentations of the women and children could not be checked.The Mahdi
and his chief emirs, the present Khalifa Abdullah prominent among
them, then held a consultation, and it was decided, sooner than lose
all the fruits of the hitherto unchecked triumph of their cause, to
risk an assault on Khartoum.At night on the 24th, and again on the
25th, the bulk of the rebel force was conveyed across the river to the
right bank of the White Nile; the Mahdi preached them a sermon,
promising them victory, and they were enjoined to receive his remarks
in silence, so that no noise was heard in the beleaguered city.By
this time their terror of the mines laid in front of the south wall
had become much diminished, because the mines had been placed too low
in the earth, and they also knew that Gordon and his diminished force
were in the last stages of exhaustion.Finally, the Mahdi or his
energetic lieutenant decided on one more arrangement, which was
probably the true cause of their success.The Mahdists had always
delivered their attack half an hour after sunrise; on this occasion
they decided to attack half an hour before dawn, when the whole scene
was covered in darkness.Slatin knew all these plans, and as he
listened anxiously in his place of confinement he was startled, when
just dropping off to sleep, by "the deafening discharge of thousands
of rifles and guns; this lasted for a few minutes, then only
occasional rifle shots were heard, and now all was quiet again.Could
this possibly be the great attack on Khartoum?A wild discharge of
firearms and cannon, and in a few minutes complete silence!"Some hours afterwards three black soldiers
approached, carrying in a bloody cloth the head of General Gordon,
which he identified.It is unnecessary to add the gruesome details
which Slatin picked up as to his manner of death from the gossip of
the camp.In this terrible tragedy ended that noble defence of
Khartoum, which, wherever considered or discussed, and for all time,
will excite the pity and admiration of the world.There is no need to dwell further on the terrible end of one of the
purest heroes our country has ever produced, whose loss was national,
but most deeply felt as an irreparable shock, and as a void that can
never be filled up by that small circle of men and women who might
call themselves his friends.Ten years elapsed after the eventful
morning when Slatin pronounced over his remains the appropriate
epitaph, "A brave soldier who fell at his post; happy is he to have
fallen; his sufferings are over!"before the exact manner of Gordon's
death was known, and some even clung to the chance that after all he
might have escaped to the Equator, and indeed it was not till long
after the expedition had returned that the remarkable details of his
single-handed defence of Khartoum became known.Had all these
particulars come out at the moment when the public learnt that
Khartoum had fallen, and that the expedition was to return without
accomplishing anything, it is possible that there would have been a
demand that no Minister could have resisted to avenge his fate; but it
was not till the publication of the journals that the exact character
of his magnificent defence and of the manner in which he was treated
by those who sent him came to be understood and appreciated by the
nation.The lapse of time has been sufficient to allow of a calm judgment
being passed on the whole transaction, and the considerations which I
have put forward with regard to it in the chronicle of events have
been dictated by the desire to treat all involved in the matter with
impartiality.If they approximate to the truth, they warrant the
following conclusions.The Government sent General Gordon to the
Soudan on an absolutely hopeless mission for any one or two men to
accomplish without that support in reinforcements on which General
Gordon thought he could count.General Gordon went to the Soudan, and
accepted that mission in the enthusiastic belief that he could arrest
the Mahdi's progress, and treating as a certainty which did not
require formal expression the personal opinion that the Government,
for the national honour, would comply with whatever demands he made
upon it.As a simple matter of fact, every one of those demands, some
against and some with Sir Evelyn Baring's authority, were rejected.No
incident could show more clearly the imperative need of definite
arrangements being made even with Governments; and in this case the
precipitance with which General Gordon was sent off did not admit of
him or the Government knowing exactly what was in the other's mind.Ostensibly of one mind, their views on the matter in hand were really
as far as the poles asunder.There then comes the second phase of the question--the alleged
abandonment of General Gordon by the Government which enlisted his
services in face of an extraordinary, and indeed unexampled danger and
difficulty.The evidence, while it proves conclusively and beyond
dispute that Mr Gladstone's Government never had a policy with regard
to the Soudan, and that even Gordon's heroism, inspiration, and
success failed to induce them to throw aside their lethargy and take
the course that, however much it may be postponed, is inevitable, does
not justify the charge that it abandoned Gordon to his fate.It
rejected the simplest and most sensible of his propositions, and by
rejecting them incurred an immense expenditure of British treasure and
an incalculable amount of bloodshed; but when the personal danger to
its envoy became acute, it did not abandon him, but sanctioned the
cost of the expedition pronounced necessary to effect his rescue.This
decision, too late as it was to assist in the formation of a new
administration for the Soudan, or to bring back the garrisons, was
taken in ample time to ensure the personal safety and rescue of
General Gordon.In the literal sense of the charge, history will
therefore acquit Mr Gladstone and his colleagues of the abandonment of
General Gordon personally.With regard to the third phase of the question--viz.the failure of
the attempt to rescue General Gordon, which was essentially a
military, and not a political question--the responsibility passes from
the Prime Minister to the military authorities who decided the scope
of the campaign, and the commander who carried it out.In this case,
the individual responsible was the same.Lord Wolseley not only had
his own way in the route to be followed by the expedition, and the
size and importance attached to it, but he was also entrusted with its
personal direction.There is consequently no question of the
sub-division of the responsibility for its failure, just as there
could have been none of the credit for its success.Lord Wolseley
decided that the route should be the long one by the Nile Valley, not
the short one from Souakim to Berber.Lord Wolseley decreed that there
should be no Indian troops, and that the force, instead of being an
ordinary one, should be a picked special corps from the _elite_ of the
British army; and finally Lord Wolseley insisted that there should be
no dash to the rescue of Gordon by a small part of his force, but a
slow, impressive, and overpoweringly scientific advance of the whole
body.The extremity of Gordon's distress necessitated a slight
modification of his plan, when, with qualified instructions, which
practically tied his hands, Sir Herbert Stewart made his first
appearance at Jakdul.It was then known to Lord Wolseley that Gordon was in extremities,
yet when a fighting force of 1100 English troops, of special physique
and spirit, was moved forward with sufficient transport to enable it
to reach the Nile and Gordon's steamers, the commander's instructions
were such as confined him to inaction, unless he disobeyed his orders,
which only Nelsons and Gordons can do with impunity.It is impossible
to explain this extraordinary timidity.Sir Herbert Stewart reached
Jakdul on 3rd January with a force small in numbers, but in every
other respect of remarkable efficiency, and with the camels
sufficiently fresh to have reached the Nile on 7th or 8th January had
it pressed on.The more urgent news that reached Lord Wolseley after
its departure would have justified the despatch of a messenger to urge
it to press on at all costs to Metemmah.In such a manner would a
Havelock or Outram have acted, yet the garrison of the Lucknow
Residency was in no more desperate case than Gordon at Khartoum.It does not need to be a professor of a military academy to declare
that, unless something is risked in war, and especially wars such as
England has had to wage against superior numbers in the East, there
will never be any successful rescues of distressed garrisons.Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the advance from Korti to Metemmah,
whence his advance guard did not reach the latter place till the 20th,
instead of the 7th of January.His lieutenant and representative, Sir
Charles Wilson, would not risk anything on the 21st January, whence
none of the steamers appeared at Khartoum until late on the 27th, when
all was over.Each of these statements cannot be impeached, and if so,
the conclusion seems inevitable that in the first and highest degree
Lord Wolseley was alone responsible for the failure to reach Khartoum
in time, and that in a very minor degree Sir Charles Wilson might be
considered blameworthy for not having sent off one of the steamers
with a small reinforcement to Khartoum on the 21st January, before
even he allowed Cassim el Mousse to take any part in the attack on
Metemmah.He could not have done this himself, but he would have had
no difficulty in finding a substitute.When, however, there were
others far more blameworthy, it seems almost unjust to a gallant
officer to say that by a desperate effort he might at the very last
moment have snatched the chestnuts out of the fire, and converted the
most ignominious failure in the military annals of this country into a
creditable success.*       *       *       *       *

The tragic end at Khartoum was not an inappropriate conclusion for the
career of Charles Gordon, whose life had been far removed from the
ordinary experiences of mankind.No man who ever lived was called upon
to deal with a greater number of difficult military and
administrative problems, and to find the solution for them with such
inadequate means and inferior troops and subordinates.In the Crimea
he showed as a very young man the spirit, discernment, energy, and
regard for detail which were his characteristics through life.Those
qualities enabled him to achieve in China military exploits which in
their way have never been surpassed.The marvellous skill, confidence,
and vigilance with which he supplied the shortcomings of his troops,
and provided for the wants of a large population at Khartoum for the
better part of a year, showed that, as a military leader, he was still
the same gifted captain who had crushed the Taeping rebellion twenty
years before.What he did for the Soudan and its people during six
years' residence, at a personal sacrifice that never can be
appreciated, has been told at length; but pages of rhetoric would not
give as perfect a picture as the spontaneous cry of the blacks: "If we
only had a governor like Gordon Pasha, then the country would indeed
be contented.""Such examples are fruitful in the future," said Mr Gladstone in the
House of Commons; and it is as a perfect model of all that was good,
brave, and true that Gordon will be enshrined in the memory of the
great English nation which he really died for, and whose honour was
dearer to him than his life.England may well feel proud of having
produced so noble and so unapproachable a hero.She has had, and she
will have again, soldiers as brave, as thoughtful, as prudent, and as
successful as Gordon.She has had, and she will have again, servants
of the same public spirit, with the same intense desire that not a
spot should sully the national honour.But although this breed is not
extinct, there will never be another Gordon.The circumstances that
produced him were exceptional; the opportunities that offered
themselves for the demonstration of his greatness can never fall to
the lot of another; and even if by some miraculous combination the man
and the occasions arose, the hero, unlike Gordon, would be spoilt by
his own success and public applause.But the qualities which made
Gordon superior not only to all his contemporaries, but to all the
temptations and weaknesses of success, are attainable; and the student
of his life will find that the guiding star he always kept before him
was the duty he owed his country.In that respect, above all others,
he has left future generations of his countrymen a great example._Abbas_, steamer, ii.144;

subjective symptoms of syphilitic pharyngitis are those of erythematous
and ulcerative pharyngitis of like grade, except that there is very
little pain.The course is chronic unless specific treatment be
instituted, when prompt repair may be expected unless the general
health has been much undermined.The
manifestations subside under treatment, and recur if it is not
sufficiently prolonged.Complications occur with similar manifestations
of syphilis in adjacent or contiguous or distant structures, as may be.The most frequent sequel in neglected cases is cicatricial stricture.{408} DIAGNOSIS.--Bilateral inflammation in symmetric distribution is
very characteristic of syphilis.Irregular ulcers with undermined
borders and surrounded by inflammatory areolae are similarly
characteristic.Acknowledged history of syphilis or the detection of
syphilitic manifestations elsewhere serves to confirm the diagnosis.In
cases of doubt a few days' treatment with specific remedies in large
doses will almost invariably serve to clear up the diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis as to life is good unless the ulcerations
have become so extensive as to threaten perforation into blood-vessels
or the patient has become greatly debilitated.The prognosis as to
freedom from cicatricial adhesions and stricture is not good in the
presence of lesions which have destroyed large territories of tissue,
even under very careful management.TREATMENT.--Specific medicines in positive doses constitute the most
effectual treatment.Extensive ulcerative tertiary and hereditary lesions are peculiarly
susceptible to large doses (30 to 90 or more grains daily) of potassium
iodide, under the influence of which they often heal without any local
applications whatever.As soon as a positive impression has been
produced the dose may be diminished.The parts should be kept clean and
comfortable by periodic douching with sprays of alkaline solutions, or,
what is still more serviceable, with a ten-volume solution of hydrogen
peroxide diluted with one or more parts of distilled water.The best
local application to the edges of the pharyngeal syphilitic ulcers is
the solid cupric sulphate.Chromic acid (1:8) is a serviceable local
stimulant to indolent ulcers.Necrosed fragments of bone should be
removed.Should any impediment to respiration take place during
administration of the iodides, oedema of the larynx may be suspected,
and should be looked for.Professional supervision is requisite for
many months after the lesions have healed.Cicatricial sequelae of
stricture require surgical interference.{409}

DISEASES OF THE OESOPHAGUS.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--Inflammation of the oesophagus.SYNONYMS.--Inflammatory dysphagia, Inflammation of the gullet.Oesophagitis may be acute or chronic.Either form may be idiopathic,
deuteropathic, or traumatic.DEFINITION.--Acute inflammation of the gullet.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis acuta.HISTORY.--Until the publication in 1829 of a thesis by J. T. Mondiere
entitled _Recherches sur l'Inflammation de l'Oesophage, et sur quelques
points de l'anatomie pathologique de cet organ_, little study had been
devoted to acute inflammation of the oesophagus; and since that time
Mondiere's researches have been largely utilized by subsequent writers.It has been taken for granted that Galen's mention of pain in the
oesophagus[1] has indicated his recognition of the disease.Fernel[2]
mentions phlegmon of the oesophagus; Honkoop[3] describes inflammation
of the oesophagus; J. P. Frank[4] describes an oesophageal angina; and
Joseph Frank[5] seems to have been the first author to use the term
oesophagitis.Since the publication of Mondiere's monograph the
principal systematic descriptions have been those of Hamburger[6] Von
Oppolzer[7] Zenker and Ziemssen[8] Luton,[9] and Bernheim.[10]

Paris, 1877, vol.Encyclopediques des Sciences medicales_, Paris,
1880, vol.ETIOLOGY.--Acute oesophagitis is quite a rare disease.It occurs
idiopathically, deuteropathically, and traumatically--traumatically far
the most {410} frequently, and idiopathically least frequently.It is
doubtful whether any special predisposing causes of oesophagitis can be
indicated.Nevertheless, infancy has been so cited by some authors
(Mondiere, Billard, Behier, and Steffan).Slight idiopathic
catarrhal--or rather erythematous--oesophagitis occasionally ensues in
the adult from sudden or prolonged exposure to cold and moisture, and
under such circumstances may sometimes be regarded as rheumatic in
origin, subsiding after a few hours' continuance, to be immediately
succeeded by manifestations of articular rheumatism, acute or subacute,
as in some analogous examples of rheumatic pharyngitis.Exceptionally,
severe oesophagitis may follow a simple cold (Noveene, cited by
Bernheim), or presents as an extension of sore throat, the result of
cold (Graves[11]).It is induced also by the habitual use of very hot
drinks and food, and occasionally by the opposite extremes, the use of
very cold articles of food and drink (Mondiere, Bourguet, Hamburger).The abuse of tobacco and alcohol is alleged as quite a frequent cause
of mild oesophagitis, usually occurring, however, in association with
pharyngitis from the same causes.Journ._, 1836-37, No.172, and
_Clinical Lectures_, Dublin, 1864, p.Oesophagitis sometimes follows the deglutition of irritating medicines
or moderately caustic poisonous substances not sufficiently acid to
produce veritable traumatic oesophagitis.Mercury, codeina, and
particularly tartar emetic, are cited as capable of exciting
oesophagitis.Large doses of tartar emetic, as formerly administered in pneumonia
(Laennec[12]), sometimes produced a peculiar form of pustulous
oesophagitis, not unlike the pustulous oesophagitis sometimes occurring
as part of the local manifestations of small-pox.[Footnote 12: _Traite de l'Auscultation medicale, etc._, Paris, 1837,
vol.560, illustrated; Laboulbene, _Anatomie pathologique_, and
_Nouveau Dict.370, illustrated;
Von Oppolzer, _op.Deuteropathic catarrhal oesophagitis occurs sometimes as an extension
of catarrhal pharyngitis on the one hand, and of catarrhal gastritis on
the other.It also occurs in scarlet fever, measles, and typhus fever.It is likewise consecutive to the various diseases and surgical lesions
of the tube itself.Parasitic oesophagitis occurs as an extension of
parasitic stomatitis or thrush.Deuteropathic circumscribed phlegmonous
oesophagitis is sometimes produced by extension of inflammation from
softened caseous bronchial glands at the bifurcation of the trachea,
and by pressure from mediastinal tumors, aneurism of the aorta, etc.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is almost always deuteropathic.It has
been encountered chiefly in association with pseudo-membranous
pharyngitis or diphtheria, and with croupous pneumonia, but likewise in
enteric and typhus fever, in cholera and in dysentery, in measles,
scarlatina, and small-pox, in nephritis, tuberculosis, carcinoma, and
pyaemia.In a case of hysteria, to be mentioned later, the entire epithelial
coat of two-thirds of the oesophagus was discharged by emesis.In this
respect the local disease--in that instance at least--resembles
pseudo-membranous enteritis.Traumatic oesophagitis is produced by the deglutition of corrosive
substances, which destroy portions of the mucous membrane in their
passage or excite a suppurative inflammatory process, or is produced by
the {411} passage of foreign bodies of sharp and irregular contour, or
by the passage of surgical appliances, whether used for actual
operations or for explorations merely.In rare cases traumatic oesophagitis is the result of wounds with
firearms or other weapons.Phlegmonous oesophagitis may be the result of disease or injury of the
interior of the oesophagus, or of its external coat by extension of
disease from tissues surrounding it.Foreign bodies, arrested in the
oesophagus or wounding it in their passage to the stomach; injuries
from surgical appliances, exploratory or operative, employed in
treatment for foreign bodies in the tube or in cases of stricture and
morbid growth; and chemical irritants swallowed by accident or
design,--are the chief causes in the former class of cases; but
pustulous and pseudo-membranous oesophagitis must likewise be regarded
as occasional causes.The causes operating upon the exterior of the
tube primarily are suppurative laryngitis and tracheitis, tumefaction
and softening of bronchial and tracheal lymphatic glands, and caries of
the spine.Isolated cases have been attributed to emboli in connection
with valvular diseases of the heart (Parenski, cited by Daton), and to
fits of anger (J. Frank and Rigal, cited by Daton).In certain cases
the cause is unassignable, and is then usually attributed to some
dyscrasia, syphilis in particular.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Acute oesophagitis presents both as a
diffused inflammation and a circumscribed process, annular or irregular
in contour.It does not appear from the post-mortem records consulted
that any special portion of the tube is particularly liable to
circumscribed inflammation, though the lower fourth appears most
frequently affected.The inflammatory process may be simply superficial
or erythematous, catarrhal or desquamative (Zenker and Ziemssen), or it
may be phlegmonous, and thus interest the submucous tissues as well as
the mucous membrane.This may terminate in abscess or in diffuse
suppuration with ulcerations.Both in diphtheria and in croupous pneumonia, pseudo-membranous
oesophagitis is an occasional complication; and the same process is
said to have been observed in typhus fever, measles, scarlatina,
cholera, pyaemia, dysentery, tuberculosis, and carcinoma (Von Oppolzer
and others).Pustulous oesophagitis occurs in small-pox, and occasionally follows
the use of tartar emetic in large doses.The morbid anatomy of acute idiopathic oesophagitis, though usually
detailed in descriptions of the disease, must be known by theory much
more than by demonstration, few examples coming under the inspection of
the pathologist in time to distinguish the progressive stages of the
inflammatory process, and still fewer being revealed by oesophagoscopy
during life.The lesions most frequently observed post-mortem are
thickening, softening, and desquamation of the epithelium, with very
scanty accumulations of viscid mucus here and there upon the mucous
membrane.The mucous membrane is seen to have suffered numbers of
pinhead or slightly larger superficial circumscribed erosions, rounded
or longitudinal, and likewise a few actual ulcerations.The follicles
of the mucous membrane are often both swollen and hypertrophied,
reaching the size of peas, especially in the upper portion of the tube.The desquamation of the epithelium usually takes place in small {412}
patches.One case, however, has been recorded (Birch-Hirschfeld[13]) in
which a young hysterical woman, after suffering three days with acute
oesophagitis without assignable cause, ejected by emesis a membranous
tube two-thirds of the entire length of the oesophagus, and shown under
examination to have been the completely detached epithelial coat of the
oesophagus, wholly normal in its upper layers and infiltrated with
agglomerated round cells in its lower layers.It was supposed that the
mass had been detached in consequence of acute subepithelial
suppuration.[Footnote 13: _Lehrbuch der pathologische Anatomie_, Ziemssen, 1877, p.In addition to swollen and hypertrophied follicles there may be some
evidence of ulcerative destruction of these follicles.Mondiere and
others declare that this folliculous inflammation and ulceration may
exist without any other change whatever in the remaining constituents
of the mucous membrane; and therefore this form of oesophagitis was
termed folliculeuse by Mondiere (folliculous oesophagitis).This form
of the disease has been observed in typhus fever, in croup (Mondiere),
and in tuberculosis.Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs, likewise, in
carcinoma and in oesophagitis from corrosive fluids, wounds, and other
injuries.In pseudo-membranous oesophagitis the exudation occurs usually in small
circumscribed gray-yellow or brownish flakes or stripes distributed
over different portions of the surface, more closely, however, at the
upper portion of the tube.Superficial erosions are sometimes observed
beneath these deposits, and occasionally ulcerations, at times
sufficient to give rise to severe hemorrhage (Zenker and Ziemssen).Usually the mucous membrane is but slightly hyperaemic.In some
instances pseudo-membrane is so massed in plugs as to occlude the
cavity of the tube, as with obturators.In cases associated with
pseudo-membranous gastritis the oesophageal manifestations are greatest
in the vicinity of the cardiac extremity.Somewhat allied to
pseudo-membranous oesophagitis, and apt to be confounded therewith, is
the parasitic deposit of the Oidium albicans in cases of thrush; in
connection with which subject this point has already received
attention.The pustules of small-pox may interest any portion of the mucous
membrane, but are most numerous at the upper portion of the tube.The pustules from tartar-emetic poisoning
are most numerous at the two extremities of the canal.It is contended
that the so-called pustules of variolous oesophagitis are really
superficial variolous ulcers, the antecedent specific lesions having
been lenticular papules merely, with abrasion of the softened
epithelial layer.[14] Variolous oesophagitis may excite an accompanying
catarrhal or pseudo-membranous oesophagitis.The local lesions, be they
pustular or ulcerous, heal without cicatrices.[Footnote 14: _Virchow's Deutsche Klinik_, 1858, No.306; Zenker
and Ziemssen, _op.Phlegmonous oesophagitis presents both as a diffuse and as a
circumscribed inflammation.Examined after death, there is abundant
purulent infiltration into the submucous connective tissue, which has
undergone destruction in portions of its extent.The infiltration
pushes the folds of mucous membrane outward to the interior of the
tube, and thus diminishes its calibre considerably when the
infiltration is annular.{413} The mucous membrane is congested,
ecchymosed, and covered with mucus, and has usually suffered
desquamation of portions of its epithelium.Ulcerations through the
mucous membrane will have taken place in some instances.Cicatrices
mark the location of ulcers which have healed.In the diffuse variety the oesophagus is inflamed and swollen, as a
whole, in proportion to the extent of the disease.In the circumscribed
variety the morbid appearances are circumscribed.It has been known to
continue into the stomach (Belfrage and Hederius, cited by Zenker and
Ziemssen), and to extend therefrom (Ackermann, _idem_).As described by Zenker and Ziemssen, chiefly from ten autopsies by
themselves and one by Belfrage and Hederius, phlegmonous oesophagitis
begins with a submucous purulent infiltration, transforming the areolar
tissue into an apparent layer of pus, although microscopic examination
shows the bundles of connective tissue to be intact at first.At a
later period they become really destroyed, leaving mere crevices filled
with pus.The mucous membrane, but little involved, may remain normal
or may present the evidence of catarrhal inflammation, desquamation of
epithelium, congestion, and slight deposits of mucus.The muscular
coat, intact to the unaided eye, under the microscope gives some
evidence of purulent infiltrations.The pus may finally escape through
the mucous membrane, in extensive infiltrations, at several points,
which give the parts a sieve-like appearance when the perforations are
closely grouped.Gangrene sometimes occurs as a result of intense phlegmonous
oesophagitis, but this is far more rare than the gangrene supervening
after injuries by caustic substances.Sometimes it results from
capillary embolism (Rokitansky, Virchow, cited by Luton, _op.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATION, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The main subjective symptoms of oesophagitis are pain and
difficulty in swallowing, with febrile phenomena superadded in severe
cases.In simple oesophagitis of mild character these symptoms may be
so slight as to be attributed to other causes or be disregarded
altogether.In most instances there is a dull, steady pain beneath the
sternum, some sense of impediment to deglutition or absolute pain in
swallowing (odynphagia), and occasional regurgitation of viscid, glairy
mucus, food, or acid products from the stomach.In severe cases the
substernal pain is more acute and more diffused, and is frequently
associated with pain between the scapulae and to the left side.This
latter pain may be attributable to acid from the stomach.Sometimes the
pain is described as acute, especially during the passage of large
boluses, particularly if they are very hot, or even very cold.The seat
of pain, however, does not always indicate the seat of inflammation,
even though the pain be always referred to the same locality.When the
cervical portion of the tube is implicated, tenderness may sometimes be
detected by external pressure or by special movements of the head and
vertebrae.The amount and character of the dysphagia vary greatly.Sometimes there
is a sense of impediment to the passage of food, solid or liquid, or
solid only, through and beyond the painful region.This sensation may
be accompanied or be followed at a brief interval by regurgitation of
food or mucus, or food enveloped with mucus, the latter in some
instances tinged with blood.The deglutition or the regurgitation may
be {414} accompanied by spasm of the muscular coat of the oesophagus.The dysphagia is not always due to tumefaction of the mucous membrane,
but usually in part to coexisting inflammation of the muscular coat or
infiltration between the sheaths of muscular fibres, paralyzing their
efforts at contraction.There are no subjective symptoms which permit discrimination between
desquamative catarrhal oesophagitis and folliculous oesophagitis.The
only symptom particularly indicating pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is
the expulsion of shreds of the membrane by hawking or by emesis; but a
strong inference is justifiable when the ordinary symptoms of
oesophagitis occur in cases of pseudo-membranous pharyngitis or
croupous pneumonia.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is indicated by the presence of pus or of dead
mucous membrane in the matter regurgitated or vomited.In severe cases
there is considerable febrile reaction.In children, convulsions may
supervene from reflex irritation conveyed along the pneumogastric
nerve.The course of acute catarrhal oesophagitis is, as a rule, short, the
pain and dysphagia usually subsiding in a few days, with complete
resolution and no unfavorable sequelae.When due to obstruction, the
course is indefinitely prolonged.Sometimes it subsides into a mild or
unsuspected chronic oesophagitis.In the symptomatic oesophagitis of
febrile diseases, the course is longer and unequal.In severer forms
and in phlegmonous oesophagitis, the disease may be protracted by
suppuration, abscess, gangrene, perforation of the oesophagus, and
other complications.It often terminates fatally--in three or four days
in some cases--sometimes under symptoms of collapse.Cases may recover
without important sequelae, but stricture very often results from
cicatricial complications.Chronic oesophagitis is a more frequent
sequel of the phlegmonous variety than of the catarrhal.It, in its
turn, may give rise to dilatation of the oesophagus, annular or
diverticular, from detention of food and consequent pressure.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest upon the interpretation of the
coexistence of a certain number of the symptoms mentioned.Idiopathic
phlegmonous oesophagitis may readily be mistaken for dorsal myelitis by
the location of the pain--the more so that the spinal disease is
occasionally attended with spasm of the oesophagus, and the myelitis by
difficulty in deglutition; but the differentiation may be determined by
the inability to produce oesophageal pain by pressure made along the
dorsal vertebrae.In deuteropathic or traumatic phlegmonous
oesophagitis, the history of the attack will indicate the probable
nature of the malady, and prevent the mistake.Diffused oesophagitis is
suspected when the general pain or the painful dysphagia appears to
extend along the entire tract of the oesophagus, or at least a large
portion of it.Circumscribed oesophagitis is usually indicated by odynphagia at a
certain point of the tube after completing the act of deglutition.The
location of the inflammation can sometimes be determined by
auscultation of the descent of the alimentary bolus or of a swallow of
water (Hamburger), which may yield evidence to the ear of arrest or
impediment to its passage.Auscultation of the oesophagus, however, is
less useful in acute oesophagitis than in stenosis, stricture, and
mechanical obstruction.When available in oesophagitis, the normal
sound of the passage of water down {415} the gullet becomes masked, and
accompanied by that of regurgitative ascent of small bubbles of air.Sometimes there is a slight friction sound during the act of
deglutition itself.In circumscribed oesophagitis, especially when
annular, as is most frequently the case, sounds are heard attributable
to marked obstruction to the descent of the bolus.Abscess cannot be
positively diagnosticated until after its rupture and the appearance of
pus in the matters regurgitated or otherwise expelled from the
oesophagus.Catheterism of the oesophagus is hardly justifiable as a method of
diagnosticating oesophagitis, though proper enough when it becomes
important to determine the locality of attendant obstruction.It is important that inflammation of the oesophagus be differentiated
from spasm, stricture, stenosis, carcinoma, and other oesophageal
maladies; nearly all of which present the same main subjective
symptoms--pain and impediment to deglutition.The history of the case
is in itself a guide of great diagnostic value, often quite sufficient
for the purpose; but in its absence or retention other data must be
gathered.Spasm of the oesophagus is most frequent in neurotic subjects.It
is not a febrile affection.It is often overcome in a moment by
catheterization.Stricture presents often an additional symptom of oesophagitis, the
regurgitation of mucus and food.The differentiation is made, in cases
of doubt, by the passage of the bougie or catheter.Carcinoma of the oesophagus, while recent, may present much similitude
to oesophagitis, but as the case advances, the glandular involvements,
the cachexia, the expulsion of cancerous fragments, and the vomiting of
blood seem sufficient to prevent further confusion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is favorable in acute catarrhal oesophagitis,
the manifestations often subsiding within a few days; sometimes,
indeed, within a few hours, and that, too, without special medication.It is therefore largely dependent on the cause of the oesophagitis and
the severity and extent of the malady.The only unfavorable
prognostications arise from the impediment to nourishment and the
complications which may ensue.In presumptive pustulous oesophagitis from the use of preparations of
antimony, the manifestations usually subside within a few days upon
suspension of the remedy.Sometimes, however, these cases terminate
fatally.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is usually fatal in its significance,
and the same may be said of the pustulous or ulcero-papular
oesophagitis of small-pox.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is of grave augury, though many cases recover.It may prove fatal within two or three days, though life is usually
prolonged for several days, even in fatal cases.When not fatal,
abscesses are apt to form, which, discharging internally or externally,
are followed by stricture or fistulae.Both ulcerative oesophagitis and intense catarrhal oesophagitis may
terminate in chronic thickening of the walls of the oesophagus and in
cicatricial adhesions more or less extensive.TREATMENT.--Mild oesophagitis requires no special treatment.The
patient should be kept within doors, and be fed on rice-water, {416}
barley-water, and other mucilaginous articles of diet, so as to avoid
all sources of local irritation.These drinks are usually better borne
hot than cold, but sometimes cold is quite agreeable.When cold can be
well borne the frequent deglutition of pellets of ice is useful as well
as agreeable, and ice-cream becomes a medicinal article of diet.In severe cases the measures indicated become still more requisite, and
the use of the voice should be restrained in addition.All unnecessary
efforts at deglutition should be avoided, and anodyne medicaments
(opium, hyoscyamus, belladonna) should be added to the demulcent food
or beverages.When swallowing is impracticable or very painful,
nutriment should be given by the bowel, and medicines by the bowel or
by the skin.Thirst may be allayed by retaining fragments of ice in the
mouth from time to time, by rinsing the mouth with simple or acidulated
water, by sucking the juice of acid fruits, or by allowing compressed
effervescent lozenges to dissolve slowly in the mouth.The external application of cold compresses, continuously or in
frequent renewals, is also indicated.Febrile phenomena require ordinary antiphlogistic medication.When this
is impracticable, the indications may be met by using the cold bath or
the wet sheet, and by administering antipyretics hypodermatically.Traumatic oesophagitis from a foreign body requires removal of the
object if still in the oesophagus; that from swallowing alkalies is met
by the use of acidulated beverages (vinegar and water, Orfila); that
from swallowing acids, by the use of alkaline drinks, of which the
handiest is usually soap and water.As soon as they can be procured
this may be changed for lime-water and calcined magnesia.Theoretically, the carbonates of the alkalies are indicated likewise,
but it is contended (Hamburger, Oppolzer) that the extrication of the
carbonic acid gas renders mechanical rupture of the corroded oesophagus
imminent.Subsequently, fresh water should be freely drunk, or be
injected into the oesophagus when swallowing is impracticable.The
subsequent treatment is to be instituted upon general principles.DEFINITION.--A chronic inflammation of some of the tissues of the
oesophagus.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis chronica.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic oesophagitis is sometimes a sequel of the acute
affection.More frequently it is the result of excessive use of strong
alcoholic beverages or of very hot drinks.It is said to be sometimes
the result of passive congestion in chronic pulmonary and cardiac
diseases.It follows the prolonged sojourn of foreign bodies in the
oesophagus.It exists in connection with carcinoma of the oesophagus,
with dilatation, and with stricture of the oesophagus, and with other
diseases obstructing the tube externally or internally.It is sometimes
produced by caries of the vertebrae, both scrofulous and syphilitic,
and by the pressure of aneurismal and other tumors.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of
the oesophagus, of the submucous connective tissue, and {417} even of
the muscular coat, are the processes which take place in chronic
oesophagitis, especially when it has been of long continuance.This
hypertrophy, when at or near the cardiac extremity, may produce
stricture (Rokitansky and others), with subsequent dilatation of the
oesophagus from its frequent and prolonged distension by food which
should have passed on at once into the stomach.On post-mortem examination the main evidences of disease are most
frequent in the lower third of the organ.Its folds of mucous membrane
are thick and prominent, dirty red, brownish-red, or gray, as may be,
abraded here and there, and covered with viscid muco-purulent
secretions.Abscesses and ulceration are not uncommon in cases due to
prolonged pressure or extension of disease from outside the tube.Such
ulceration has not uncommonly been the source of serious hemorrhage.Diffuse inflammation of the peri- or retro-oesophageal connective
tissue has been noted as an occasional sequel to the inflammatory
process in the walls of the oesophagus.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, ETC.--The symptoms of simple chronic oesophagitis are
similar in the main to those of mild acute oesophagitis, but are often
still more moderate, and therefore likely to be overlooked.In severe
cases the symptoms are chiefly those of the disease, usually stenotic,
which has excited the chronic inflammatory process.The course is
prolonged and the duration indefinite.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests on the same principles and inferences
as in acute oesophagitis, the symptoms, however, being of longer
duration.The auscultatory signs of arrest or impediment in the descent
of the solid or liquid bolus are usually more definite than in acute
oesophagitis.The same differentiations are available in excluding
spasm, stricture, and malignant diseases.The use of the sound or
catheter is much more justifiable than in the acute variety.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually unfavorable, on account of the
great liability to stricture and occlusion from organization of
inflammatory products.TREATMENT.--Chronic oesophagitis may require both local and
constitutional treatment.The constitutional treatment will have to be
adapted to the cause of the disease.If due to obstructed circulation
in consequence of valvular disease of the heart, digitalis and remedies
of its class will be indicated.If due to obstructive pulmonic disease,
chloride of ammonium and alkaline remedies will be indicated.Syphilitic inflammation requires the mixed treatment, with mercuric
chloride and potassium iodide or their equivalent.Iodides, indeed, are
often required in non-specific cases, and are useful particularly in
ordinary circumscribed oesophagitis.Under all conditions alcoholic
beverages should be interdicted, and so should the deglutition of all
irritating food and drink.Mild, bland, and mucilaginous substances
should be largely employed in food and drink.The copious use of
carbonic-acid waters is also recommended (Oppolzer).Sinapisms and
revulsives to the side of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae are also
recommended by some writers (Oppolzer).The topical treatment consists in the systematic use every few days of
aqueous solutions of astringents (alum, tannin, ten to thirty grains to
the ounce) or alterants (compound solution of iodine, twenty minims to
the {418} ounce) passed gently over the diseased surfaces by means of a
piece of soft surgical sponge securely attached to a flexible staff.Severe pain of rather sudden occurrence is usually attributable to
circumscribed ulceration, and is best treated by superficial
cauterization, as above, with a dilute solution of silver nitrate (ten
grains to the ounce).These remedies may be used in the form of
ointments of the same strength smeared upon a rather large flexible
bougie.To relieve pain and sense of constriction belladonna or
stramonium ointment, applied in the same manner, sometimes fulfils a
useful indication.Before making these applications attempts should be
made by auscultation to locate the seat of disease or obstruction.After subsidence of the disease, occasional catheterization may be
practised at intervals of several weeks, in order to detect any
recommencing stenosis.Ulcerations of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Circumscribed destruction of portions of the mucous
membrane of the oesophagus, the result of inflammatory processes.ETIOLOGY.--Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs as a result of
inflammation of the organ, as discussed in connection with
Oesophagitis, and the cause varies with the character of the
oesophagitis, whether idiopathic, traumatic, or symptomatic of disease
elsewhere.Diseases, constitutional or local, provocative of ulceration
of the oesophagus, usually implicate some portion of either the
alimentary or the respiratory tract.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms are in the main those described under
Acute Oesophagitis, particularly the expulsion of sanguinolent products
or of unmixed blood.Perforation into the trachea is indicated by
expectoration of food or drink; perforation into the great vessels, by
haematemesis, usually fatal; and perforation into the mediastinum, by
emphysema and purulent cellulitis.When large or extensive ulcerations
have cicatrized they occasion symptoms of organic stricture.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Referring to the corresponding section
under Oesophagitis, attention may be directed here to the liability of
deep-seated ulcers of the oesophagus to perforate the gullet and
establish fistulae with the trachea, bronchi, mediastinum, aorta, and
carotid artery, according to the locality of the lesion.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in matters regurgitated or vomited
forms the chief diagnostic indication of ulceration of the oesophagus,
taken in connection with the usual symptoms of acute or chronic
oesophagitis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is altogether dependent on the nature of the
disease which has given rise to the ulceration.TREATMENT.--The constitutional treatment will depend on the nature of
the disease which has occasioned ulceration.Ergot and turpentine are
administered in case of hemorrhage--the former best, perhaps,
hypodermatically.Attempts are sometimes made to cauterize the ulcer or
ulcers with nitrate-of-silver stick conveyed in a covered slotted
canula, to be exposed when the fenestrum reaches the ulcerated
locality, previously {419} determined by catheterization, or inferred
to be reached by the sensations of the patient.The practice is
uncertain in its manipulation and questionable in its results.Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A constriction of the calibre of the oesophagus, whether
spasmodic or organic in character.This definition excludes stenosis
due to pressure from without.Spasmodic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A contraction of the muscles of the oesophagus, of
variable duration, causing partial or complete stenosis of the gullet
and interfering with the passage of food or of food and drink to the
stomach.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagismus, Spasm of the oesophagus, Cramp of the
oesophagus, Convulsive dysphagia, Spasmodic dysphagia, Spasmodic
stenosis of the oesophagus, <DW46> stricture of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--On this subject there is little of importance in medical
annals previous to the observations of Frederick Hoffmann,[15] and
little of importance subsequently save the observations of
Mondiere,[16] though numerous personal observations are on record, as
well as a number of excellent compilations in various monographs,
text-books, encyclopaedias, and dictionaries.[Footnote 15: _De spasmo gulae inferioris_, Halae, 1733; _De morbis
oesophagi spasmodicis_, Opera omnia, vol.[Footnote 16: "Recherches sur l'Oesophagisme ou Spasme de l'Oesophage,"
_Arch.ETIOLOGY.--Spasmodic stricture of the oesophagus is a neurosis often
hysterical.It is much more frequent in females than in males, and,
although observed in young subjects and less frequently in old ones, is
most common between the ages of twenty and fifty.It is sometimes
observed in several members of a neurotic family.It is often
associated with other evidences of neurosis, but sometimes constitutes
the sole manifestation.Sometimes
it can be traced to a fear of strangulation, induced primarily by some
accidental impediment to deglutition or the entrance of a foreign body.Strong mental emotion, such as the dread of hydrophobia after having
been bitten by a dog, sometimes produces the affection.It occurs in connection with organic lesions of the oesophagus, organic
lesions of the stomach, organic lesions of the larynx and trachea, and
organic lesions of the lungs, heart, large blood-vessels, and
perioesophageal tissues, but likewise as a reflex disorder, with
lesions of distant organs, as the genito-urinary tract, the intestines,
the brain and spinal cord.Even pregnancy may produce reflex
oesophagismus.It sometimes occurs as a direct or reflex manifestation
of gout and of rheumatism.In a few instances it occurs as one of the
manifestations of tetanus and of hydrophobia.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, ETC.--The spasm may affect {420} the
oesophagus only, or may be associated with spasm of the muscles of the
pharynx.It is usually manifested in a sudden inability to swallow or
to complete the acts of deglutition.This may be transitory or may
continue for a number of hours.The relaxation of the spasm is
sometimes followed by the discharge of flatus and the copious secretion
of pale urine.The spasm may recur at irregular intervals or be more or
less distinctly intermittent.Sometimes it precedes every effort at
deglutition.In some instances it occurs only upon attempts to swallow
certain kinds of food, and the articles of food vary with different
patients.Cold viands sometimes produce spasm when warm and hot food is
tolerated.Consciousness of a liability to spasm increases the
dysphagia for the time being, or brings it on suddenly when this
liability had been forgotten.The spasm is sometimes painless and
sometimes painful.In some instances it is associated with partial
regurgitation of a mass of air (the globus hystericus).The dysphagia is rarely complete, instances in which no liquids can be
swallowed being infrequent.The aliment swallowed usually passes on
into the stomach, upon relaxation of the spasm, after a certain period
of detention varying from a number of seconds to many minutes.In cases
of prolonged or persistent spasm the aliment is usually rejected,
either at once or after a time, according as the contraction takes
place at the pharyngeal extremity of the oesophagus or lower down.When
rejected after some detention in the gullet, the aliments are usually
enveloped with mucus or followed by expulsion of mucus and of flatus.In some subjects the pain in swallowing is severe.Sometimes it is
associated with spasm of the diaphragm (hiccough), spasm of the
air-passages, palpitation of the heart, and syncope.The liability to spasm sometimes continues for years.Sometimes it
ceases permanently as suddenly and as unexpectedly as it began.The seat of the spasm is referred by the patient to different regions,
which in their totality comprise the entire extent of the oesophagus.In some patients the seat varies on different occasions.The actual
seat of any individual spasm is best determined by exploration with the
oesophageal bougie or by auscultating the oesophagus during the passage
of a bolus.It is most frequent perhaps at the upper extremity, and
then perhaps at the cardiac extremity.When habitually low down, there
is some liability to permanent distension of the oesophagus from
repeated retentions of food at the same place for hours together.In
some instances food is regurgitated from the oesophagus after its
retention for a day or even longer.When the spasm is high up, the
regurgitation may follow the act of deglutition almost immediately.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The affection being usually a pure
neurosis, there is no oesophageal lesion to be cited.In some of the
few autopsies recorded, constriction has been noted without lesion of
tissue.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis is based on the sudden onset of the spasm
without assignable cause, its intermittent or recurrent character, its
manifestation in advance of the effort at deglutition, the symptoms of
regurgitation, the coexistence of some of the affections mentioned in
connection with its etiology, and on the satisfactory result of
exploration with the oesophageal bougie; which differentiates the
affection from organic stricture or mechanical obstruction.In
catheterization of the oesophagus {421} in cases of pure spasm,
although the sound is usually arrested at the seat of constriction, it
passes onward after a few moments by sudden relaxation of the spasm.Sometimes, indeed, the very first manipulation of this kind overcomes
the spasm permanently.In the absence of other indications the differentiation from spasm of
organic origin rests, in great measure, on the conservation of
nutrition, cases being few in which the spasm is persistent enough to
interfere so materially with the ingestion of aliment as to produce
emaciation.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually favorable in spasm of the
oesophagus, except in cases where the underlying malady is itself a
grave one.Patients do not die of neurotic spasm of the oesophagus.In
the majority of cases it is susceptible of cure within a few weeks,
sometimes much more promptly.Even when it continues for months or for
years there is little fear of permanent injury to the general health,
inasmuch as sufficient nutriment of some kind or other can be ingested
to sustain the patient.The duration of the affection depends upon the surroundings of the
patient, his amenability to treatment, and the existence or absence of
disease in the oesophagus or elsewhere.In cases dependent upon
diseased conditions in the oesophagus or elsewhere the character of the
disease controls the prognosis, both immediate and ultimate.Thus,
aneurism of the aorta, tuberculosis, ulceration of the larynx and
trachea, carcinoma of the stomach, tetanus, and hydrophobia present the
highest unfavorable indications.Purely neurotic cases are extremely
prone to recurrence.TREATMENT.--The treatment to be pursued will depend upon the nature of
the case.If due to organic lesion in the oesophagus or in some other
organ, the treatment will be directed to that affection, whatever it
may be.If due to emotional disturbance, therapeutic efforts will be
directed to their suppression or removal.If purely hysterical,
appropriate constitutional remedies for that condition will be
prescribed.These comprise asafoetida, valerian, camphor, musk, oxide
of zinc, bromides, belladonna, conium, and so on, best administered in
small doses at frequent intervals.Local treatment is almost always necessary, both for its beneficial
mechanical effects and for its emotional influence.This consists in
the systematic passage of the bougie; and it is by far the best
practice to insist upon the patient's submission to it without an
anaesthetic.In cases of intense hyperaesthesia, which are rare, and in
the initial exploratory passage of the instrument in highly excitable
or uncontrollable subjects, anaesthesia may be resorted to if there be
no contraindication.The mere passage of the bougie will often effect
immediate relaxation of the spasm.When required, the manipulation may
be repeated a few times at intervals of several days.Should the
passage of the bougie determine the stricture to be purely spasmodic,
the patient should be made to partake of food in the physician's
presence at first, and afterward under the supervision of an efficient
attendant, until it becomes evident that there is no absolute
impediment to the passage of food.The presence of the physician during
early attempts at taking ordinary food imparts such confidence in the
patient that he soon overcomes his dread of strangling and learns to
eat again as he should do.Meantime, it may be necessary from time to
time to pass the bougie just before food is taken.{422} In such cases
it is well to smear the instrument with ointment of belladonna, so as
to deposit it more or less along the entire tract of the oesophagus.Failing by these methods, success may follow the occasional passage, at
intervals of a few days, of a sponge probang saturated with a very weak
solution of iodine or of silver nitrate.Counter-irritation along the course of the pneumogastric nerve or along
the spine is sometimes useful.Electricity is sometimes employed to overcome the spasm; but
intra-oesophageal electrization of every kind is risky from the danger
of exciting fatal syncope from irritation of the pneumogastric nerve.This objection is not applicable to percutaneous electrization, save in
a much more limited degree.Caution is requisite even with external
manipulations along the tract of the pneumogastric nerve; and such
manipulations, therefore, should not be undertaken without sufficient
familiarity with the effects of electric currents in that situation.Taken all in all, the best results seem to follow the systematic use of
the bougie and enforced deglutition under the eye of an attendant in
whom the patient feels reliance can be placed in case the food should
"go the wrong way" or become impacted in the gullet.Organic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Diminution in the calibre of the oesophagus in consequence
of organic alterations in its walls, whether interstitial, cicatricial,
or malignant.SYNONYM.--Stenosis of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--As mentioned in connection with other affections of the
oesophagus, so with organic stricture: though much more has been
written on the subject, it is to the observations and publications of
Mondiere, so frequently cited, that we must credit medical literature
with a due appreciation of this topic.The last thirty years especially
have been prolific in the record of cases, and their study has been
further stimulated by the attention directed to the operation of
gastrostomy as a means of prolonging life in cases otherwise hopelessly
fatal.ETIOLOGY.--Organic stricture of the oesophagus is occasionally
congenital.As a rule, life is rarely prolonged under such conditions,
but cases are on record in which it has been preserved to quite
advanced age.Thus, in a female who died from inanition at fifty-nine
years of age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture (Everard Homes[17]),
there was an annular stricture behind the first ring of the trachea;
and in a male subject who died with pneumonia at seventy-four years of
age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture,[18] the stricture was found
at the cardiac extremity of the oesophagus, which was enormously
dilated its entire length above the constriction.Encyclopedique_, t. xiv.[Footnote 18: Wilks, _Path.130; Holmes, _The
Surgical Treatment of the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood_, 2d ed.,
p.In the majority of cases the stricture is due to cicatricial
obliteration of more or less of the calibre of the oesophagus, the
result of losses of substance following scalds produced by caustic
substances swallowed, mostly by accident and sometimes by design.Wounds of all kinds, {423} whether from the interior, as in the case of
foreign bodies and instruments of extraction, or from the exterior, as
in the case of surgical operations, wounds from firearms, and the like,
are apt in their cicatrization to give rise to this form of stricture.Though denied by some authorities, syphilitic disease of the oesophagus
is an undoubted cause of stricture.Setting aside disputed records of
older authorities, we may cite recent cases reported by Lancereaux,
West,[19] Wilks, Virchow, and Lublinski,[20] the latter-named going
deeply into the bibliography, pathology, and therapeutics of stricture
from syphilis.The author could add his personal testimony were it
requisite.[Footnote 19: _The Lancet_, 1872.]20, 1883; _London Medical
Record_, Nov.Stricture of the oesophagus is likewise occasioned by the presence of
papillomatous, fibroid, and other morbid growths.Carcinoma is quite a
frequent cause.The frequent deglutition of undiluted spirituous liquors is said to
give occasion at times to stricture of the oesophagus, but in these
instances this result is usually due to precedent chronic oesophagitis
thereby excited, and terminating in infiltration and hyperplasia of the
submucous connective tissue, and sometimes great thickening of the
epithelium as well.Males are more frequently the subjects of stricture of the oesophagus,
and early adult life the most frequent period for its occurrence,
though it may present at any age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Except in traumatic cases, the earliest symptoms,
preceded in some instances by indications of mild oesophagitis, perhaps
unnoticed or unrecognized, are occasional impediments to deglutition of
large and firm boluses, or rather a mechanical obstacle to completion
of the act of glutition occurring at intervals of a few meals or a few
days.After a while the swallowing of a large solid bolus becomes
permanently impracticable.Then, sometimes, repeated efforts become
necessary to swallow small masses of solid food; and even to do this
may require external manipulation, or at least the additional pressure
of liquids swallowed immediately after the solid bolus.These efforts
are sometimes attended with spasm, regurgitation, and pain, and may be
accompanied in addition with tracheal dyspnoea, and with nervousness in
consequence.As the disease progresses it becomes impossible to swallow
solid food, and subsequently even fluid food in extreme cases.The
bolus is then often regurgitated immediately after its deglutition, and
may be covered with mucus, blood, pus, or fragments or detritus of
ulcerated malignant growth, according to the nature of the case.Pain
and sensations of rawness are often felt at the point of constriction,
whence the pain often radiates toward one or both scapulae.If the tube
is much dilated above the stricture, the food may be detained in the
sac for several hours, and then be regurgitated in a softened,
partially-decomposed condition.Should the mass be so situated as to
compress the trachea, suffocative symptoms may be produced.In stricture due to organic disease there may be dysphonia from
pressure or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve producing paralysis
of the vocal band.The anatomical relations of the left recurrent nerve
renders it the much more liable of the two to become implicated.Moderate dyspnoea may result from this paralysis by reason of the
reduced space of the glottis.{424} PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Organic stricture of the
oesophagus is usually due to disease or structural change involving the
mucous membrane and submucous connective tissue; but the muscular
structure may become involved likewise.It may, however, be due to
abnormal laxity of the mucous membrane, permitting a fold to occupy a
position impeding the passage of the bolus.In cases which are not carcinomatous the diminution in the actual
calibre of the tube is usually due to submucous proliferation of
connective tissue and to thickening of the mucous membrane.The
encroachment on the calibre of the tube may be quite slight, or may be
so great as to amount to almost complete occlusion.The seat of stricture is at the upper portion of the oesophagus most
frequently, then at the cardiac extremity, at the point of crossing by
the left bronchus, and at the point of passage through the
diaphragm--all localities slightly constricted normally--but it may
occur at any portion.There may, however, be two,
three, or even four strictures.Multiple strictures are most common
after deglutition of caustic substances which have made their way clear
down into the stomach.Syphilitic strictures are usually single, and so, as a rule, are
strictures of malignant origin.Cicatricial strictures from caustic substances may be in the form of
bands, rings, or longitudinal stripes or folds.Sometimes they are
quite extensive, and have been known to interest fully one-third of the
length of the oesophagus.The circumference, length, calibre, and
thickness of the stricture, however, vary within the most extreme
limits.Occasionally occlusion of the tube is complete.The detention of food above the stricture usually dilates the
oesophagus, producing hypertrophy of the mucous membrane and submucous
connective tissue, followed in its turn by fatty degeneration.Atrophy
of the oesophagus may ensue below the stricture if at all tight, and
the mucous membrane becomes thrown into longitudinal folds.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of organic stricture of the oesophagus rarely
presents difficulty.Dysphagia, spasm, and regurgitation are quite
characteristic of stricture.When the constriction is high up, the
vomiting or regurgitation of food may closely follow its deglutition;
when low down, this act may be delayed ten or fifteen minutes, in some
cases for hours.Alkaline reaction of the vomited matters is indicative
of their having failed to reach the stomach.The presence of
blood-cells, pus-cells, and cancer-cells indicates ulceration,
suppuration, and malignant disease, respectively.Auscultation of the oesophagus during deglutition of water will
indicate the seat of stricture by revealing the ascent of consecutive
air-bubbles even when palpation with bougies fails.The passage of
oesophageal bougies or the stomach-tube into the oesophagus will often
reveal the point of stricture.Its length is estimated by the distance
of the resistance offered to the passage of the instrument; its
diameter, by the size of the largest instrument which can be passed
through it; and its consistence, by the character of the resistance.Care is requisite in manipulating with these instruments, lest by undue
exertion of force they be passed through an ulcerated portion of the
wall of the tube or {425} a diverticulum.The character of the
resistance is sometimes the sole means of differentiating stricture
from stenosis due to compression of the oesophageal wall from its
outside.It sometimes happens, in individuals with impaired sensitiveness of the
epiglottis or vestibule of the larynx, that the exploratory bougie is
introduced into the air-passage instead of the gullet.The usual
premonitory phenomena of suffocation will indicate the mistake.There
is some likelihood, too, of entering the larynx in individuals with
unusually prominent cervical vertebrae and in cases of stricture at the
extreme upper portion of the oesophagus.In introducing these
instruments into the oesophagus, therefore, it is well that they be
guided along the fore finger of the disengaged hand, and passed deeply
into the throat, either to the side of the larynx or behind it.By
keeping to the side and reaching the oesophagus by way of the
laryngo-pharyngeal sinus the risk of entering the larynx may be
avoided.Before introducing the tube the case should be carefully
examined for aneurism, which by pressure sometimes gives rise to the
ordinary subjective symptoms of stricture.Should aneurism be detected,
passage of the tube would be hazardous.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is in most instances unfavorable.It is
comparatively favorable in cases of moderate stricture due to causes
apparently remediable.The extent and volume of the stricture progress
more or less slowly according to the nature of its cause, and in
non-malignant cases, such as are due to the action of caustic
substances, it may last for years before the patient, if not relieved,
succumbs, as he does, from gradual inanition.In the earlier stages,
before the hypertrophied muscles above the stricture undergo fatty
metamorphosis, the increased muscular power is sufficient to force
nourishment through the stricture; but when this becomes no longer
possible progressive marasmus must ensue.Meantime, abscess may become
developed in consequence of the pressure of retained food, and
tuberculous degeneration of the lung and local gangrene may take place
in consequence of the malnutrition.TREATMENT.--The treatment of organic stricture of the oesophagus
resolves itself into maintenance of the general health, the
administration of the iodides to promote absorption of effusions into
the connective tissue or the muscles, mechanical and operative measures
for removal of the causes of the constriction or the strictured tissues
themselves, and operations for securing artificial openings below the
point of stricture for the introduction of nourishment (oesophagostomy
and gastrostomy).Nourishment by enema is of great value.In carcinomatous stricture local measures are in the main
unjustifiable, as they usually entail injury which may prove very
serious.Arsenic internally is thought to <DW44> the progress of
malignant disease when administered early and persistently.Morphine is
used hypodermically to assuage pain.In cancerous and tuberculous disease great caution is requisite in
determining upon mechanical or surgical procedures.In cicatricial
stenosis from the effects of caustic substances, such measures may be
undertaken with much less consideration.The local treatment consists in systematic mechanical dilatation with
bougies or mechanical dilators properly constructed.These are employed
{426} daily, every other day, or at more prolonged intervals, according
to the tolerance of the parts and the progressive improvement.They are
retained several moments at each introduction, and followed by the
passage and immediate withdrawal of an instrument of larger size.It is
often advisable that the final dilatation of each series be made with a
stomach-tube, so that liquid food may be poured through it from a
syphon or a small-lipped vessel, that there may be no necessity for
swallowing food for some hours thereafter.This method is continued
until it becomes evident that nothing further is to be gained by its
continuance.In cases that have been at all successful, the
introduction of the instrument should be repeated every week or two for
a long time, to prevent or <DW44> recurrence of the constriction, which
is very liable to take place.M. Krishaber has reported[21] cases in
which a tube passed through the nose was retained from forty to three
hundred and five days; and from this success he deduces the
practicability of continuous dilatation in this manner.Billroth and
Rokitansky have encountered cases in which frequent dilatation had set
up inflammation of the surrounding connective tissue, which had caused
fatal pleurisy by continuity.Congress_, London, 1881, vol.Forcible dilatation by mechanical separation of the sides of a double
metallic sound has been employed with success in some instances.Destruction of cicatricial tissue by caustics has been attempted, and,
though successes occasionally attend the practice, it is hardly
considered sufficiently promising.Division of the stricture by internal oesophagotomy, with subsequent
dilatation, has been practised of late years, and offers some chances
of success.Oesophagostomy and gastrostomy have been performed in some
cases of impassable stricture, and the latter operation is gaining in
favor.For surgical details, however, we must refer to works on
surgery.Carcinoma of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Carcinomatous degeneration of the oesophagus, whatever the
variety.SYNONYM.--Cancer of the oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Carcinoma is the most frequent disease of the oesophagus
that comes under professional observation.The most frequent variety is
the squamous-celled (53 out of 57, Butlin).Spheroidal-celled and
glandular-celled varieties are much less frequent.In some instances
the morbid product is a combination of the two.Colloid degeneration is
occasionally met with.Its cause is
undetermined, but, as it is most frequent at the constricted portions
of the tube, pressure is supposed to be the exciting cause.It does not
always give rise to secondary infection.Sometimes it is an extension
from the tongue, epiglottis, or larynx, or from the stomach.It is most
frequent in males, and more so in the intemperate than in the
abstinent.The immediate exciting cause is often attributed to local injury from
retention of foreign bodies or the deglutition of hot, acrid, or
indigestible substances.{427} There appears to be some disposition to carcinoma of the
oesophagus in tuberculous subjects (Hamburger), while the children of
tuberculous parents may have carcinoma of the oesophagus, and their
offspring, again, tuberculosis.SYMPTOMS.--The earliest local symptom is slight dysphagia, with
impediment to completion of the act of glutition--an evidence of
commencing stricture.Subsequently, inverted peristaltic action is
added, an evidence of dilatation above the stricture, with partial
retention of food.At a later stage vomiting will occur, with
admixtures of pus and sanguinolent fragments of cancerous tissue.Progressive emaciation and impaired physical endurance usually precede
these local symptoms, but actual cachectic depression may come on quite
tardily.At first there is no pain; subsequently there comes on
considerable uneasiness at some portion of the tube.Finally, there may
be severe local burning or lancinating pains, particularly after meals.If the disease be high up, there may be pain between the shoulders,
along the neck, and even in the head, with radiating pains toward
either shoulder and along the arm.If low down, there may be intense
cardialgia and even cardiac spasm.If the trachea or larynx be
compressed or displaced, dyspnoea will be produced.If the recurrent
laryngeal nerve be compressed, there will be dysphonia or aphonia.Perforation of the larynx will be indicated by cough, expectoration,
hoarseness, or loss of voice; of the trachea, by paroxysmal cough,
dyspnoea, or suffocative spasm; of the lungs, by acute pneumonitis,
especially if food shall have escaped, and expectoration of blood, pus,
and matters swallowed, as may be; of the pleura, by pneumothorax; of
the mediastinum, by emphysema; of the pericardium, by pericarditis; of
the large vessels, by hemorrhage.Perforation of the aorta or pulmonary
artery is often followed by sudden death from hemorrhage, and of the
lungs by rapid death from pneumonitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Primitive carcinoma is usually
circumscribed.It is most frequent at the cardiac extremity, but often
occurs where the oesophagus is crossed by the left bronchus, and
sometimes occupies the entire length of the tube.The greater
proclivity of the lower third of the oesophagus has been attributed to
mechanical pressure where it passes through the diaphragm; that of the
middle third, to pressure of its anterior wall against the left
bronchus by the bolus.It begins, either nodulated or diffuse, in the
submucous connective tissue, implicates the mucous membrane, encroaches
upon the calibre of the tube, undergoes softening and ulceration, and
becomes covered with exuberant granulations.When the entire
circumference of the oesophagus is involved stricture results,
sometimes amounting eventually to complete obstruction.Ulceration
taking place, the calibre again becomes permeable.The oesophagus
becomes dilated above the constriction and collapsed below it.As the disease progresses the adjoining tissues become involved.Adhesions may take place with trachea, bronchi, bronchial glands,
lungs, diaphragm, or even the spinal column (Newman[22]).Perforation
may take place into the trachea, usually just above the bifurcation, or
into the lungs, pleura, mediastinum, pericardium, aorta, or pulmonary
artery.Abscesses are formed, the contents of which undergo
putrefaction.There {428} may be involvement of the pneumogastric
nerve, with reflex influence on the spinal nerves and the sympathetic
(Gurmay[23]).Journ._, Aug., 1879, p.de l'Aisne_, 1869; _Gaz.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest on due appreciation of the symptoms
enumerated and the ultimate evidence of the cancerous cachexia.Auscultation will often reveal the location of the disease.This may be
further confirmed by palpation with the bougie, but the manipulation
should be made without using any appreciable force.Laryngoscopic
inspection and digital exploration are sufficient when the entrance
into the oesophagus is involved.Differential diagnosis is difficult at an early stage, and often to be
based solely on negative phenomena.At a later stage it is easy,
especially when cancerous fragments are expelled.In some instances a
tumor can be felt externally.Such a tumor, however, has been known to
have been the head of the pancreas (Reid[24]).Journ._, Oct., 1877, p.Cancer of the oesophagus is liable to be confounded with chronic
oesophagitis, cicatricial stenosis, diverticulum, extraneous
compression, abscess, and non-malignant morbid growths.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is unfavorable, the disease incurable.Death
may be expected in from one to two years, though sometimes delayed for
longer periods.Inanition or marasmus is the usual cause of death in
uncomplicated cases.Sometimes it takes place by haematemesis,
sometimes following involvement of the stomach, and sometimes wholly
unassociated with any direct disease of the walls of the stomach.Death
takes place not infrequently from perforation into adjoining organs,
and sometimes from secondary inflammation of other vital organs, as the
brain and the lungs.TREATMENT.--There is little to be done in the way of treatment apart
from the constitutional measures indicated in carcinoma generally and
in chronic diseases of the oesophagus.The cautious use of the
stomach-tube to convey nourishment into the stomach is allowable during
the earlier stages of the disease only.It is dangerous after
ulceration has taken place, from the risk of perforating the walls of
the oesophagus, and thus hurrying on the fatal issue by injury to the
intrathoracic tissues.When deglutition becomes impracticable or the passage of the oesophagus
absolutely impermeable to nutriment, food and alcoholic stimuli should
be administered by enema.Indeed, it is good practice to begin to give
nourishment occasionally by the bowel before it becomes absolutely
necessary, so as to accustom the part and the patient to the
manipulation.Narcotics to relieve pain are best administered
hypodermatically, so as to avoid unnecessary irritation of the rectum.The passage of dilators, as in stricture of cicatricial origin, is very
hazardous.They produce irritation, which hastens the softening of the
tissues, and are open to the risk of penetrating the softened tissues
and passing through the walls of the oesophagus into the pleura, lung,
or mediastinum.Fatal accidents of this nature are on record.Gastrostomy is sometimes performed to prolong life.{429} Paralysis of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Loss of motive-force in the muscular tissue of the
oesophagus, whether intrinsic or reflex in origin.SYNONYMS.--Gulae imbecillitas, Paralytic dysphagia, Atonic dysphagia.ETIOLOGY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be caused by impairment of
function in one or more of the nervous tracts distributed to the
muscles concerned in dilating the upper orifice of the gullet or in
those concerned in the peristaltic movements which propel the bolus to
the stomach.These impairments of function may be nutritive in origin,
as in softening and atrophy of the nerve-trunk, or, as is more
frequent, they may be pressure-phenomena from extravasations of blood,
purulent accumulations, exostoses, tumors, and the like.The paralysis may be due to disease or wounds of the nerves themselves
or of their motor roots, or of the cerebro-spinal axis, implicating
their origin, or to pressure and atrophy of a trunk-nerve in some
portion of its tract.It is likewise due to neurasthenia from
hemorrhage or from protracted disease (enteric fever, yellow fever,
cholera), or to systemic poisoning in diphtheria, syphilis, and
plumbism.It may be due to muscular atrophy or intermuscular
proliferations of connective tissue, to dilatation of the oesophagus,
and to disease in the tube.It may be due to mechanical restraint from
external adhesions of the oesophagus to intrathoracic tumors
(Finny[25]).It may follow
the sudden reaction of cold upon the overheated body.It is one of the
manifestations of hysteria and of the hysteria of pregnancy.SYMPTOMS.--Partial paralysis may give rise to no symptoms at all.The
earliest manifestations are those of impediment to the prompt passage
of the bolus to the stomach, repeated acts of deglutition or additional
swallows of food or drink being necessary.Large masses are swallowed
and propelled onward more readily than small ones, and solids more
readily than fluids.There is often a characteristic gurgling attending
the passage of fluids along the tube.Swallowing is best performed in
the erect posture.These symptoms increase in severity as the paralysis
increases.In some cases there is
no regurgitation of food; in others, this is more or less frequent.When the paralysis is complete, deglutition becomes impossible, and the
food attempted to be swallowed is expelled from the mouth and nose in a
paroxysm of cough.Sometimes the food enters the larynx and produces
paroxysms of suffocation or threatens asphyxia.There is more or less flow of saliva from the mouth in consequence of
the inability to swallow it; and in some cases the losses of material
from the blood are so great as to reduce the patient very rapidly.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be
partial or complete.It may be associated with paralysis of the
pharynx, palate, tongue, epiglottis, or larynx; with so-called bulbar
paralysis; with general paralysis; with cerebro-spinal disseminated
sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests mainly on the symptoms of dysphagia,
especially when associated with paralyses elsewhere.It is
differentiated {430} from paralysis of the pharynx by the ability to
swallow the bolus and the apparent arrest of the bolus at some portion
of the tube.Auscultation of the oesophagus will determine the locality
of the arrest.It likewise affords presumptive evidence of an
alteration in the usual form of the bolus, which, being subjected to
compression at its upper portion only, assumes the form of an inverted
cone.The remaining auscultatory indications are similar to those of
dilatation.There is no impediment to the passage of the stomach-tube or
oesophageal sound, or to its free manipulation when within the
oesophagus.When the symptoms quickly reach a maximum, they indicate a paralysis
due to apoplexy, and so they do when the symptoms are sudden, hysteria
being eliminated.Paralysis due to gumma or other cerebral tumor is
much slower in its course.PROGNOSIS.--In idiopathic paralysis, the local or special affection to
which it is due being curable, the prognosis is favorable, especially
if the paralysis be confined to the oesophagus.Recovery, however, is
often slow, even in curable cases.In hysterical paralysis the
prognosis is good.In deuteropathic paralysis the prognosis is much
less favorable, and will depend upon the nature of the causal
disease--apoplexy, insanity, cerebral tumor, syphilis, etc.TREATMENT.--The treatment varies with the nature of the cause as far as
combating the origin of the disease is concerned.With regard to the
intrinsic paralysis of the oesophagus itself, strychnine and its
congeners are indicated, and may be administered hypodermatically if
the difficulty in swallowing be very great.If the paralysis be
partial, it is better to give nux vomica or Ignatia amara by the mouth,
in hopes of getting some beneficial astringent influence on the walls
of the oesophagus.In all instances the feeding of the patient is an important element in
treatment.Masses of food arrested in the tube should be forced onward
with the sound.In some cases nourishment must be habitually introduced
through the stomach-tube and nutritive enemata be resorted to.Electricity, though sometimes successful, is a risky agent to employ,
because, as announced by Duchenne, the use of an oesophageal electrode
is attended with some risk of unduly exciting the pneumogastric nerve
and thereby inducing syncope.Dilatation of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--An abnormal distension of a portion of the oesophagus or
of the entire tube, whether general, annular, or pouched.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagocele, Hernia of the oesophagus, Diverticulum of the
oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is occasionally met as a
congenital affection (Hanney,[26] Grisolle,[27] and others).Usually, however, dilatation of
the oesophagus is of mechanical origin, due to distension by food or
water above a stricture or an impacted foreign body.Presumptive
paralysis of the muscular coat in chronic oesophagitis is alleged as a
source of similar distension.int._, Paris, 1883, ii.{431} General dilatation is presumed to be the mechanical result of
constriction of the cardiac extremity, leading to distension of the
oesophagus by the accumulation of large quantities of liquids.Sometimes it is due to paralysis of the muscular coat, permitting its
distension by food.Annular dilatation is sometimes due to distension just above the seat
of a stricture.Sometimes it is due to impaction of a foreign body;
sometimes there is no mechanical impediment; occasionally it is
observed as a congenital anomaly.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually due to retention of food
immediately above an impacted foreign body or some obstruction of
another character.Some of the muscular fibres of the oesophageal wall
become separated and spread asunder, allowing the mucous membrane to be
gradually forced through them by repeated efforts of deglutition upon
retained masses of food or drink, until finally a pouch is formed,
hernia-like, outside of the tube.Another mode of production is said
(Rokitansky[28]) to consist in the subsidence of tumefied glands
outside the oesophagus, after adhesions had been contracted with the
oesophagus during the inflammatory process.The shrinking of these
enlarged glands to their normal volume sometimes draws the tube outward
into a funnel-shaped sac constricted at its margin by the muscular
coat, which has receded from the pouch or has been stripped loose.The
same form of dilatation is likewise an occasional result of rupture of
the muscular coat sustained in blows or falls.It occasionally exists,
too, as a congenital defect, and this has been attributed (Bardeleben
and Billroth[29]) to partial closing of one of the branchial fissures
externally, while the internal opening has remained patent.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms, at first, are usually those of
obstruction to the passage of food, but before this obstruction occurs
dilatation may have existed without symptoms.In some cases of
diverticulum high up, there is a tumor, usually on the left side of the
neck.Rokitansky has reported one the size of the fist situated on the
right side of the neck, and Hankel[30] and others a tumor upon each
side.The tumor varies in bulk from time to time according as it may be
empty or may be distended with food, drink, or gas.[Footnote 30: _Rust's Mag._, 1833; _Dict.cit._]

Food caught in the pouch can often be forced out into the pharynx by
external pressure over the tumor in the neck.The retention of food
above a constriction or in a sac is usually accompanied by some
distress after indulgence in too much food.This uneasiness becomes
relieved upon regurgitation or vomiting.Deglutition is impeded to a
less extent when the disease does not implicate the upper portion of
the gut.Complete dilatation is sometimes indicated by long addiction to habits
of rumination.In some instances this rumination is an agreeable
sensuous process.In pouched dilatation it is very often disagreeable,
the regurgitated matters being acrid, owing to acid fermentation of the
contents of the sac.While the dilatation remains moderate there may be little dysphagia or
none at all, the muscles continuing sufficiently vigorous to propel the
food; but after the muscles become paralyzed by distension the
dysphagia gradually increases and may culminate in complete aphagia.One {432} of the special indications of diverticulum is that the
regurgitation does not take place until several hours after a meal.As
the sac enlarges there may be less and less complaint of dysphagia,
because it becomes able to contain larger quantities of food.At the
same time it may so compress the main tube as to occlude its calibre
and prevent access of food to the stomach.The symptoms of annular dilatation are similar to those of stricture
with retention of food above it, the regurgitation usually following
deglutition more quickly.In some cases of dilatation, circumscribed and general, food is
sometimes retained for an entire day or more before it is ejected.The
decomposition of the retained food usually produces a more or less
continuous foul odor from the mouth.The course of the affection is progressively from bad to worse, and
entails ultimate emaciation.Some patients succumb early, and some live
to advanced age.Perforation of the oesophagus ensues in some
instances, and death results in consequence of the injuries sustained
by perioesophageal structures by the escape of the contents of the
oesophagus.Perforation is indicated by sudden collapse and by
emphysema from swallowed air.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is either
general or partial, according as it takes place in the whole or greater
portion of the oesophagus or in a circumscribed portion.Partial
dilatation may involve the entire circumference of the canal (annular
dilatation), or it may implicate but a portion of the wall, which
becomes pouched into a sac externally (diverticulum or saccular
dilatation).General dilatation, though sometimes congenital, is, as mentioned under
Etiology, more frequently the mechanical result of distension of the
oesophagus by food or drink prevented from ready entrance into the
stomach by a constriction at the cardiac orifice.This form of
dilatation is sometimes discovered as a post-mortem curiosity.The
muscles have usually undergone great hypertrophy, and the mucous
membrane some thickening and congestion, with erosions and sometimes
ulcerations, indicative of chronic oesophagitis.In some instances all
the coats of the oesophagus have undergone hypertrophy.The dilatation
may vary from slight enlargement to the thickness of an ordinary man's
arm or larger (Rokitansky[31]); in rare cases, even a capacity nearly
equal to that of the stomach (Luschka[32] and others).Anat._]

[Footnote 32: _Arch.fur Anat., etc._, March, 1868, p.Fusiform Dilatation of Oesophagus (Luschka).A,
Larynx; B, Thyroid gland; C, Trachea; D, Oesophagus; E, Stomach.]The oesophagus is usually fusiform or spindle-shaped, being constricted
at those portions at which it is normally slightly constricted.Sometimes the dilatation takes place between the lobes of the lungs
(Raymond[33]).Annular dilatation is usually due to circumferential distension just
above a stricture.When not due to stricture its seat is usually just
above the diaphragm, where the oesophagus is normally liable to
constriction.The upper portion of the dilatation is larger than the
lower portion, and the muscular walls are usually hypertrophied.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually formed chiefly of mucous
membrane and submucous tissue pushed through gaps in the fibres of the
{433} muscular coat, produced by distension.It sometimes involves the
entire coat in cases in which the oesophageal wall has become adherent
to enlarged lymphatic glands, which subsequently undergo subsidence in
volume and drag the adherent portion of the wall after them
(Rokitansky).The muscular walls are then usually hypertrophied, the
mucous membrane sometimes hypertrophied, sometimes atrophied.The
diverticulum is usually located in the upper portion of the oesophagus,
just below the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx.It may thus
be, in part, a pharyngocele also.It may be located behind the point of
bifurcation of the trachea or where the oesophagus is crossed by the
left bronchus.Its direction may be to the left side in the upper
portion of the oesophagus, to the right side, or upon both sides; but
when situated lower down it is usually directed backward, between the
posterior wall of the tube and the spinal column.Hence its distension
with food completely blocks up the calibre of the oesophagus.The
orifice by which the oesophageal wall remains in communication with the
pouch is round or elliptic in shape and variable in size, sometimes
being about an inch in its long diameter, sometimes much smaller.The
size of the diverticulum varies; a common size is that of a duck egg,
but the size of a fist has been attained.Sometimes the diverticulum
drags the oesophagus out of position and forms a sort of blind pouch in
the direct line of its axis, so that it becomes filled with food which
fails to reach the stomach.The dilatations become enlarged by retention of food, and are liable to
undergo inflammation, ulceration, and perforation.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will depend upon the symptoms of dysphagia,
regurgitation, and so on, and upon the evidence furnished by
auscultatory indications, palpation with the oesophageal sound, and, in
some instances, the existence of a tumor in the neck, enlarging after
meals, and {434} from which food or mucus can be forced up into the
pharynx by pressure externally.Stethoscopic auscultation of the oesophagus during the deglutition of
water indicates an alteration in the usual form of the gulp, which
seems to trickle rapidly in a larger or smaller stream according to the
degree of dilatation.If the dilatation be annular and located high up,
auscultation is said to give the impression of a general sprinkling of
fluid deflected from its course.The peculiar gurgle is often audible
without the aid of stethoscopy.Palpation with the oesophageal bougie
is competent to reveal the existence of a large sac by the facility
with which the terminal extremity of the sound can be moved in the
cavity.In the case of a diverticulum, however, the sound may glide
past the mouth of the pouch without entering it, although arrested at
the bottom of the sac in most instances.In annular dilatation any constriction below it is usually perceptible
to the touch through the sound; but, on the other hand, the ready
passage of the bougie into the stomach, while excluding stricture, does
not positively disprove the existence of a circumscribed dilatation.If
high up, the dilatation may be detected externally by its enlargement
when filled with food after a meal, and the subsidence of tumefaction
when the sac is emptied by pressure from without, or by regurgitation.If the dilatation occupy a position which exercises compression of the
trachea, dyspnoea will ensue when it is distended.The intermittence of
the tumefaction serves to differentiate the swelling from abscess or
morbid growth.From aneurism of the aorta, which it may simulate
(Davy[34]), it is to be discriminated by absence of the usual
stethoscopic and circulatory manifestations.The diagnosis of
congenital dilatation is based upon a history of difficulty in
deglutition dating from the earliest period of recollection.Press and
Circular_, May, 1874.]PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is not favorable in any given case unless the
cause can be removed, and not even then unless food can be prevented
from accumulating in the distended portion of the tube.Nevertheless,
cases sometimes go on into advanced age.On the other hand, they may
terminate fatally within a year (Lindau[35]).The danger of perforation
adds additional gravity to the prognosis, for life may be suddenly lost
by this accident.A case of
death by suffocation has been recorded, attributed to the pressure of
the distended oesophagus upon the intrathoracic vessels (Hannay[36]).[Footnote 35: _Casper's Wochenschrift_, 1840, No.de
Med._, 1841, p.de Med et de Chir._, xxiv.Journ._, July 1, 1833.]TREATMENT.--If the dilatation be due to stricture or to an impacted
foreign body, the treatment should be directed to overcoming the one
and removing the other.General dilatation from chronic oesophagitis requires treatment for
that disease.Much depends upon preventing the accumulation of food in a sac or
diverticle; the best means of accomplishing which is the systematic
administration of all nutriment by means of the stomach-tube.When this
is not advisable, care must be exercised in the selection of such food
as is least likely to irritate the parts if detained in the pouch.{435} As far as general treatment is concerned, stimulants are usually
indicated, as the patients become much reduced.If paralysis of the
muscular coat of the oesophagus is believed to exist, the
administration of preparations of phosphorus and of strychnine are
indicated on general principles of therapeutics.Stimulation of
muscular contractility by the oesophageal electrode has been
recommended, but the prospects of success hardly justify the risks of
serious injury in the domain of the pneumogastric nerve.It has not yet been determined whether surgical procedures are
competent to relieve dilatation.In cases of pouched dilatation high up
it would not be difficult, as suggested by Michel,[37] to expose the
sac and excise it in such a manner that the sutures uniting the walls
of the oesophagus shall occupy the site of the mouth of the
diverticulum, and, thus obliterating it by cicatrization, restore the
normal path of the food from the pharynx to the oesophagus.Gastrostomy, too, should hold out some hope of rescue, no matter what
portion of the oesophagus be dilated.{436}

FUNCTIONAL AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE STOMACH.BY SAMUEL G. ARMOR, M.D., LL.D.Functional Dyspepsia (Atonic Dyspepsia, Indigestion).To difficulty in the physiological process of digestion the familiar
name of dyspepsia has been given, while to a merely disturbed condition
of the function the term indigestion is more frequently applied.This
distinction, difficult at all times to make, may appear more arbitrary
than real; and inasmuch as it involves no important practical point,
the author of the present article will use the terms interchangeably as
indicating functional disturbance of the stomach--_i.e._ disturbance of
the digestive process not associated with changes of an inflammatory
character, so far as we know.Since it is one of the most common of all complaints from its
association with various other morbid conditions, the term is not
unfrequently vaguely employed.It is difficult, of course, to define a
disease whose etiology is so directly related to so many distinct
morbid conditions.Indeed, there are few diseases, general or local,
which are not at some time in their history associated with more or
less derangement of the digestive process.For purposes of limitation,
therefore, it will be understood that we now refer to chronic
functional forms of indigestion which depend largely, at least, on a
purely nervous element, and for this reason are not infrequently
described as sympathetic dyspepsia.Doubt has been expressed as to
whether such forms of disease ever exist, but that we encounter purely
functional forms of dyspepsia, corresponding to the dyspepsia apyretica
of Broussais, would appear to be a well-recognized clinical fact.What the precise relation is between digestive disturbances and the
nervous system we may not fully understand, no more than we understand
how a healthy condition of nervous endowment is essential to all vital
processes.Even lesions of nutrition are now known to depend upon
primary disturbance of nervous influence.This is seen in certain skin
diseases, such as herpes zoster, which closely follows the destruction
of certain nerves.And it is well known that injury of nerve-trunks is
not unfrequently followed by impaired nutrition and failure in
reparative power in the parts to which such nerves are distributed.Indeed, so marked is the influence of the nervous system over the
nutritive operations that the question has been considered as to
whether there are {437} trophic nerves distributed to tissue-elements
themselves whose special function is to keep these elements in a
healthy state of nutrition.The proof, at least, that the digestive
process is, in some unexplained way, under the immediate influence of
the nervous system, either cerebro-spinal or trophic, is both varied
and abundant.The digestive secretions are known to be the products of
living cells which are abundantly supplied with nerve-fibres, and we
can readily believe that the potential energy of this cell-force is
probably vital and trophic.At any rate, it is unknown in the domain of
ordinary chemistry.The digestive ferments, as clearly pointed out by
Roberts, are the direct products of living cells.Their mode of action,
he claims, bears no resemblance to that of ordinary chemical affinity.Nor do they derive their
vital endowments from material substances."They give nothing material
to, and take nothing from, the substances acted on.The albuminoid
matter which constitutes their mass is evidently no more than the
material substance of a special kind of energy--just as the steel of a
magnet is the material substratum of the magnetic energy, but is not
itself that energy" (Roberts).That this living cell-force is partly,
at least, derived from the nervous system is clear from the well-known
effects of mental emotion, such as acute grief, despair, etc., in
putting an immediate stop to the digestive process.Experiments on the
lower animals have also shown the direct influence of the nervous
system over gastric secretion.Wilson Philip showed by various
experiments on rabbits and other animals that if the eighth pair of
nerves be divided in the neck, any food which the creatures may
afterward eat remains in the stomach undigested, and after death, when
the nerve has been divided, the coats of the stomach are not found
digested, however long the animal may have been dead.Bernard also
excited a copious secretion by galvanization of the pneumogastric, and
by section of the same nerve stopped the process of digestion and
produced "pallor and flaccidity of the stomach."Recently doubt has
been thrown on these statements of Bernard and Frerichs.Goltz
concludes, from observations made on frogs, that nerve-ganglia,
connected by numerous intercommunicating bundles of nerve-fibres, exist
in the walls of the stomach, the irritation of which gives rise to
local contractions and peristaltic movements of the stomach, and that
these ganglia influence the gastric secretion.However this may be, it
still remains true that these gastric ganglia are in connection,
through the vagi, with the medulla oblongata, and are thus influenced
by the cerebro-spinal nerve-centres.And clinical observation confirms
what theoretical considerations would suggest.Thus, strong mental
impressions are known to produce sudden arrest of secretion, and that
which arrests secretion may, if continued, lead to perversion of the
same.Impressions made upon the nerves of special sense are also known to
affect the salivary and gastric secretions.The flow of saliva is
stimulated by the sight, the smell, the taste, and even thought, of
food.Bidder and Schmidt made interesting experiments on dogs bearing
upon this point.They ascertained by placing meat before dogs that had
been kept fasting that gastric juice was copiously effused into the
stomach.Other secretions are known to be similarly affected.Carpenter
by a series of well-observed cases has shown the direct influence of
mental conditions on the {438} mammary secretion.The nervous
association of diabetes and chronic Bright's disease is interesting in
this connection, and the direct nervous connection betwixt the brain
and the liver has been shown by numerous experiments.It is maintained
by modern physiologists that "the liver--indeed each of the
viscera--has its representative area in the brain, just as much as the
arm or leg is represented in a distant localized area" (Hughlings
Jackson).And in harmony with this view Carpenter long since pointed
out the fact that if the volitional direction of the consciousness to a
part be automatically kept up for a length of time, both the functional
action and the nutrition of the part may suffer.It has been described
by him as expectant attention, and it has, as we shall see, important
practical bearings on the management of gastric affections.Sympathetic
disturbance of the stomach is also connected with direct disease of the
brain.The almost immediate
effects of a blow are nausea and vomiting, and the same thing is
observed in local inflammation of the meninges of the brain.Many forms of functional dyspepsia due to nervous disturbance of a
reflex character will be pointed out when discussing the etiology of
the disease.ETIOLOGY.--Among the agencies affecting the digestive process in atonic
forms of dyspepsia may be mentioned--

First, predisposing causes;

Second, exciting causes.In general terms it may be said that all conditions of depressed
vitality predispose to the varied forms of atonic dyspepsia.These
conditions range through an endless combination of causes, both
predisposing and exciting.There is not a disturbed condition of life,
extrinsic or intrinsic, that may not contribute to this end.In some
cases it may be the effects of hot and enervating climates; in others
the alterations in the elementary constituents of the blood may be
apparent; while in still others the cause may be exhausting discharges,
hemorrhages, profuse suppuration, venereal excesses, sedentary
occupations, and long-continued mental and moral emotions.Heredity may also predispose to functional dyspepsia.Certain faulty
states of the nervous system are specially liable to be transmitted
from parent to offspring--not always in the exact form in which they
appeared in the parent, but in forms determined by the individual life
of the offspring.For obvious reasons, growing out of our modern
American civilization, the inheritance of a faulty nervous organization
is apt to spend itself upon the digestive apparatus.The inordinate
mental activity, the active competitions of life, the struggle for
existence, the haste to get rich, the disappointments of failure,--all
contribute to this end.The general tendency of American life is also
in the direction of a highly-developed and morbidly sensitive nervous
system, and functional dyspepsia is a natural sequence of this.The
symptoms of dyspepsia thus caused usually manifest themselves at an
early period of life.The stomach becomes weak as age
advances, in common with all the functions of the body, and consequent
upon this weakness there is diminished excitability of the gastric
nerves, with diminished muscular action of the walls of the stomach and
deficient secretion of the gastric juice.Chronic structural changes
are {439} also apt to occur in advanced life.The gastric glands become
atrophied and the arteries become atheromatous, so that with symptoms
of indigestion there are often associated loss of consciousness at
times, vertigo, irregular action of the heart, etc.These general facts
have an important bearing upon the hygienic management of dyspepsia in
the aged.They require, as a rule, less food than the young and
vigorous.In times when famine was more frequent than now it was found
that the older a human being was, the better deficiency of food was
borne.Hippocrates tells us, in his _Aphorisms_, that old men suffer
least from abstinence.Their food should be such, both in quantity and
quality, as the enfeebled stomach can digest.There is less demand for
the materials of growth, and consequently for animal food.Moderate
quantities of alcohol, judiciously used, are also specially adapted to
the indigestion of the aged.It has the double effect of stimulating
the digestive process and at the same time checking the activity of
destructive assimilation, which in old age exhausts the vital force.And in order to more effectively arrest destructive metamorphosis great
caution should be taken against excessive muscular fatigue, as well as
against sudden extremes of temperature.Loss of appetite from deficient
formation of gastric juice is a common symptom in old age.This is not
often successfully treated by drugs, and yet medicines are not without
value.The sesquicarbonate of ammonium acts as a stimulant to the
mucous membrane and to the vaso-motor nerve, and in this way becomes a
valuable addition to the simple vegetable bitters.Dilute hydrochloric
acid with the vegetable bitters may also be tried.Condiments with the
food directly stimulate the action of the enfeebled stomach.The old
remedy of mustard-seed is not unfrequently useful, and pepper, cayenne,
horseradish, and curries act in a similar manner in torpid digestion.And in cases of great exhaustion associated with anaemia benefit may be
derived from small doses of iron added to tincture of columbo or
gentian.Nor should it be forgotten that in the opposite extreme of life the
digestive capacity is extremely limited.The infant's digestion is
readily disturbed by unsuitable alimentation.For obvious reasons it
does not easily digest starchy substances.The diastasic ferment does
not exist in the saliva of young sucking animals, at least to any
extent.No food is so suitable for early infantile life as the mother's
milk, provided the mother herself is healthy.It contains in an easily
digestible form all the constituents necessary to the rapidly-growing
young animal.Van Helmont's substitute of bread boiled in beer and
honey for milk, or Baron Liebig's food for infants, cannot take the
place of nature's type of food, which we find in milk.If a substitute
has to be selected, there is nothing so good as cow's milk diluted with
an equal quantity of soft water, or, what in many cases is better,
barley-water, to which may be added a teaspoonful of powdered sugar of
milk and a pinch of table-salt and phosphate of lime.Lime-water may be
added with advantage.Dilution of alimentary substances is an important
condition of absorption in the infant stomach.Anaemia is a common predisposing cause of indigestion.Indeed, as a
widely-prevailing pathological condition few causes stand out so
prominent.It affects at once the great nutritive processes, and these
in turn disturb the functional activity of all the organs of the body.Not only are the gastric and intestinal glands diminished in their
{440} functional activity by impoverished or altered blood, but the
movements of the stomach are retarded by weakened muscular action.It
is impossible to separate altered blood from perverted tissue-structure
and altered secretion.Indigestion produced by anaemia is difficult of
treatment, on account of the complexity of the pathological conditions
usually present, the anaemia itself being generally a secondary
condition.Careful inquiry should be made, therefore, into the probable
cause of the anaemia, and this should, if possible, be removed as an
important part of the treatment of the dyspepsia.Nothing will more
promptly restore the digestive capacity in such cases than good,
healthy, well-oxidized blood.Indeed, healthy blood is a condition
precedent to the normal functional activity of the stomach.To these general predisposing causes may be added indigestion occurring
in febrile states of the system.In all
general febrile conditions the secretions are markedly disturbed; the
tongue is dry and furred; the urine is scanty; the excretions lessened;
the bowels constipated; and the appetite gone.The nervous system also
participates in the general disturbance.In this condition the gastric
juice is changed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and digestion,
as a consequence, becomes weak and imperfect--a fact that should be
taken into account in regulating the diet of febrile patients.From
mere theoretical considerations there can be no doubt that fever
patients are often overfed.To counteract the relatively increased
tissue-metamorphosis known to exist, and the consequent excessive
waste, forced nutrition is frequently resorted to.Then the traditional
saying of the justly-celebrated Graves, that he fed fevers, has also
rendered popular the practice.Within certain bounds alimentation is
undoubtedly an important part of the treatment of all the essential
forms of fever.But if more food is crowded upon the stomach than can
be digested and assimilated, it merely imposes a burden instead of
supplying a want.The excess of food beyond the digestive capacity
decomposes, giving rise to fetid gases, and often to troublesome
intestinal complications.The true mode of restoring strength in such
cases is to administer only such quantities of food as the patient is
capable of digesting and assimilating.To this end resort has been had
to food in a partially predigested state, such as peptonized milk, milk
gruel, soups, jellies, and beef-tea; and clinical experience has thus
far shown encouraging results from such nutrition in the management of
general fevers.In these febrile conditions, and in all cases of
general debility, the weak digestion does not necessarily involve
positive disease of the stomach, for by regulating the diet according
to the digestive capacity healthy digestion may be obtained for an
indefinite time.Exhaustion of the nerves of organic life strongly predisposes to the
atonic forms of dyspepsia.We have already seen how markedly the
digestive process is influenced by certain mental states, and it is a
well-recognized fact that the sympathetic system of nerves is
intimately associated with all the vegetative functions of the body.Without a certain amount of nervous energy derived from this portion of
the nervous system, there is failure of the two most important
conditions of digestion--viz.muscular movements of the stomach and
healthy secretion of gastric juice.This form of indigestion is
peculiar to {441} the ill-fed and badly-nourished.It follows in the
wake of privation and want, and is often seen in the peculiarly
careworn and sallow classes who throng our public dispensaries.In this
dyspepsia of exhaustion the solvent power of the stomach is so
diminished that if food is forced upon the patient it is apt to be
followed by flatulence, headache, uneasy or painful sensations in the
stomach, and sometimes by nausea and diarrhoea.It is best treated by
improving in every possible way the general system of nutrition, and by
adapting the food, both in quantity and quality, to the enfeebled
condition of the digestive powers.Hygienic measures are also of great
importance in the management of this form of dyspepsia, and especially
such as restore the lost energy of the nervous system.If it occur in
badly-nourished persons who take little outdoor exercise, the food
should be adapted to the feeble digestive power.It should consist for
a time largely of milk and eggs, oatmeal, peptonized milk gruels, stale
bread; to which should be added digestible nitrogenous meat diet in
proportion to increased muscular exercise.Systematic outdoor exercise
should be insisted upon as a sine qua non.Much benefit may be derived
from the employment of electric currents, and hydrotherapy has also
given excellent results.If the indigestion occur in the badly-fed
outdoor day-laborer, his food should be more generous and mixed.It
should consist largely, however, of digestible nitrogenous food, and
meat, par excellence, should be increased in proportion to the exercise
taken.Medicinally, such cases should be treated on general principles.Benefit may be derived from the mineral acids added to simple bitters,
or in cases of extreme nervous prostration small doses of nux vomica
are a valuable addition to dilute hydrochloric acid.The not unfrequent
resort to phosphorus in such cases is of more than doubtful utility.Some interesting contributions have been recently made to this subject
of gastric neuroses by Buchard, See, and Mathieu.Buchard claims that
atonic dilatation of the stomach is a very frequent result of an
adynamic state of the general system.He compares it to certain forms
of cardiac dilatation--both expressions of myasthenia.It may result
from profound anaemia or from psychical causes.Mathieu regards mental
depression as only second in frequency.Much stress is laid upon
poisons generated by fermenting food in the stomach in such cases.It
may cause a true toxaemia, just as renal diseases give rise to uraemia.Of course treatment in such cases must be addressed principally to the
general constitution.But of all predisposing causes of dyspepsia, deficient gastric
secretion, with resulting fermentation of food, is perhaps the most
prevalent.It is true this deficient secretion may be, and often is, a
secondary condition; many causes contribute to its production; but
still, the practical fact remains that the immediate cause of the
indigestion is disproportion between the quantity of gastric juice
secreted and the amount of food taken into the stomach.In all such
cases we have what is popularly known as torpidity of digestion, and
the condition described is that of atony of the stomach.The two main
constituents of gastric juice--namely, acid and pepsin--may be
deficient in quantity or disturbed in their relative proportions.A
certain amount of acid is absolutely essential to the digestive
process, while a small amount of pepsin may be sufficient to digest a
large amount of albuminoid food.{442} Pure unmixed gastric juice was
first analyzed by Bidder and Schmidt.The mean analyses of ten
specimens free from saliva, procured from dogs, gave the following
results:

  _Gastric Juice of a Dog_.Water                        973.06
  Solids                        26.94
    Containing--Peptone and pepsin   17.19
    Free hydrochloric acid            3.05
    Alkaline chlorides                4.26
    Ammonium chloride                 0.47
    Chlorine                          5.06
               | Lime                 1.73
    Phosphates | Magnesia             0.23
               | Iron                 0.08

They proved by the most careful analyses that fresh gastric juice
contains only one mineral acid--namely, hydrochloric; since which time
Richet has been able to prove that "this acid does not exist in a free
state, but in loose combination with an organic substance known as
lucin," the chloride of lucin.And just here the curious and puzzling
question arises as to the secretion of a mineral acid from alkaline
blood.Ewald, the distinguished lecturer in the Royal University of
Berlin, tells us that "a brilliant experiment of Maly's has thrown
unexpected light upon this.There are fluids of alkaline reaction which
may contain two acid and alkaline mutually inoffensive salts, but still
have an alkaline reaction, because the acid reaction is to a certain
extent eclipsed; for instance, a solution of neutral phosphate of soda
(Na_{2}HPO_{4}) and acid phosphate of soda (NaH_{2}PO_{4}) is alkaline.Such a solution placed in a dialyzer after a short time gives up its
acid salt to the surrounding distilled water, and one has in the
dialyzer an alkaline fluid outside an acid fluid."He thus proved that
the acid phosphate of sodium is present in the blood in spite of its
alkaline reaction.Lack of the normal amount of the gastric secretion must be met by
restoring the physiological conditions upon which the secretion
depends.In the mean time, hydrochloric and lactic acids may be tried
for the purpose of strengthening the solvent powers of the gastric
secretion.EXCITING CAUSES.--The immediate causes of dyspepsia are such as act
more directly on the stomach.They embrace all causes which produce
conditions of gastric catarrh, such as excess in eating and drinking,
imperfect mastication and insalivation, the use of indigestible or
unwholesome food and of alcohol, the imperfect arrangement of meals,
over-drugging, etc.Of exciting causes, errors of diet are amongst the most constantly
operative, and of these errors excess of food is doubtless the most
common.The influence of this as an etiological factor in derangement
of digestion can scarcely be exaggerated.In very many instances more
food is taken into the stomach than is actually required to restore
tissue-waste, and the effects of such excess upon the organism are as
numerous as they are hurtful.Indeed, few elements of disease are more
constantly operative in a great variety of ailments.In the first
place, if food be introduced into the stomach beyond
tissue-requirements, symptoms of indigestion at once manifest
themselves.The natural balance betwixt {443} supply and demand is
disturbed; the general nutrition of the body is interfered with; local
disturbances of nutrition follow; and mal-products of digestion find
their way into the blood.Especially is this the case when the
excessive amount of food contains a disproportionate amount of
nitrogenous matter.All proteid principles require a considerable
amount of chemical alteration before they are fitted for the metabolic
changes of the organism; the processes of assimilative conversion are
more complex than those undergone by fats and amyloids; and it follows
that there is proportional danger of disturbance of these processes
from overwork.Moreover, if nitrogenous food is in excess of
tissue-requirement, it undergoes certain oxidation changes in the blood
without becoming previously woven into tissue, with resulting compounds
which become positive poisons in the economy.The kidneys and skin are
largely concerned in the elimination of these compounds, and the
frequency with which these organs become diseased is largely due, no
doubt, to the excessive use of unassimilated nitrogenous food.Then,
again, if food be introduced in excess of the digestive capacity, the
undigested portion acts directly upon the stomach as a foreign body,
and in undergoing decomposition and putrefying changes frets and
irritates the mucous membrane.It can scarcely be a matter of doubt
that large groups of diseases have for their principal causes excess of
alimentation beyond the actual requirements of the system.All such
patients suffer from symptoms of catarrhal indigestion, such as gastric
uneasiness, headache, vertigo, a general feeling of lassitude,
constipation, and high- urine with abundant urates, together
with varied skin eruptions.Such cases are greatly relieved by reducing
the amount of food taken, especially nitrogenous food, and by a
systematic and somewhat prolonged course of purgative mineral waters.The waters of Carlsbad,
Ems, Seltzer, Friedrichshall, and Marienbad, and many of the alkaline
purgative waters of our own country, not unfrequently prove valuable to
those who can afford to try them, and their value shows how often
deranged primary assimilation is at the foundation of many human
ailments.The absurd height to which so-called restorative medicine has
attained within the last twenty years or more has contributed largely
to the production of inflammatory forms of indigestion, with all the
evil consequences growing out of general deranged nutrition.The use of indigestible and unwholesome food entails somewhat the same
consequences.This may consist in the use of food essentially unhealthy
or indigestible, or made so by imperfect preparation (cooking, etc.).Certain substances taken as food cannot be dissolved by the gastric or
intestinal secretions: the seeds, the skins, and rinds of fruit, the
husks of corn and bran, and gristle and elastic tissue, as well as
hairs in animal food, are thrown off as they are swallowed, and if
taken in excess they mechanically irritate the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane and excite symptoms of acute dyspepsia, and not unfrequently
give rise to pain of a griping character accompanied by diarrhoea.Symptoms of acute dyspepsia also frequently follow the ingestion of
special kinds of food, such as mushrooms, shellfish, or indeed fish of
any kind; and food not adapted to the individual organism is apt to
excite dyspeptic symptoms.Appetite and digestion are also very much
influenced by the life and {444} habits of the individual.The diet,
for instance, of bodily labor should consist largely of digestible
nitrogenous food, and meat, par excellence, should be increased in
proportion as muscular exercise is increased.For all sorts of muscular
laborers a mixed diet is best in which animal food enters as a
prominent ingredient.Thus, it has been found, according to the
researches of Chambers, that in forced military marches meat extract
has greater sustaining properties than any other kind of food.But with
those who do not take much outdoor exercise the error is apt to be, as
already pointed out, in the direction of over-feeding.It cannot be
doubted at the present time that over-eating (gluttony) is one of our
popular vices.Hufeland says: "In general we find that men who live
sparingly attain to the greatest age."While preventive medicine in the
way of improved hygiene--better drainage, better ventilation, etc.--is
contributing largely to the longevity of the race, we unfortunately
encounter in more recent times an antagonizing influence in the elegant
art of cookery.Every conceivable ingenuity is resorted to to tempt men
to eat more than their stomachs can properly or easily digest or
tissue-changes require.The injurious consequences of such over-feeding
may finally correct itself by destroying the capacity of the stomach to
digest the food.But, on the other hand, in many nervous forms of dyspepsia the weak
stomach is not unfrequently made weaker by severely restricted regimen,
and especially is this the case with mental workers.Theoretical and
fanciful considerations sometimes lead to physical starvation.This is
apt to be the case with dyspeptics.Men who toil with their brain
rather than their muscles, whether dyspeptic or not, require good,
easily-digested mixed diet.It is a popular error to suppose that drugs
can take the place of such food, especially drugs which are supposed to
have a reconstructive influence over the nervous system, such as iron
and phosphorus.The expression of Buchner, "No thinking without
phosphorus," captivating to theoretical minds, has gained much
notoriety, and has doubtless led to the excessive use of that drug in
nervous forms of indigestion.There never was a period when phosphorus
was so universally prescribed as the present.It enters into endless
combinations with so-called nerve-tonics.Of the injurious influence of
the drug in many cases of functional indigestion there can be no doubt;
and the statement itself, so often quoted, that "the amount of
phosphorus in the blood passing through the brain bears an exact
proportion to the intensity of thought," is calculated to mislead.T.
K. Chambers, author of the excellent _Manual of Diet_, makes the
statement that "a captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare assimilates and
parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking man;
while the beaver, noted for its power of contrivance, excretes so
little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in its
excreta."In the wonderful adaptations and regulative mechanisms of
nature we may trust largely to the natural law of supply and demand in
maintaining a proper equilibrium.It may be doubted, indeed, whether we
require at any time more phosphorus for brain- and nerve-tissue than
can be found in such food as contains digestible phosphatic salts.The
natural demand for food grows out of healthy tissue-change.An appetite
to be healthy should commence in processes outside of the stomach.Food may also be introduced into the stomach in an undigestible form
{445} from defects of cookery.The process of cooking food produces
certain well-known chemical changes in alimentary substances which
render them more digestible than in the uncooked state.By the use of
fire in cooking his food new sources of strength have been opened up to
man which have doubtless contributed immeasurably to his physical
development, and has led to his classification as the cooking animal.With regard to most articles the practice of cooking his food
beforehand is wellnigh universal; and especially is this the case with
all farinaceous articles of food.The gluten of wheat is almost
indigestible in the uncooked state.By the process of cooking the
starchy matter of the grain is not only liberated from its protecting
envelopes, but it is converted into a gelatinous condition which
readily yields to the diastasic ferments.Roberts, in his lectures on
the _Digestive Ferments_, points out the fact that when men under the
stress of circumstances have been compelled to subsist on uncooked
grains of the cereals, they soon fell into a state of inanition and
disease.Animal diet is also more easily digested in the cooked than in the raw
state.The advantage consists chiefly in the effects of heat on the
connective tissue and in the separation of the muscular fibre.In this
respect cooking aids the digestive process.The gastric juice cannot
get at the albumen-containing fibrillae until the connective tissue is
broken up, removed, or dissolved.Hot water softens and removes this
connective tissue.Hence raw meat is less easily digestible.Carnivorous animals, that get their food at long intervals, digest it
slowly.John journeyed to the garden.By cutting, bruising, and scraping meat we to a certain extent
imitate the process of cooking.In many cases, indeed, ill-nourished
children and dyspeptics digest raw beef thus comminuted better than
cooked, and it is a matter of observation that steamed and underdone
roast meats are more digestible than when submitted to greater heat.Some interesting observations have been made by Roberts on the effects
of the digestive ferments on cooked and uncooked albuminoids.He
employed in his experiments a solution of egg albumen made by mixing
white of egg with nine times its volume of water."This solution," says
Roberts, "when boiled in the water-bath does not coagulate nor sensibly
change its appearance, but its behavior with the digestive ferments is
completely altered.In the raw state this solution is attacked very
slowly by pepsin and acid, and pancreatic extract has no effect on it;
but after being cooked in the water-bath the albumen is rapidly and
entirely digested by artificial gastric juice, and a moiety of it is
rapidly digested by pancreatic extract."It is a mistake, however, to suppose that cooking is equally necessary
for all kinds of albuminoids.The oyster, at least, is quite
exceptional, for it contains a digestive ferment--the hepatic
diastase--which is wholly destroyed by cooking.Milk may be
indifferently used either in the cooked or uncooked state, and fruits,
which owe their value chiefly to sugar, are not altered by cooking.The object in introducing here these remarks on cooking food is to show
that it forms an important integral part of the work of digestion, and
has a direct bearing on the management of all forms of dyspepsia.Haste in eating, with imperfect mastication, is a common cause of
indigestion in this country.Mastication is the first step in the
digestive {446} process.It is important, therefore, that we have good
teeth and that we take time to thoroughly masticate our food, for by so
doing we prepare it for being acted upon by the juices of the stomach.Time is also necessary in order that the salivary secretion may be
incorporated with the alimentary substances.By the salivary diastase
starch is converted into sugar and albuminoids are prepared for the
action of the gastric juice.If these changes take place imperfectly,
the stomach can scarcely regain in gastric digestion what was lost in
imperfect mastication and insalivation.Haste in eating is one of the
American vices.It grows out of the temperament of our people.We are
jealous of lost time, and unfortunately this time is too often taken
from the stomach.We bolt our food with unseemly haste, and pay the
penalty in ruined stomachs.Many cases of indigestion are greatly
relieved, if not permanently cured, by simply doubling or quadrupling
the time occupied in eating.Irregularity in the intervals between meals, such as taking one meal
only in twenty-four hours or taking food before the preceding supply
has been digested, is another fruitful source of indigestion.The
digestive process, in the natural order of change, is confused; changes
which should take place are delayed; and the results are such as arise
from excessive eating.Moreover, the stomach lacks the rest so
essential to digestion.The necessary interval, however, between meals
varies with the nature of the food taken."Between the extremes of the
carnivorae," says Ewald, "which feed once in twenty-four hours, and the
herbivorae, which never have done with the business of feeding, man
holds a middle place, but not without permitting the recognition in the
course of his life of a sort of transition from the herbivora to the
carnivora.Infants should have the breast during the first three weeks
as often as they wake; after that every two hours to the third month;
then up to dentition every three hours; and later there should be five
meals in twenty-four hours."But to this general statement there are,
of course, many exceptions.Under certain pathological conditions food
should be taken in small quantities at short intervals.This is
especially the case in chronic gastric catarrh and in feeble digestion
of nervous subjects.Such patients are not unfrequently improved by
becoming again infants or herbivorae.By the use of an exclusive milk
diet or peptonized milk gruels, given in small quantities at
comparatively short intervals of time, the stomach may be so
accommodated that it will digest without discomfort a large amount of
nourishment within a given time.To S. Weir Mitchell of Philadelphia we
are indebted for some valuable observations bearing upon this point of
forced alimentation.To the causes of indigestion already alluded to may be added the habit
of spirit-drinking, especially the habit of taking alcohol undiluted on
an empty stomach, which rarely fails after a time to engender dyspeptic
symptoms.It is a prominent factor in the production of chronic gastric
catarrh--a condition more frequently present in painful indigestion
than any that have been named.It is one of the most common diseases
met with in practice.Indeed, all causes already alluded to involve,
sooner or later, if they are constantly operative, irritative and
catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, so that we
find it difficult at times--indeed impossible--to separate purely
functional from subacute inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.Practically,
we simply study the {447} subject in the relative degrees of prominence
of the one condition or the other.But, in a still more comprehensive sense, indigestion is caused by
disturbance of organs directly associated with the stomach in the
digestive process.All organs closely associated with each other in
their physiological functions are apt to become associated in morbid
action.The clinical recognition of this is a matter of great
importance in the management of gastric affections.And first in the
order of importance in such association is the liver.So closely,
indeed, are the liver and stomach functionally associated in the
process of primary assimilation that they may be considered parts of
the same great digestive apparatus.Hence disturbance of the
liver--either in the formation of glycogen, the destruction of
albuminoid matter, or the secretion of bile--is immediately
communicated to the stomach.It may be difficult to say which of these
separate and distinct functions of the liver is most at fault; that can
only be a matter of physiological inference.In the one case, for
instance, the dyspeptic may be fairly well nourished, yet his
elimination may be bad.In the other there is no failure of the
destructive and excreting functions, but those concerned in the
assimilation of fat and peptones are disordered, so that the patient is
not well nourished, so far as the fatty element is concerned.This is
the more common form, and a form not unfrequently associated with
pulmonary consumption.The liver finally becomes fatty--a condition
usually found associated with the constitutional forms of phthisis.The pancreas is also closely associated with the stomach, and its
secretion is of essential value in the digestive process.It is to be
regretted that our precise knowledge of its diseases is in such
striking contrast with its importance in the animal economy, and yet it
can scarcely be doubted that in dyspeptic symptoms associated with
failure of digestion of starchy, albuminous, and fatty elements of food
there is disorder of the secretion of the pancreas.Hence in the
treatment of the early stages of pulmonary consumption and other
disorders associated with deficient digestion and assimilation of fatty
substances the importance of directing our attention to the condition
of the liver and pancreas, as well as to the stomach.That morbid states of the intestinal track occupy a prominent place in
the etiology of dyspepsia is also a well-recognized clinical fact.Indeed, constipation of the bowels is an almost universal accompaniment
of deranged digestion, and when persistent for years it is apt to lead
to the most disastrous consequences.These are mainly in the direction
of lessened elimination from the intestinal glandulae.The general
symptomatology of deficient excretion from these glandulae is closely
analogous to the same condition of the liver: there is impairment of
the general health; the clear florid complexion disappears; the patient
becomes of a greenish or sallow hue; the blood is altered in quality;
fatigue is experienced after the slightest exertion; the nights are
restless; and there is great tendency to mental despondency.Moreover,
constipation often precedes the gastric symptoms.The diminished
muscular activity of the intestinal track extends to the stomach; its
movements are diminished; food is not properly mixed with the gastric
juice, and by being too long retained in the stomach in a comparatively
undigested state acetous fermentation in the saccharine and starchy
articles of diet is set {448} up, acid eructations and a sour taste in
the mouth being commonly complained of.Dyspepsia associated with this
condition of the intestinal track cannot be relieved until the
constipation is relieved, and by overcoming the constipation the
dyspeptic symptoms often disappear.Mention has been made of the baneful influence of certain mental states
in the production of dyspeptic symptoms.But there are forms of
indigestion due to local nervous disturbance existing elsewhere than in
the nerve-centres.This was ascribed by the older writers to what they
termed consensus nervorum, or sympathy, by which "the operation of a
stimulus is not limited to the nerves immediately irritated, but is
extended to distant parts in known or unknown connection with the
irritated nerves."An intimate acquaintance with this law of sympathy
is of the utmost importance in the study of the functional forms of
dyspepsia, for no other organ of the body is subjected to such a wide
range of reflected nervous disturbance as the stomach.Morbid
sympathetic impressions are transmitted mainly through branches of the
vaso-motor nerve of the semilunar ganglia of the abdomen, and from the
pneumogastric to the stomach.Thus, a pregnant uterus not unfrequently
produces very troublesome vomiting; some females suffer from nausea and
indigestion during each menstrual period; and the more chronic forms of
pelvic irritation, such as a flexed uterus, and endometritis,
cervicitis, or tender ovary, may be the continuous exciting cause of
most troublesome forms of nervous dyspepsia.There is also close
sympathy of the stomach with the lungs and heart through the
distribution of the pneumogastric.So also may fixed points of
irritation in any part of the nervous system be reflexly transmitted to
the stomach, giving rise to most pronounced symptoms of indigestion.And it is evident that in all such cases but little can be accomplished
in the way of relieving the dyspeptic symptoms until the cause upon
which they depend is removed.The treatment must have reference mainly
to the removal of such cause.Lastly, all the causes mentioned finally concur in producing
irregularities of the mechanism of digestion; and this may be done by
disturbing either the muscular movements of the stomach or in
suspending or perverting the gastric solvents, or in these two
conditions combined.Referable to the Stomach.--The symptoms which attend
and indicate the presence of functional dyspepsia are such as accompany
in a greater or less degree almost all cases of chronic gastritis.Clinically, so far as the direct gastric symptoms are concerned, it is
difficult to separate them.The more prominent of the local symptoms
are--a sense of fulness and distension after meals, discomfort during
the digestive process, derangement of appetite, acid eructations,
flatulence, regurgitations of food, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.There is seldom severe pain; the sensation is rather that of
uneasiness.Exceptionally, however, there may be pain, which radiates
from the stomach to the shoulders, and may pass down the left arm so as
to simulate angina pectoris.But it may be readily distinguished from
that complaint by coming on after food, and not after exertion.In
other cases a sense of constriction may be accompanied by dyspnoea,
arising from impeded movements of the diaphragm from being pushed
upward by the distended stomach, or there may be heartburn, with an
ill-defined sense of burning felt in the epigastrium; {449} but thirst,
so frequently present in chronic gastritis, is, as a rule, absent in
functional dyspepsia.These symptoms are manifested in varying degrees
of prominence in individual cases, and some of them are rarely found
present.Thus, nausea and vomiting are not characteristic features of
the chronic forms of functional dyspepsia, and as a rule epigastric
tenderness is entirely absent.In markedly hysterical subjects or in
persons whose nervous system has been unduly excited by alcohol there
may be shrinking from the slightest touch upon pressure; but in these
cases the tenderness is not confined to the stomach, nor is it
increased by deep pressure.In some cases there is an unnatural craving
for food--a symptom rarely if ever observed in structural lesions of
the stomach--and now and then it happens that the appetite becomes
depraved, especially with hysterical patients.They crave indigestible
and unnatural substances, such as earth, chalk, and substances wholly
devoid of alimentary properties.Impairment of appetite, however, is
the more common feature of this form of indigestion.Flatulence and eructations are generally complained of, the flatulence
being accompanied by a painful sense of fulness, affecting in equal
degree the stomach and small intestines.It is derived principally from
putrefactive or fermentative changes of the ingesta, which are
imperfectly elaborated in the stomach.The gases consist of carbonic
acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and the hydrocarbons,
the butyric and acetic fermentations furnishing the hydrogen and
carbonic acid gas.In addition to these marsh gas is formed by a
special fermentation, the basis of which exists in the cellulose taken
with vegetable food.In excessive meteorism from paralysis of the
intestines the gas is principally nitrogen; the marsh-gas fermentation
results from the ingestion of certain easily-fermentable vegetables,
such as cabbage, cauliflower, etc.In a certain proportion of cases regurgitation occurs from the stomach.The liquor regurgitated may be intensely acid from the presence of some
of the fatty acids, probably butyric, lactic, or acetic.Exceptionally,
it may be insipid or brackish, constituting what is known as pyrosis,
or water-brash.The fluid is usually tasteless and without smell, and
in reaction it is neutral to test-paper.It contains sulphocyanuret of
potassium, and it has been supposed therefore to be only saliva.The
quantity thrown up may vary from a spoonful to a pint or more.It
affects females more than males, and especially those who subsist upon
coarse and indigestible food.It is best treated by astringents--such
as kino, krameria, logwood, or tannin--administered in the intervals
between digestion, so that they may act directly on the mucous
membrane.The oxide and nitrate of silver are thought by some to be
superior to the vegetable astringents.Cardialgia is a painful condition of the stomach, usually referred to
its cardiac orifice, and is popularly known as heartburn.It is met
with in both functional and organic disease of the stomach.It is very
constantly present in chronic catarrhal gastritis, and evidently
depends upon the presence of an acid, for it is usually promptly
relieved by alkalies, such as chalk, magnesia, soda, or alkaline saline
waters.Food containing much fat, starch, or sugar should be avoided.Nausea and vomiting are only occasional symptoms of functional
dyspepsia.When vomiting does occur it may take place at different
times {450} and with varying degrees of severity, differing in this
respect from the nausea and vomiting of subacute gastritis, which takes
place, if at all, soon after the ingestion of food.The time of
vomiting and the character of the matter ejected are liable to great
variation in functional dyspepsia.It may be the result of direct
irritation of morbidly sensitive gastric nerves, or it may be a reflex
phenomenon; it may follow soon after the ingestion of food, or it may
come on when the stomach is empty; the material vomited may be simply
food but little altered or an alkaline ropy mucus; it may consist in
the acid juices of the stomach or in a neutral watery fluid; or the
ingesta may have undergone fermentative and putrefactive changes from
either insufficient amount of the gastric solvent or from narrowing
(constriction) of the pyloric extremity, in which case the yeast fungus
(Torula cerevisiae) or the Sarcina ventriculi may be found in great
abundance in the vomited matter.Vomiting of this kind usually occurs
some time after eating.The gastric juice itself checks putrefaction;
so also does the admixture of bile.In the absence of these natural
antiseptics fermentation takes place.But it would be erroneous to
suppose that the fermentative dyspepsia is the primary disease; it is a
symptom which can be permanently corrected only by correcting the
condition upon which it depends.Among the most noticeable of the phenomena referable to other organs
than the stomach are those connected with the liver and the alimentary
canal.The tongue in dyspeptic troubles varies much in character.In
reflex sympathetic indigestion it is not unfrequently clean; in hepatic
dyspepsia it is generally thickly coated with a white or yellow fur.The symptoms are such as pertain more especially to chronic
gastro-duodenal catarrh, such as nausea, epigastric oppression, furred
tongue, heartburn, acid eructations, flatulent distension of the
stomach and bowels, unpleasant taste in the mouth, offensive breath,
loaded urine, frontal headache, irritability, and hypochondriasis.Constipation, as we have seen, is an almost universal accompaniment of
functional dyspepsia, sustaining to it not unfrequently a causative
relation.It is undoubtedly one of the most common of the slighter
ailments of civilized life, and exerts a wide influence in deranging
the general health."It is quite extraordinary how many different
derangements of health may result from imperfect action or a torpid
state of the secreting and expelling structures of the large bowel.There may be violent and persistent nerve-pains, referred to the back,
or hip, or groin, and certain other symptoms which lead pessimist
practitioners, excelling in the discovery of neuroses, to diagnose
structural changes in some part of the spinal cord or the antecedent
state which is supposed to lead to them" (Beale).Pains in the loins
and thighs, violent lumbar pain, and certain remediable forms of
sciatica are sometimes due to imperfect excretion of the lower part of
the alimentary canal.And it is even possible that a condition of
hypochondria bordering on insanity may be brought about by
long-continued defective action of the bowels.In exceptional cases of
dyspepsia diarrhoea may be present.This is more frequently the case
when indigestion is associated with a congested state of the liver, in
which case the symptom should be regarded as curative.Excessive
irritability of the muscular walls of the stomach, superadded to weak
digestion, may also be followed by lienteric forms of diarrhoea.Undigested {451} food hastily finds its way into the intestinal track,
and not unfrequently appears in the fecal evacuations.Functional derangements of the stomach are often accompanied by pale
urate deposits in the urine.It may contain an excess of phosphates,
and in microscopical examination crystals of the oxalate of lime are
frequently found, constituting a special affection described by
Golding-Bird as oxaluria.He associated it with irritative dyspepsia,
hypochondriasis, and exhaustion of nerve-power.This form of dyspepsia
is best managed by the mineral, vegetable, and acid tonics, to which
may be added small doses of nux vomica, with the usual adjuvants of
good air and exercise, freedom from anxiety and care, cold sea-water
baths, and well-selected, generous animal diet.Another form of dyspepsia is sometimes associated with a peculiar form
of dizziness--gastric vertigo.German writers speak of it as abdominal
dizziness, and Trousseau calls it vertigo stomicale.It is usually an
acute symptom, begins without any premonition, and is liable to be
confounded with disease of the brain.It sometimes occurs soon after a
meal, but more often when the stomach is empty (Trousseau).It perhaps,
in a majority of cases, depends upon dyspepsia, but it has to be
differentiated from organic brain disease, from cerebral anaemia,
cerebral hyperaemia, the slighter forms of epilepsy, Miniere's disease,
and general nervous exhaustion and depression.But in many cases it
will be found that treatment directed against the dyspepsia cures the
vertigo.Dyspeptic patients are also liable to skin diseases, and especially is
this observed in the gastro-duodenal forms of indigestion.Disorders of
the skin, such as urticaria, erythema, lichen, eczema, and other allied
conditions, are well-recognized external indications at times of
disordered conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.Thus,
it is a matter of common observation that the gastric symptoms increase
when the eruption on the surface disappears.The general influence of the nervous system over the function of
digestion is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the disease, so
that disturbed innervation becomes conspicuous in its symptomatology.Languor, drowsiness after
taking food, depression of spirits, irritability, hypochondriasis,
sleeplessness, palpitation, dry cough, dyspnoea, are all of common
occurrence; and the mental disturbance--the anxiety, gloom, and
sadness--is to many dyspeptics more distressing than absolute pain.It is impossible, however, to present, in this connection, a complete
clinical history of functional dyspepsia, for the reason that it is
associated with so many separate and distinct affections, the dyspepsia
itself being symptomatic of these affections.PATHOLOGY.--But little is known of the pathology of the purely
functional forms of dyspepsia beyond what is expressed by the terms
atony and asthenia.These express simply certain states of the system
with which atonic dyspepsia is so frequently found associated.Pathological anatomy has shown, however, that some cases are dependent
upon, or associated with, certain appreciable alterations of the
stomach, such as atrophy of the mucous membrane or fatty degeneration
of its walls; and not unfrequently it is the seat of the so-called
amyloid or lardaceous degeneration, although this albuminoid
infiltration or cloudy {452} swelling is more frequently the
accompaniment of chronic inflammatory process.But Jones and Fenwick
have shown that these conditions may occur independently of
inflammation.However, upon this point we are compelled to speak with
caution.The boundary-line between functional and structural diseases
is not always clearly defined.Functional and structural troubles of
the stomach are certainly very intimately associated.Moreover,
symptoms of purely functional dyspepsia are so frequently associated
with the subacute forms of gastritis that the pathology of the disease
becomes, from necessity, doubtful and complex.It can only be studied
in connection with certain states or conditions of which functional
derangement of the stomach is a symptom readily recognized during life.In the light of more advanced physiological and pathological researches
we may expect the limits of purely functional dyspepsia to be much
restricted.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of atonic dyspepsia must have special
reference to its etiology.It is usually a chronic disease, and has to
be discriminated from subacute or chronic inflammation of the stomach.This is the more difficult because many symptoms exist in common in
both varieties of indigestion.But in functional or atonic dyspepsia
the symptoms are not so continuous; there is less epigastric
uneasiness, less tenderness, less nausea or loathing of food, less
thirst, and less acidity and heartburn, less emaciation, less cerebral
and nervous disturbance, and the constitutional symptoms are also less
severe.The tongue, as a rule, is not so thickly coated, is not so red
or broad and flabby, the papillae are less marked, the breath less
offensive, and the urine, instead of showing a condition of lithaemia,
is not unfrequently pale and sometimes neutral, depositing oxalates and
phosphates, especially in feeble, broken-down conditions of the nervous
system.With other painful affections of the stomach, such as ulcer and cancer,
it is not likely to be confounded, especially when in these affections
pain, vomiting, and haematemesis are present.TREATMENT.--The first and leading indication is to remove, as far as
possible, all causes of the disease, and this requires patient research
and much diagnostic skill.Suggestive hints of treatment may be found
in connection with the discussion of the varied etiology of the
disease.We can, in conclusion, only allude to the matter in a very
general way.Special cases must furnish their own indications of
treatment.In many cases a condition of nervous asthenia will be found prominently
present.A leading indication, therefore, irrespective of the special
determining cause, is to improve the general health of the patient; and
this is accomplished by all means which invigorate the system
generally.And first in the order of importance are diet and regimen.It is evident that if a patient eat too much or too often, or if he eat
indigestible or unwholesome food, or lead an indolent and luxurious
life, nothing can be accomplished by way of drugs in the relief of the
disease.Excessive alimentation is, as we have seen, a most prolific
source of the disease.Tempted to excess by great variety and by the
ingenuity of culinary refinements, the stomach is burdened beyond its
capacity of digestion and beyond the actual requirements of the system;
and especially is this the case with those who live sedentary, indoor
lives.In all such cases it is absolutely essential that the digestive
organs have rest.{453} Better even in cases of doubt reduce the diet
for a time below the actual wants of the system until waste products
are thoroughly removed and appetite is revived.The benefit derived in
some instances from the protracted use of purgative mineral waters is
largely attributable to the restricted regimen enforced and to the
washing out of the system the waste products.On the other hand, too great or too protracted abstemiousness may
equally impair the digestive process.In ordinary forms of atonic
dyspepsia we should seek rather, by appropriate treatment, to raise the
digestive capacity to the level of digesting good, healthy, nutritious
food, than to reduce the food to the low standard of feeble digestion.But it is a mistake to suppose that this can be accomplished by simply
forcing food upon a stomach that lacks capacity of digestion.As to the kind of diet, no precise rule is suited to all cases.Within
certain limits individual experience must be consulted.But these
experiences are not always reliable.Dyspeptic patients, more than any
others, are apt to have fancies.Certain general rules, therefore,
should be insisted upon.The food should be wholesome and digestible;
it should be well cooked, well masticated, and taken at regular and not
too long intervals.The intervals of time between meals depend upon
circumstances already referred to.In some cases small quantities of
easily-digested food should be taken at short intervals.In cases of
feeble digestion of nervous subjects milk diluted in Seltzer water, or
milk and lime-water, or peptonized milk, may be taken in liberal
quantities at comparatively short intervals of time.Sometimes
isinglass, arrowroot, or ground rice may be advantageously combined
with the milk, to which tender, undone meats may be added.Peptonized Food.--Recently the attention of the profession has been
attracted to artificially digested food.The essential acts of
digestion are known to be chemical transmutations.Albuminoid
substances are changed into peptones and starchy matters are changed
into dextrin and sugar.To Roberts, in his excellent lectures delivered
in the Lumleian course before the Royal College of Physicians of London
in 1880, we are indebted for valuable information on the digestive
ferments and in the preparation and use of artificially-digested food;
and from these lectures we shall derive most of the information we
possess at present.It has been demonstrated that an extract of the
stomach or pancreas, in water, has to a certain extent the same powers
as the natural secretions of these organs.Hence, says Roberts, it is
possible for us to subject articles of food beforehand to complete or
partial digestion.Heat approximatively accomplishes the same thing.In
the practice of cookery we have, as it were, a foreshadowing of this
art of artificial digestion.Heat and digestive ferments alike aid
gastric digestion.In case of the lower animals the whole process has
to be accomplished by the labor of their own digestive organs.Artificially digested food may be prepared in two ways--either by
following the gastric method with pepsin and hydrochloric acid, or by
following the intestinal method and using extract of pancreas.Both of
these plans have had special advocates.Roberts claims that the latter
yields by far the better results."The pancreas not only acts upon
albuminous substances, but also upon starch.Pepsin, on the other hand,
is {454} quite inert in regard to starch.Moreover, the products of
artificial digestion with pepsin and acid are much less agreeable to
the taste and smell than those produced by pancreatic extract."The
pancreas of the pig, according to Roberts, yields the most active
preparation, but the pancreas of the ox or the sheep may be employed.The pancreas of the calf is not active on starchy materials.A very
active extract of pancreas is now prepared, and is easily obtainable,
with directions for making peptonized milk, milk gruel, milk punch,
soups, jellies, blanc-manges, beef-tea, enemata, etc.It is important
to remember that peptonized foods do not keep well, especially in warm
weather.If a quantity sufficient for twenty-four hours be prepared at
any one time, the quantity which remains over twelve hours should be
reboiled before using.Food thus peptonized is indicated in feeble
conditions of digestion and when the derangement of digestion results
from causes pertaining to the condition of the stomach itself--_i.e._
catarrhal forms of dyspepsia.As a rule, the food should be such as will require the least possible
exertion on the part of the stomach.Raw vegetables should be
forbidden; pastries, fried dishes, and all rich and greasy compounds
should be eschewed; and whatever food be taken should be eaten slowly
and well masticated.Many patients digest animal better than vegetable
food.Tender brown meats, plainly but well cooked, such as beef,
mutton, and game, are to be preferred.Lightly-cooked mutton is more
digestible than beef, pork, or lamb, and roast beef is more digestible
than boiled.Pork and veal and salted and preserved meats are
comparatively indigestible.Bread should never be eaten hot or
fresh--better be slightly stale--and bread made from the whole meal is
better than that made from the mere starchy part of the grain.Milk and
eggs and well-boiled rice are of special value.But to all these general dietetic rules there may be exceptions growing
out of the peculiarities of individual cases.The aged, for obvious reasons, require less food than the
young; the middle-aged, inclined to obesity and troubled with feeble
digestion, should avoid potatoes, sweets, and fatty substances and
spirituous liquors; persons suffering from functional derangements of
the liver should be put, for a time, on the most restricted regimen;
while, on the contrary, the illy fed and badly-nourished require the
most nutritious food that can be digested with comfort to the patient.The general regimen should be tonic and invigorating.The patient
should have the benefit of the best possible hygiene.Under this head
may be mentioned suitable clothing, fresh air, moderate exercise,
sunlight, baths, rest, regular hours, and the abandonment of all bad
habits.No single measure has such marked influence on the digestive
powers of the stomach as systematic, well-regulated muscular exercise
in the open air, and especially if the exercise be accompanied by a
cheerful mental state.Hunting, fishing, boating, are known to excite the keenest appetite for
food, and the stomach will digest substances that would distress it
under other circumstances.Exhaustion, however, is to be carefully
avoided.Horseback exercise is a remedy of much value, especially in
the hepatic forms of indigestion.The mental and moral treatment of the purely functional forms of {455}
indigestion are amongst the most powerful means we possess.As an
etiological factor certain morbid mental states rank first, as we have
seen, in the order of importance.Grief, despondency, and despair are
effectual barriers to digestion, and in a less degree mental worry
seriously interferes with the process.It is a matter of prime
importance, therefore, that the patient's mind be pleasantly occupied,
that he should be free from all care and mental worry, and that he
especially be kept from dwelling, if possible, upon his own bodily
ailments.This is often best accomplished by travel, when practicable,
in foreign countries, where everything will be novel and new and
calculated to lead him away from himself.Get him to travel, says
Watson, in search of his health, and the chances are in favor of his
finding it.We have the authority of Sir James Johnson also for saying
that no case of purely functional dyspepsia can resist a pedestrian
tour over the Alps.We come now to discuss the medical treatment of dyspepsia, which,
though not unimportant, is subordinate to the general hygienic measures
already referred to.General hints of treatment have been made in
connection with special causes mentioned in the text.We seek, in a
general way, by therapeutic measures--

1st.To stimulate the secreting and muscular coats of the stomach;

2d.To supply materials in which it is supposed the gastric juice is
defective;

3d.To lessen abnormal irritability;

4th.To combat special symptoms or conditions which may hinder the
digestive process.To meet these indications innumerable remedies have been recommended,
but they are of benefit only as they counteract the conditions upon
which the dyspepsia depends.For loss of appetite, if there are no
contraindications to their use, the vegetable bitters are often useful,
such as quassia, gentian, and columbo.Of these columbo is the simplest
of its class, but none more generally useful than mistura gentianae
with soda.The Hydrastis canadensis has also peculiar claims as a
bitter stomachic.It, perhaps more than any of the bitters, promotes
gastric secretion in feeble digestion, and has at the same time
peculiar salutary effects on the enfeebled condition of the chronically
inflamed gastric mucous membrane.It is supposed also to have a
stimulating effect on the pancreatic secretion.It may be given in the
form of a fluid extract combined with glycerin and small doses of nux
vomica.Among the specific stimulating nerve-tonics, nux vomica, or its
alkaloid, strychnia, deserves special mention.In small tonic doses it
is specially indicated in conditions of general nervous prostration
associated with a tendency to hypochondriasis.In such cases we
frequently observe pale urine, containing an excess of the phosphates.The mineral acids are valuable additions to the bitter tonics in all
broken-down conditions of the nervous system.In administering nux
vomica care should be taken as to limitation of time and dose.The
excessive or prolonged use of the drug is apt to produce serious
general nervous disturbance, the secondary condition being often the
opposite to that for which it was prescribed.Temporary saccharine
diabetes is not unfrequently one of the results.In atony of the mucous membrane, with morbid sensibility and slow {456}
digestion, ipecacuanha is a remedy of much value.It was first brought
into prominent notice in connection with gastric affections by Budd,
since which time it has been more or less used by the profession.In
torpid, slow digestion, with depraved or lessened gastric secretion, it
is of undoubted value.It should be given on an empty stomach at least
half an hour before meals.The dose should be short of producing
nausea.We may commence with two to four drops of the tincture or wine
of ipecac, and gradually increase until we find the point of tolerance;
or it may be given in the form of pill in doses of a quarter or a half
grain before meals, combining it with rhubarb in three- or four-grain
doses.Ipecacuanha may be administered at the same time we are giving
the mineral acids, or mineral acids with pepsin.Adjuvants to Digestion.--In atony of the stomach the gastric mucous
membrane responds feebly to the stimulus of food.There is failure in
both muscular movement and gastric secretion, with slowness of
digestion as a result.To meet this condition we seek to increase the
digestive power by the addition of certain principles natural to the
digestive process--viz.the mineral acids, pepsin, and pancreatin.Of
these acids, the hydrochloric should be preferred, because it is the
natural acid of the gastric juice.Lactic, nitro-hydrochloric, and
phosphoric acids have also been used with benefit.There can be no
doubt of the efficacy of either of these preparations.They are best
given when the stomach is empty, so that they may directly act on the
relaxed atonic mucous membrane.Half an hour before or two hours after
a meal is the best time for their administration, and to be of benefit
they should be administered for a length of time.From fifteen to
twenty minims of the dilute hydrochloric or nitro-hydrochloric acid may
be given in some bitter tincture or infusion for months.An elegant
preparation may be made by adding the acid to tincture of orange-peel
and syrup of lemon.Aromatic tincture, tincture of ginger, or glycerin
may be added in some cases.It is important that remedies administered
in gastric affections should be made pleasant as possible to the
patient.Metallic preparations are of use in some cases.If for any reason they
are preferred, the perchloride of iron is one of the very best
preparations.Arsenic and zinc may also be tried in small doses.Pepsin and its Uses.--Of the efficacy of pepsin as an artificial
substitute for the normal solvent of the food adverse opinions have
been expressed, but in spite of the most critical scepticism as to its
action its use since first introduced into medicine has steadily
increased.It has been shown to be the natural constituent of the
gastric juice and glands, and as a natural ferment, when combined with
hydrochloric acid, it constitutes the most important solvent of the
nitrogenous portions of our diet (Habershon).There is a vast number of
different preparations of pepsin in the market, and some of them are
doubtless of little value.We ought to be quite sure that the article
is what it purports to be.The pepsina porce is the best preparation,
one grain of which, says Beale, ought to thoroughly digest one hundred
grains of boiled white of egg in three or four hours at a temperature
of 100 degrees F. His test as to the value of pepsin is as follows:
"One hundred grains of hard-boiled white of egg, cut into thin slices,
may be placed in a wide-mouthed bottle or flask with one ounce of water
and twenty drops of dilute hydrochloric acid.One {457} grain of pepsin
powder is to be added, and the mixture placed before a fire at a
temperature of about 100 degrees F. The flask is to be shaken from time
to time.In about an hour the white of egg begins to look transparent
at the edges, and in about four hours it will be completely dissolved
if the pepsin is good."In cases of feeble digestion from deficiency of
gastric juice pepsin is a valuable adjuvant to the digestive power, and
may be given with advantage in connection with the mineral acids or
with ipecacuanha or capsicum before meals.Special Remedies.--There are certain symptoms characteristic of the
different forms and complications of dyspepsia that require special
remedies.It is especially indicated where
there is a morbid painful condition of the gastric nerves.The
subnitrate or carbonate of bismuth may be given in ten- or twenty-grain
doses, suspended in water by means of mucilage of acacia, and flavored
with ginger or peppermint.It should always be given on an empty
stomach.Other elegant preparations supposed to be improvements upon
these have been recommended, and may be tried.In cases of anaemia, if there are no contraindications, iron may be
tried.If digested and assimilated, it improves the blood, and this is
often the first step in the direction of restoring functional activity.Of the preparations of iron, none is perhaps superior to the
perchloride.The saccharo-carbonate and the ammonio-citrate are also
valuable and unirritating salts of iron, and may be given with other
tonics.Ferruginous mineral waters slightly charged with carbonic acid
are well tolerated in small doses.The free dilution favors the action,
and is frequently more acceptable to the stomach than the more
concentrated forms.From one-half to one glassful may be taken at a
time; and the use of iron in this form may be preceded or accompanied
by the administration of small doses of quinia and of the bitter
tonics.But it is a mistake to commence the treatment by the
indiscriminate use of iron, quinine, and nerve-tonics.The
contraindications to the use of iron are irritable and inflammatory
states of the mucous membrane, or dyspepsia associated with deranged
conditions of secretion, as manifested by dirty tongue and loaded
urine.When the nervous system is prominently at fault, nux vomica, arsenic,
and the nitrate and oxide of silver often prove to be valuable
remedies.Here also benefit may be derived from the lighter ferruginous
preparations; indeed, few combinations have greater influence over the
nervous system than the joint action of arsenic and iron.Much benefit
may also be derived, in special cases, from methodical
hydro-therapeutic treatment.If judiciously used it strengthens the
nervous system, stimulates the organic functions, and increases the
power of vital resistance.And in some cases of nervous dyspepsia
electricity gives good results.In all cases of nervous prostration as
much wholesome food should be taken as the stomach can easily digest.In hepatic forms of indigestion there is no substitute for an
occasional mercurial cathartic, for, notwithstanding adverse criticism,
clinical experience has taught the great value of this drug upon the
upper portion of the intestinal track.The mode of operation may be
doubtful, but the result is unquestionable.In functional disturbance
of the liver or morbid conditions of the upper portion of the
intestinal track, as indicated {458} by the loaded tongue, sallow
complexion, want of appetite, and lithaemia, no remedy will give so
much relief as a few broken doses of calomel, followed by a saline
aperient; or eight or ten grains of blue mass, with a grain of
ipecacuanha, may be administered at bedtime, followed by a saline
draught in the morning.After the bowels are thoroughly unloaded by a
mercurial, great advantage may be derived from a systematic course of
the aperient mineral waters--the Friedrichshall, the Hunyadi, Carlsbad,
or some of the mineral waters of our own country.The hepatic form of
indigestion cannot be relieved until we relieve the congested hepatic
portal system, and this is best accomplished by the general line of
treatment here indicated.The simple vegetable bitters, with or without
alkalies, may be used at the same time or subsequent to this treatment;
but they are often worse than useless until we secure freedom of
abdominal circulation.The diet should be light and nourishing, and the
patient should spend most of his time out of doors.Horseback exercise
is peculiarly advantageous.But in many cases of the more chronic forms of dyspepsia the colon is
as atonic as the stomach, and therefore the bowels require special
attention.In colonic dyspepsia all active purgation should be avoided,
and salines, such as sulphate of magnesia, the Hunyadi and other saline
mineral waters, should be specially prohibited.The most useful
aperients in such cases are rhubarb, aloes, senna, colocynth, or
podophyllin.Few laxatives answer a better purpose than the ordinary
compound rhubarb pill.It may be improved, in special cases, by
combining with it extract of nux vomica or belladonna.When there is no
affection of the rectum to forbid its use, the watery extract of aloes
answers very well, and, unlike many cathartic substances, the dose need
not be increased, nor does it disturb the digestive process.It may be
given in one-sixth of a grain up to a grain or more, and its purgative
action may be improved by being reduced to a state of very minute
division and combining with it small doses of belladonna.Belladonna
itself is a useful remedy.According to the observations of Harley, it
"tones and tightens the longitudinal fibre, while it relaxes the
circular;" and long before this theory of its action was suggested,
Trousseau called attention to its singular efficacy in producing easy
and natural evacuations from the bowels.It is important to observe its
mode of use.It should be given in sixth of a grain doses of the
extract in the morning a half hour or hour before breakfast.Its
efficacy may be increased by combining with it small doses of the
watery extract of aloes.In colicky conditions of the bowels two- or
three-drop doses of tincture of colocynth sometimes act wonderfully
well.In obstinate constipation the free use of diluents at the
termination of digestion is often attended with excellent results.But
the hygienic and dietetic treatment of constipation is even more
important than the medicinal, such as outdoor exercise, the cold bath,
rubbing, kneading the bowels, and the use of bread made of whole meal,
oatmeal, and an abundant supply of fresh vegetables and fruits.Nausea and vomiting, occasional symptoms of functional dyspepsia, may
be relieved by various agents, such as effervescing draughts,
lime-water, oxalate of cerium, hydrocyanic acid, creasote, ice, and
alkalies.When vomiting is dependent on fermentation or putrid action of the
contents of the stomach with development of sarcinae, it may be checked
{459} by carbolic acid or by creasote, or by the sulphite of soda or
sulphurous acid; and in irritable conditions of the stomach bismuth is
a valuable remedy.It may be given with alkalies or with
finely-triturated animal charcoal.Gastric pain needs treatment appropriate to the circumstances under
which it arises.Sometimes it is relieved by regulating the ingesta or
the intervals at which it is taken; sometimes by warm carminative
stimulants or by chloric ether, ginger, or brandy.If the pain is more
constant, approaching a condition of gastralgia, hydrocyanic acid and
bismuth are more effective remedies.But it cannot be too strongly
stated, in conclusion, that in the management of the atonic forms of
dyspepsia hygienic treatment is of prime importance.The hopeful future
of medicine lies in the direction of promoting healthy nutrition, and
this is best accomplished by the careful adaptation of food and
exercise and modes of living to individual cases of disease.Gastralgia (Gastrodynia, Cardialgia, Spasm of the Stomach).Under the head of neuroses of the stomach have been variously described
the conditions indicated in the heading of this section; and a certain
amount of confusion has arisen in the use of these terms from the fact
that they represent subjective sensations common alike to organic and
functional forms of indigestion: pain, for instance, is felt in
gastritis, cancer of the stomach, and ulcer of the stomach.Indeed, it
rarely occurs independently of some disorder of digestion or structural
lesion of the stomach.By gastralgia, considered as a distinct affection, however, we mean a
purely neuralgic condition of the sensory fibres of the stomach,
excluding inflammatory and structural changes on the one hand and
chronic forms of atonic dyspepsia on the other.The attacks are usually
periodical in character, with constricting pain in the pit of the
stomach, and the intervals are not necessarily associated with symptoms
of dyspepsia.It chiefly occurs in females of nervous temperament at
the catamenial periods.Two forms of the disease have been described--one depending on
hyperaesthesia of the sensory fibres of the pneumogastric, the other on
hyperaesthesia of the solar plexus.This may be correct in theory, but
practically it can be of little importance to make the discrimination,
even if it were possible to do so.Clinically, the disease is presented to us in two forms.In one the
pain is agonizing, comes on without premonition, is sometimes
intermittent or remittent in character, and conveys to the sufferer the
idea of spasm; hence it has often been described as colic of the
stomach.If not relieved by appropriate remedies, the pain may last for
hours or days.In the other the pain is more of
a neuralgic character and is not so severe.There may be varying
exacerbations which may last for months or years.This is not an
unfrequent form, and may consist simply in the more acute form becoming
chronic.ETIOLOGY.--With the limitation indicated, we have naturally to seek the
causes of the affection, says Ziemssen, in two directions: either in
the abnormal nature of the irritants to which the gastric nerves are
subjected, {460} or in an altered condition of the nerves themselves,
which therefore react abnormally with the normal degree of irritation.This briefly covers the whole ground of the etiological relations of
the disease.The predisposing causes are such as produce general depressed vitality,
embracing at the same time special conditions of extreme nervous
excitability.Some of these general conditions were pointed out while
speaking of atonic forms of dyspepsia.Indeed, the two conditions are
often associated, and practically it may be difficult to separate them,
although the connection between them is not necessarily an invariable
one.Like atonic dyspepsia, gastralgia is apt to affect anaemic
persons, and notably anaemic females at menstrual periods.Thus, the
association between gastralgia, chlorosis, and hysteria is a matter of
common observation.Of 350 cases noted by Briquet, only 30 had no signs
of gastralgia; and this observation is a fair average expression of the
experience of others.Certain blood-poisons are also known to give rise to the disease.Infection of the blood by malaria was observed by Niemeyer to produce
spasm of the stomach instead of the paroxysms of intermittent fever;
and in malarious regions of the United States the same observation has
been made.Gout and rheumatism are also known to sustain causative
relations to the disease.Certain idiosyncrasies also enter as a factor
into the somewhat complex etiology of the disease.Thus, some persons
suffer immediately from eating certain kinds of food and fruits, such
as shellfish, strawberries, honey, and even milk and coffee.The pain
and spasm are produced by direct contact with the sensory fibres of the
stomach; _i.e._ they react abnormally to normal stimulation.But
disease of the nerve-centres may enter into the causation.This is seen
by the effects of morbid growths impinging upon nerve-trunks; their
terminal branches often become extremely irritable and painful, and
this condition may be intensified by idiosyncrasy.Excessive acidity of
the stomach, seeds of fruit, certain articles of food, the presence of
worms in the stomach, and draughts of ice-water may simply act as
exciting causes to a centric predisposition.Of the more direct causes operating upon nerve-centres, all the
depressing passions and emotions deserve special mention; so do all
causes which produce an exhausted state of innervation, such as
venereal excesses, onanism, the abuse of narcotics, etc.But chief among the causes are those of a reflex kind.Painful
affections of the kidneys, irritable conditions of the bladder,
diseases of the liver, and, above all, morbid conditions of the female
genital organs, sustain a direct and close relation to painful and
spasmodic conditions of the stomach.It is a common accompaniment of
versions, flexions, prolapses, inflammations, erosions of the os, as
well as diseased conditions of the ovaries.When such local conditions
are associated with anaemia and hysteria, patients rarely fail to have
painful gastric complications.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of gastralgia, like most of the neuroses, are
characterized by severe pain occurring in paroxysms, followed by
remissions, and sometimes by complete intermissions, again to recur
with varying degrees of severity.The pain in the acute variety is of a
violent, spasmodic character, and is referred to the epigastrium
immediately beneath the ensiform cartilage.Frequently it extends from
the epigastrium to the back and chest and into the right and left
hypochondrium.{461} No one has so briefly and so accurately described
the immediate attack of gastralgia as Romberg: "Suddenly, or after a
precedent feeling of pressure, there is severe griping pain in the pit
of the stomach, usually extending into the back, with a feeling of
faintness, shrunken countenance, cold hands and feet, and small,
intermittent pulse.The pain becomes so excessive that the patient
cries out.The epigastrium is either puffed out like a ball, or, as is
more frequently the case, retracted, with tension of the abdominal
walls.There is often pulsation in the epigastrium.External pressure
is well borne, and not unfrequently the patient presses the pit of the
stomach against some firm substance or compresses it with his hands.Sympathetic pains often occur in the thorax under the sternum, in the
oesophageal branches of the pneumogastric, while they are rare on the
exterior of the body.The attack lasts from a few minutes to half an
hour; then the pain gradually subsides, leaving the patient much
exhausted, or else it ceases suddenly with eructation of gas or watery
fluid, with vomiting, with a gentle soft perspiration, or with the
passage of reddish urine."Besides the violent paroxysmal pain referred to the stomach, symptoms
of derangement of other organs are often present.Prominent among these
are hysterical phenomena which are protean in their manifestations, and
if not recognized they are liable to mislead.Thus, with gastric pain
there may be violent palpitation of the heart, with shortness of
breath, cough, globus, hiccough, and convulsive affections, and in a
certain proportion of cases there is marked melancholia or
hypochondriasis.The stomach is variously modified in its function.In many cases it is
entirely unaffected.The desire for food may be indeed increased, and
its ingestion may give a sense of relief.In others vomiting may be
severe, while in still others there may be merely a condition of
anorexia.The tongue is, as a rule, clean, the skin cool, the
temperature undisturbed, and there is absence of tenderness over the
epigastrium.DIAGNOSIS.--Functional and structural troubles of the stomach very
markedly simulate each other; therefore the diagnosis requires to be
made with great caution, and this is best done by a most rigid and
careful exclusion; and this becomes difficult because the symptoms are
mainly subjective.It is a matter of great moment in differentiating the disease to take
into account all constitutional states which predispose to nervous
asthenia.Thus in conditions of chlorosis and hysteria the presumption
is strong that the pain is neurotic or spasmodic in character; and this
presumption is intensified if there be no accompanying constitutional
symptoms which indicate inflammatory action.We exclude inflammatory
conditions of the stomach by the frequent and complete intermissions,
by the absence of thirst, tenderness, and all febrile movement.Moreover, the pain of inflammatory affections, unless produced by
corrosive poisons, is rarely so severe as in neuralgic affections; nor
are nausea and vomiting so uniformly present in neurotic affections.Then the time at which the pain is experienced is a matter of
importance.In inflammatory affections it is felt immediately on taking
food.In neurotic affections it may occur when the stomach is empty,
and it is not unfrequently relieved by food.In ulcer and cancer of the
stomach pain is a common element, and, as in {462} gastralgia, it is
referred to the epigastrium.But in gastric ulcer the pain is rarely
absent; it is of a dull, gnawing character, is strictly localized in
the centre of the epigastrium, and is aggravated by pressure and by
food.Moreover, the vomited matter often contains blood.In cancer of
the stomach the pain is not as severe and spasmodic in character as in
gastralgia, the vomiting is a more prominent symptom, and the material
vomited has the characteristic cancerous look.Cancer is more apt to
occur too in advanced life, and it is characterized by a steady
progressive emaciation.Gastralgia may also be confounded with rheumatism of the abdominal
muscles as well as neuralgia of the inferior intercostal nerves, and it
is liable to be confounded with colic resulting from biliary calculi.Colicky pains in the transverse portions of the colon may also be
mistaken for pains in the stomach."It is no exaggeration to say," says
Trousseau, "that in perhaps half the cases which are called gastralgia
the affection is nothing more than cholalgia."The more fixed the pain
is to one spot, and the nearer it is to the median line, the greater is
the probability of its being gastric.PROGNOSIS.--Notwithstanding the severe and apparently alarming nature
of the symptoms, the prognosis of gastralgia is in the main favorable,
although the prospect of a permanent and speedy cure is small.The
duration of the disease depends on the nature and persistence of the
exciting causes, and these are so often associated with an exhausted
state of innervation that speedy recovery from the disease cannot be
promised.In the simpler varieties, caused by improper food, the
disease will disappear by removing the cause, and the hysterical forms
are liable to disappear with advancing life.So also cases arising from
malaria, anaemia, chlorosis, uterine disease, rheumatism, and gout may
be relieved by removing the cause.But there are cases produced by
unknown causes, and especially cases associated with a general and
unexplained cachexia, in which the prognosis is not good.TREATMENT.--This is both radical and palliative.The radical treatment
must have reference to the diseases which have given rise to it.If,
for instance, the gastralgia can be traced to sympathetic disturbances
of the uterine organs, no remedy can be permanently effective until the
cause is removed.Since chlorosis and anaemia are so often found
associated with it, benefit may be expected from the ferruginous
preparations in some form.Iron occupies a prominent place as a
remedial agent.The precipitated carbonate is to be preferred on
account of its peculiar influence over the nervous system, and
especially over painful neuralgic conditions.It may be given in drachm
doses, or even larger, combined with ginger or aromatic powder.If the
stomach will not tolerate it, other preparations may be tried.Quinia is a valuable addition to iron, and it is specially valuable in
cases of suspected malarious origin.Sometimes a few large doses will
break up the paroxysmal pains as no other agent will.In the more chronic forms of the disease arsenic is one of the most
reliable remedies we possess.It has a well-deserved reputation in the
treatment of a great variety of nervous affections, and in none more
than in the disease now under consideration.It should be given for a
length of time--three or four minims of Fowler's solution, gradually
increased and {463} given immediately after food--and in cases of
anaemia it should be associated with iron.In irritable, broken-down conditions of the nervous system nux vomica,
or its alkaloid strychnia, is a useful remedy.But it is a powerful
stimulant to the spinal nerve-centre, and care should be used in the
too protracted use of the remedy or in its administration in too large
doses.It may be combined with the phosphate or the valerianate of
zinc, or either may be given separately.The nitrate and oxide of
silver have also been used with asserted success.Nitrate of silver may
be given in pill form with opium.If there is a strong hysterical element, the bromides and
antispasmodics may be tried in connection with remedies calculated to
strengthen the nervous system.The judicious employment in such cases
of hydro-therapeutic measures is of great value.Good results are also
obtained from electricity.Among palliative remedies--_i.e._ remedies that act directly on the
painful gastric nerves--the subnitrate of bismuth has long been
regarded with great favor.Its action is mainly local; it may be given,
therefore, in drachm doses or more three or four times a day.If there
is nothing to contraindicate its use, aconite or dilute hydrocyanic
acid may be given with the bismuth.For the immediate relief of pain, however, there is no substitute for
opium.The subcutaneous injection of morphia will generally give
immediate relief.But there are many reasons why we should try other
palliative remedies.In a disease so painful in character a remedy that
gives such prompt relief is liable to abuse.The formation of the opium
habit should be carefully guarded against.Spirits of chloroform may be
tried, therefore, as a substitute for opium, followed by large draughts
of hot water--hot as the patient can possibly sip it.Hot water of
itself often gives immediate relief.An important part of the treatment consists in well-regulated hygiene.Change of air, travel, pleasant mental surroundings, together with
carefully regulated diet, are in a majority of cases more efficacious
than drugs.Acute Gastritis (Acute Gastric Catarrh).Reasoning from the great functional activity of the stomach, from its
daily periodical change of blood-supply, from its extensive glandular
arrangement, and from its important relations to the functions of
vegetative and animal life, we might readily infer that it would be
frequently the seat of acute and destructive inflammation.But it is
remarkable, all things considered, how seldom that is the case.Indeed,
acute spontaneous inflammation of the stomach is almost unknown.When
it occurs it most frequently results from toxic causes.In less severe
forms, however, not attended with immediate danger to life, it is
undoubtedly a disease of frequent occurrence, and in this more
comprehensive sense the subject will be considered in the present
section.The mucous membrane alone is usually the seat of the disease, and for
this reason it has become the custom of late years to describe it as
gastric {464} catarrh.This may be objectionable, for the reason that
it does not include gastric inflammation of every grade of intensity.The term catarrh is generally applied to much more simple anatomical
structures than those pertaining to the stomach.We shall consider the
subject therefore under two forms--namely, (1) Catarrhal; (2)
Erythematous gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Certain conditions predispose to the disease.Acute
catarrhal gastritis is specially liable to occur in those who
habitually suffer from a disordered stomach.This may arise from
functional disturbance of the digestive process on the one hand, or
mechanical obstruction on the other.Mechanical causes are widespread
in their influence.Thus, weak heart-action from any cause tends to
disturb the normal adjustment between the two sides of the
circulation--arterial and venous.An abnormal amount of blood
accumulates on the venous side of the circulation, and chronic passive
hyperaemia of the abdominal viscera is the result.The effect of this
upon the stomach is to lower its functional activity and to invite
inflammatory action.The same condition results from structural
diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.Persons suffering from valvular
diseases of the heart, emphysema of the lungs, or cirrhosis of the
liver are strongly predisposed to diseases of the stomach.Gastric
troubles are also apt to supervene during the progress of various
diseases.Gouty and rheumatic persons are specially prone to suffer from gastric
catarrh; and eruptive disorders, such as scarlatina, diphtheria, etc.,
tend to erythematous forms of gastric inflammation.Catarrhal gastritis
is also a very common sequence of the whole class of malarious fevers,
including yellow fever, intermittents, and remittents.In its more
acute form gastric inflammation supervenes in the course of yellow
fever; and what is observed here in an extreme degree exists in a minor
degree in all the so-called malarious fevers.Intermittent and
remittent fevers are always attended with gastro-duodenitis and
gastro-hepatitis.The degree of this inflammatory complication
determines the continued character of the fever.Upon this point the
writer has very decided views based upon a wide field of observation in
malarious regions of country.We have lost ground in the treatment of
these diseases by directing our attention almost exclusively to the
febrile and malarious, to the exclusion of the inflammatory, elements.Quinia is inoperative in the cure of these troublesome and often fatal
complications.Indeed, it is more than that: it is often positively
injurious.Arrest the local phlegmasia and secure freedom of abdominal
circulation, and we at once get the action of the specific remedy.It
may be going too far to affirm, as did Broussais, that gastritis
sustains a causative relation to all forms of fever, but that
gastro-duodenitis is an important secondary condition in all forms of
malarious fever, complicating and perpetuating the febrile state, there
can be no doubt; and it is equally clear that it constitutes one of the
most dangerous complications.Excessive alimentation, with the
injudicious use of tonics and stimulants, so often resorted to in the
treatment of these fevers in their early stages, only serves to
intensify the local inflammation.Abolish the congestive and
inflammatory element of a remittent, and it at once becomes an
intermittent.Mention has been made of weak heart-action as a factor in catarrhal
{465} gastritis; also mechanical impediments to the return of blood
from the stomach to the heart.The stomach is thereby kept in a
constant state of congestion, the nutrition of the mucous membrane is
less active than in health, and its solvent juices are more sparingly
secreted.Thus in long-continued congestion produced by mitral disease
of the heart Samuel Fenwick found the formation of pepsin impaired.He
made artificial gastric juice from the mucous membrane of three males
dying of heart disease, and he found, on the average, only 2-9 grs.of
albumen were dissolved, whereas the amount digested by the mucous
membrane of persons who had died of other maladies was 4 grains.In the
cases of three females a still smaller amount of solvent power was
displayed.These facts have important bearings upon the question of
alimentation in fevers and the conditions in which there is chronic
congestion on the venous side of the circulation.Long-continued
passive hyperaemia of the stomach from any cause not only impairs its
functional activity, but strongly predisposes to inflammatory
complication.Acute erythematous gastritis is most frequently met with in children.It is a very common form of disease in early life, and the local nature
of the malady is frequently overlooked.Few questions in practical
medicine are more embarrassing to the physician.It has been known and
described as gastric and remittent fever, as continued typhoid, and
even as acute hydrocephalus.Writers and teachers describe and
dogmatize, while practical men hesitate at the bedside.There is little
doubt but in the background of these febrile manifestations in children
there is often an acute erythematous gastritis, which is more
successfully treated by a rigid milk diet, small doses of calomel and
bismuth, mucilaginous drinks, cooling saline laxatives, and sometimes
leeches applied to the epigastrium, than by the heroic doses of quinia
so frequently resorted to.We must not, in this connection, lose sight of the fact, so clearly
pointed out by Broussais, that inflammation of the stomach is often
secondarily repeated in the brain.The whole field of clinical
observation abounds in illustrations of this.How often, for instance,
we can trace the sick headache, the delirium, and even convulsive
movements of the voluntary muscles, to primary gastro-intestinal
irritation!In the play of the sympathies morbid irritative action is
transmitted from the organic to the cerebro-spinal nerves; and of all
portions of the abdominal viscera the stomach and upper portion of the
intestinal track are the most frequent seat of these intense morbid
sympathies.Remedies which cool the stomach and lessen inflammatory
action diminish the excitement of the brain, and vice versa.EXCITING CAUSES.--Among the direct exciting causes of gastric
inflammation--exclusive of acrid or corrosive poisons--the most
frequent in this country is the excessive use of alcohol.It acts most
injuriously when it is but slightly diluted and taken on an empty
stomach.And next to this pernicious habit, in the order of importance,
is the use of large quantities of food--more than the stomach has
capacity to digest, and more than is necessary for the wants of the
system.Excessive alimentation is a prolific source of gastric
inflammation.It generally manifests itself, however, in a chronic or
subacute form.Acute erythematous gastritis, so frequently met with in children, is
{466} often present in scarlatina.It is evidently not catarrhal in
character, for in the earlier stages there is no increased secretion of
mucus and but little injection of the mucous membrane.The changes are
observed in the deeper structures of the stomach, and principally in
the gastric tubules.They are much distended by granular, fatty, and
albuminous matter; and in this respect it is analogous to erythematous
affections of the skin with which it is associated in scarlatina.Finally, acute gastric catarrh may be excited by all causes that weaken
the digestive power either by weakening the gastric juice or by
retarding the movements of the stomach.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--No disease requires more knowledge and caution
in determining post-mortem changes than those of the stomach.In the
first place, it presents in inflammatory conditions markedly different
degrees of intensity, with corresponding differences in anatomical
changes.Its diseases also present many special forms, and changes take
place after death which simulate morbid processes during life.Moreover, intense vascular injections are apt to disappear in the small
superficial vessels after death.This applies to all mucous membranes,
but specially to the mucous membrane of the stomach, which is the seat
of varying amounts of blood in their physiological limits during life.For this reason the observations of Beaumont made upon a living subject
are invested with peculiar interest.It will be remembered that in the
case of Alexis St.Martin the appearances noted were such as belong to
the milder forms of inflammation.Beaumont noticed in this case, after
indiscretions in eating or abuse of ardent spirits, a livid
erythematous redness of the gastric mucous membrane, with, at the same
time, dryness of the mouth, thirst, accelerated pulse, and, at the
height of the injection, an entire absence of gastric secretion.At
other times there was considerable muco-purulent matter, with oozing of
grumous blood, "resembling the discharge from the bowels in cases of
chronic dysentery."The fluid taken out through the fistulous opening
consisted mostly, however, of mucus and muco-pus which showed an
alkaline reaction.He describes also a condition of ecchymosis and
oozing of blood from certain red spots of the gastric mucous membrane,
and when thus limited the constitutional symptoms experienced by the
patient were correspondingly slight.Ecchymoses may be present in large
number, with exudates of false membrane, which Beaumont describes as
aphthous.Brinton also describes a severe form of gastritis which he
terms ulcerative, in which he observed hemorrhagic erosions.In the catarrhal form of gastritis the mucous membrane is covered with
a thick, tenacious, stringy mucus; it is softer than usual, and
generally thickened.It presents at the same time a dead-white
appearance, corresponding to Virchow's cloudy swelling--a condition
analogous to that which is observed in acute Bright's disease.Even
casts of the tubes are sometimes met with.This inflammatory change in the substance of the mucous membrane is
especially observed in the acute erythematous form of gastritis
complicating scarlatina.In the early stage there is no increased
secretion of mucus, and at a more advanced stage the membrane may be
even paler than usual.In cases of acute toxic gastritis intense redness is seen over the
entire {467} surface of the mucous membrane, followed by rapid
exudations and sloughing of portions of the membrane.In all forms of the disease there is a tendency to extension of the
inflammation into the duodenum and small intestines.In the more
chronic forms we almost invariably encounter the condition of
gastro-duodenitis.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of inflammation of the stomach present wide
differences in their intensity, depending upon the degree of severity
in different cases.In acute inflammation caused by the direct action
of poisonous irritants they are pronounced and highly diagnostic.The
patient immediately complains of burning pain, referred to the
epigastrium, followed by intense thirst and vomiting.The thirst is apt
to be very great and the act of vomiting painful.The vomited matters
contain mucus, saliva, sometimes bile, and not unfrequently, in fatal
cases, black, grumous, coffee-ground material.There is marked
tenderness on pressure, the pulse is frequent and small, coldness of
the surface is marked, and hiccough is apt to occur.The expression of
the patient is anxious, the abdominal muscles rigid, and, in fatal
cases, the prostration becomes rapidly extreme.These symptoms apply to acute cases of marked severity,
usually of toxic origin.In the milder forms of catarrhal gastritis more frequently met with
there is seldom complaint of pain.The sensation is rather that of
fulness, uneasiness, with more or less tenderness on pressure.The
symptoms are such as belong to acute indigestion and the embarras
gastrique of French authors.The phenomena may be those of a slight
bilious attack.The tongue is foul, the breath offensive, the bowels
confined, and the urine high- and scanty.There is also
generally a sense of fatigue, and soon secondary cerebral symptoms
supervene, such as cerebral hyperaemia, headache, vertigo, noises in
the ears, palpitation, sighing, yawning, dyspnoea, faintness, and in
severe cases marked physical and mental depression.Nausea and vomiting
are common, and if the inflammation extends to the duodenum and liver,
symptoms of gastro-hepatic catarrh manifest themselves.If fever
supervenes, urticaria sometimes complicates these attacks.In young children the inflammation is apt to involve a general catarrh
of the whole intestinal track.Thirst is excessive, followed by
vomiting and diarrhoea.The discharges are liquid, watery, offensive,
acid, and out of all proportion to the amount of fluid absorbed by the
stomach.The pulse becomes weak and fluttering, the skin pale, the
features pinched, the eyes sunken, and the extremities cold.The
tendency is toward rapid collapse and fatal issue.The symptoms
describe what is usually known as cholera infantum.It has its analogue
in the cholera morbus of adults.In erythematous gastritis nausea and vomiting are as general as in the
catarrhal form, but, unlike the catarrhal, pain at the epigastrium is a
prominent symptom.In
phthisical cases the sensation is rather that of rawness of the
oesophagus and stomach.Thirst is a troublesome symptom; the tongue is
red or dry and glazed; tenderness of the epigastrium is marked;
diarrhoea is generally present; and, as in the catarrhal form, the
stools are fetid and unhealthy.The disease shows a marked tendency to
become chronic.{468} DIAGNOSIS.--In the more acute forms of the disease the symptoms
are all highly diagnostic.Vomiting, burning pain of the stomach,
tenderness on pressure, intense thirst, with frequent and small pulse,
point with almost unerring certainty to acute gastric inflammation.But
vomiting of itself, however persistent, is not evidence of gastritis,
for it may be present from many other causes.If the vomiting be
attended by headache, it may be confounded with gastric irritability
from brain disease.Thus, chronic meningitis with persistent vomiting
strongly simulates gastritis, and in the case of children it is liable
to be mistaken for it.In gastritis the nausea is from the first a
pronounced feature of the disease.Vomiting in affections of the brain
is often unattended by nausea.In gastritis the tongue is more
frequently coated or red and glazed.Diarrhoea is also more frequently
present, especially in early life.In affections of the brain the
tongue may be clean and the bowels are usually obstinately confined.When there is much fever, gastritis may be confounded with remittent or
typhoid fever.In periods of childhood this mistake is specially liable
to occur, for there are many symptoms in common.In all such cases the
early history of the case ought to be carefully inquired into.In
gastritis we may be able to detect the cause in any particular case.The gastric symptoms are apt to occur suddenly, and, as already stated,
are prominent from the first.In meningitis the skin is more frequently
dry; in gastric catarrh perspirations are common.The more prominent
and characteristic symptoms of typhoid should also be carefully
excluded, such as the gradual invasion, peculiar eruption, bronchial
catarrh, enlargement of the spleen, gurgling in the right iliac fossae,
with tympanitic abdomen.Peritonitis, with vomiting, may be mistaken
for gastritis, but the diffuse tenderness, the fixedness of position,
the rigidity of the abdominal muscles, and the tympanitic distension
serve to guide us in our diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis must have reference to the cause.The more
violent forms of the disease resulting from corrosive poisons are
generally fatal.Death is apt to take place in a few hours from a
condition of collapse.The immediate cause of death is failure of
heart-action.It is also a dangerous disease in the extremes of life.In its acute form in children it is apt to terminate fatally,
especially if it is not recognized early and judiciously treated.The
complications of the disease may also render the prognosis unfavorable.TREATMENT.--The most important indication of treatment, applicable to
all forms of gastric inflammation, is to secure complete or partial
rest for the inflamed organ.In dangerous cases no food should be taken
into the stomach.The patient should be nourished exclusively by
nutrient enemata.If food is permitted, it should be restricted to milk
and lime-water, administered in small quantities at short intervals.In
acute and dangerous cases, suddenly manifesting themselves, the
exciting cause should be carefully inquired into, and speedily removed,
if possible, by an emetic, or, if need be, by the stomach-pump, if the
poison be one which can be ejected; and following this antidotes are to
be administered according to the nature of the poison.To allay the intense thirst small pieces of ice should be swallowed at
frequent intervals, or, what is often more grateful to the patient,
iced {469} effervescing drinks in small doses oft repeated.Injections
of water may also tend to relieve thirst.To allay vomiting the
physician is often tempted to try a great variety of remedies which are
usually worse than useless, for they aggravate rather than relieve the
distressing symptom.For the purpose of quieting the stomach opium is
the most reliable remedy we possess.It is best administered
hypodermically.Fomentations may be applied over the epigastrium.Stimulants are, of course, contraindicated on account of their
irritating action on the inflamed membrane, but in case of rapid
tendency to death by failure of heart-action they should be
administered by the rectum or hypodermically.In milder cases--which are much the more common--physiological rest of
the organ is also a cardinal principle of treatment.In cases of any severity the patient should be
kept quiet in bed.For the condition of acute indigestion known as
embarras gastrique ipecacuanha in six- or eight-grain doses, given
three times within twenty-four hours, will often produce healthy
bilious stools, and in this manner accomplish the cure.One or two
grains of calomel may be added to each dose of ipecacuanha with
benefit.In all forms of catarrhal gastritis, especially if symptoms of
portal congestion are present, mild mercurial cathartics are attended
with benefit.Six or eight grains of calomel may be rubbed up with
sugar of milk and placed dry on the tongue, followed by a cooling
saline aperient.When diarrhoea is present in such cases, it should be
regarded as conservative, and encouraged by the administration of
half-grain or grain doses of calomel, combined with bismuth and
bicarbonate of soda.The diet should be restricted to milk and
lime-water or milk mixed with Vichy or Seltzer water.Demulcent drinks
should be freely given.In the slighter attacks effervescing drinks are
grateful to the patient; and if there be excessive formation of acid in
the stomach, antacids and sedatives should be administered.Bismuth has a peculiar sedative and antiseptic effect in the milder
forms of inflammatory action of mucous membranes.It is especially
valuable in gastro-intestinal troubles of children.Its action is
mainly local surface action, and may therefore be given in liberal
doses if necessary.Children may take from five to ten grains, and
adults twenty grains or more.Hydrocyanic acid adds to its sedative
qualities, or when pain is present, with diarrhoea, opium in some form
may be added.The salicylate of bismuth is specially indicated when we
want to add to the antiseptic qualities of bismuth.The general principles of treatment indicated here are applicable to
the so-called remittent fevers of children--namely, calomel in small
doses, combined with bismuth and bicarbonate of soda, followed by
occasional cool saline laxatives.Ipecacuanha is also a valuable agent
in correcting morbid gastro-intestinal secretions.When there is early
epigastric tenderness, with hot skin and elevation of temperature, two
or three leeches should be applied to the epigastrium, followed by warm
poultices of linseed meal.Dry cupping may also be used with benefit;
and if decided remissions occur, with suspicions of a complicating
malarious element, a few liberal doses of quinia may be tried.In many
such cases, however, it will be found unnecessary, and not unfrequently
hurtful.In acute gastro-intestinal inflammations of children--the
{470} temperature reaching 105 degrees or more--no febrifuge, in the
opinion of the writer, is equal to the cool or cold bath, repeated from
time to time until there is a decided reduction of temperature.But the
gastric inflammation, rather than the fever, should mainly claim our
attention.Great care is necessary during convalescence from acute gastric
disease, particularly as regards the hygienic management.The apparent
debility of the patient too often tempts the physician to the early and
injudicious use of tonics, stimulants, and excessive alimentation,
which, if persisted in, can scarcely fail to perpetuate a chronic form
of inflammatory action.Chronic Gastritis (Chronic Gastric Catarrh).There is perhaps no malady more frequently met with than chronic
gastric catarrh, and none more frequently misunderstood.It comprises
many different forms of gastric derangement, which are grouped under
the general head of inflammatory dyspepsia, with many symptoms strongly
simulating ordinary functional dyspepsia.It includes, in the author's
opinion, a large number of cases of obstinate chronic dyspepsia, which
are badly managed because not recognized as of inflammatory origin.ETIOLOGY.--In a more or less chronic form it is frequently met with as
a result of the acute affections.Hence the etiology is mainly that of
acute gastric catarrh.By mechanical causes which interfere with the portal circulation.In connection with certain constitutional states, such as gout,
rheumatism, phthisis, renal disease, certain eruptive diseases, and as
a sequence of malarious fevers.By the excessive use of alcohol and other gastric irritants.By errors of diet, especially excessive alimentation.By decomposition of ingested aliment owing to deficiency of gastric
juice.By all causes that weaken the digestive power and lower the general
tone of the system.Of all these causes, errors of diet are most apt to produce it, and to
perpetuate it when once established.And next to this, in the order of
importance, is the immoderate use of alcohol, especially by persons
whose general health and digestive power are below a healthy standard.Such persons are apt to suffer from irritative and inflammatory forms
of dyspepsia, which, in various degrees of intensity, alternate with
the acuter forms of embarras gastrique.The injudicious use of drugs may also be mentioned.There can be no
doubt that many transient and functional forms of indigestion merge
into the more chronic inflammatory forms of dyspepsia from the abuse of
stimulants, tonics, and purgatives.Anxious for relief, and urged on by
hope of recovery, the victims of functional dyspepsia are apt to have
recourse to every grade of quacks and to be subjected to every form of
harassing and mischievous treatment.Indeed, the use of potential and
irritating drugs, administered for all kinds of ailments, real or
imaginary, enters largely into the etiology of chronic gastric catarrh.These are mainly
{471} such as offer impediment to the return of blood from the stomach
to the heart.In acute cases the congestion may be very intense.Congestion of the same kind, but more gradual in its occurrence and
less in degree, may be present from all conditions affecting the
circulation of venous blood through the liver.General anaemia, by
producing weak heart-action, disturbs the normal adjustment between the
arterial and venous sides of the circulation.Blood accumulates in the
veins and capillaries, and morbid action propagates itself in a
direction contrary to the circulation.Hence in all conditions of
general anaemia there is tendency to dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema,
bronchorrhoea, special forms of liver disease, gastric catarrh, and
even temporary albuminuria.All mechanical obstructions to the free
transit of blood through the heart, lungs, or liver are followed by the
same results.A free secretion of mucus into the stomach is one of the
most commonly recognized.This
alkaline mucus, while it dilutes the digestive juices of the stomach,
furnishes favorable conditions for the development of low
micro-organisms, which contribute to the fermentative process.We may
not duly estimate the effects of these organisms on a mucous membrane
softened by long-continued passive hyperaemia.Malarious fevers, from their congestive tendency, give rise to the more
acute forms of gastro-enteric inflammation.In the more chronic forms
of intermittent and remittent fevers more or less gastric inflammation
is invariably present.Indeed, in all forms of fever gastric
inflammation is a complicating element, and the recognition of the fact
has an important bearing on the treatment.Certain constitutional diseases appear to involve special liability to
this affection, such as scrofula, phthisis, gout, rheumatism, syphilis,
and many chronic forms of skin disease; and in many cases the cause is
not apparent.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--The gross appearance of the stomach in chronic
gastritis is thus admirably described by Broussais, who faithfully
recorded what he "observed during many years in the bodies of those who
have long suffered from distaste for food, nausea, and vomiting."These
observations were made long before morbid anatomy had thrown much light
on the more minute structural changes of organs, and the general
picture will be recognized as faithful to-day: "Softening, friability,
and the reduction into a kind of gelatinous mass commonly occurs in the
region of the lower part of the larger curvature of the stomach; and
when closely examined it is perceived that it is not only the mucous
membrane that has undergone that species of decomposition, but that the
muscular has participated in it, and that the whole of the cellular
tissue which united the three membranes has entirely disappeared.The
parietes of the viscus are then reduced to a very thin lamina of serous
membrane, commonly so fragile as to tear on the slightest handling, or
even already perforated without any effort on the part of the
anatomist.The pyloric region, on the contrary, has manifestly acquired
more consistence and thickness; the mucous membrane there presents
large folds, the muscular appears more developed, and the cellular and
vascular are injected; sometimes even a true scirrhous state is
observed there.The portion of the mucous membrane which covers this
scirrhus is sometimes {472} ulcerated, but that in the surrounding
parts and at the border of the ulcer, far from being softened, is, on
the contrary, tumefied, indurated, and injected.Finally, though there
may or may not be ulceration of the pylorus, it is always manifestly
hypertrophied, whilst the lower part of the great curvature is the seat
of softening and atrophy."These were the observations of the great anatomist apparent to the
naked eye.At the present time we can only confirm them by stating that
structural changes are particularly noticed in the pyloric region of
the stomach.The mucous membrane generally is vascular and covered with
a grayish, tough, transparent mucus.It is more opaque and thicker than
natural.The surface is usually changed in color: it may be red, brown,
ash-gray, slate-, or even black in spots.The darkened spots are
due to pigmented matter, and this is generally most marked in the
pyloric half of the stomach.It is most commonly met with in cases of
prolonged passive congestion of the stomach from portal obstruction,
and requires for its production the rupture of capillaries in the
superficial layers of the membrane and the transformation of the
haematin into pigment.The same condition often produces ecchymoses and
hemorrhagic erosions in spots.In other cases the mucous membrane is
strikingly uneven, being studded with numerous little prominences
separated from each other by shallow depressions or furrows.This
condition, which has been compared to granulations upon wounds, is
called mammillation.It is the etat mamelonne of Louis, and is
considered by him as a sure and constant sign of inflammatory action.Like many other structural changes, it is usually found in the
neighborhood of the pylorus.More rarely polypoid growths project from
the membrane, and little cysts also frequently appear in the mucous
membrane.Chronic inflammation tends to thickening of the mucous membrane.It
sometimes is not only greatly thickened, but acquires an extreme degree
of toughness.Exceptionally, however, the membrane, either entire or in
spots, may be abnormally thin.The thickening of the walls of the
stomach, when it involves the pylorus, gives rise to constriction of
the orifice and consequent dilatation of the stomach.When the disease has been of long standing the interstitial tissue
between the tubules becomes thickened, the stomach is changed in its
normal structure, and the tubules themselves become confused,
compressed, and much less straight and parallel than in the normal
state.Or they may in some cases be enlarged, according to Flint, in
consequence of swelling and parenchymatous or fatty degeneration of
their epithelial cells.Microscopic examination often shows changes
such as occur in other glandular organs.The glands and tubules become
the seat of degenerative changes, such as are observed in Bright's
disease of the kidney, and they are frequently found associated in the
same case.The mouths of the gastric tubules become blocked up, while
deeper parts are dilated into cysts; and at times they are atrophied or
filled with granular fatty matter.Many cases of persistent anaemia may be traced, according to Flint, to
this degenerative process of the gastric tubules.The SYMPTOMS of chronic gastritis are mainly those of difficult
digestion of an aggravated kind, and are liable to be mistaken for
those of {473} ordinary functional dyspepsia.Some points of
distinction were referred to in the section treating of functional
dyspepsia; and while there are many symptoms in common, it is vastly
important that the two forms of the disease should be early recognized,
for they are radically distinct in their pathology and treatment.We now speak of what is usually known as inflammatory, irritative, or
gastric dyspepsia--a persistent and aggravated form of indigestion
which has its origin in the stomach itself, in contradistinction to
dyspepsia which originates largely from causes outside of the stomach
and transmitted to it through nervous impression.The one is functional
and indirect; the other is inflammatory and direct.The symptoms referable directly to the stomach are mainly those of
difficult and painful digestion, and are alike characteristic of all
forms of indigestion, such as loss of appetite, sense of weight and
fulness of the epigastrium, distress after taking food, acidity,
eructations of gas, etc.But chronic gastritis is more frequently
accompanied by a burning sensation in the epigastric region,
accompanied by tenderness on pressure, which is generally increased
after meals.Sometimes this tenderness amounts to actual pain, which is
increased after meals.But we are liable to be misled by pain: gastric
pain is not a characteristic symptom; subacute forms of the disease may
exist without any fixed pain; the sensation is rather that of burning,
uneasiness, and oppression of the epigastric region.The appetite, as a
rule, is greatly impaired--indeed, the sense of hunger is rarely
experienced--and nausea and vomiting frequently follow the ingestion of
food.This is especially the case when catarrh of the stomach is
associated with renal disease, portal congestion, or chronic
alcoholism.Large quantities of mucus are brought up, the vomiting
taking place usually in the morning, and on examination of the mucus it
will frequently be found to contain sarcinae and large numbers of
bacterial organisms.When stricture of the pylorus is present the
vomiting of putrid, half-digested food usually takes place about the
termination of the digestive process.The tongue presents characteristics peculiar to chronic inflammation of
the stomach.In some cases it is small and red, with enlarged and red
papillae; in others, it is broad and flabby and somewhat pale; but in
either case, on close inspection, the papillae will be found red and
enlarged, this being more apparent on the tip and edges.In children of
scrofulous habits and in older persons of tubercular tendency the whole
organ is redder than natural, the papillae standing out as vivid red
spots.In other cases the catarrh of the stomach extends to the mucous
membrane of the mouth.In all cases of oral catarrh the tongue, instead
of being red and pointed, is large and apparently oedematous.It is
uniformly covered with a white or dirty brownish coat, and frequently
shows the impression of the teeth upon its edges.The secretions of the
mouth are depraved, the breath heavy and offensive, and the gums spongy
and unhealthy in appearance.It is rarely absent either in the acute or
chronic form of the disease.It is most marked in the intervals between
meals and in the evenings.It is rare in gastric catarrh of long standing that it does not extend
to the intestines, and occasionally from the duodenum to the ductus
{474} choledochus; in which case we have the combined symptoms of
gastro-intestinal catarrh associated with jaundice.The nutritive
system becomes implicated, and patients are especially prone to develop
any diathesis to which they may be liable.There remains a group of symptoms of great interest in the study of
gastric inflammation--important because liable to mislead as to the
real nature of the difficulty--namely, morbid conditions of the nervous
system.Few diseases have such a wide range of morbid sympathies, and
few, it may be added, are so generally misunderstood and
misinterpreted.Two main facts, as formulated by Broussais, deserve to
be restudied by the profession:

First, that irritations of the visceral parenchyma which do not
implicate their serous membranes only give rise to ill-defined
sensations, and they not painful;

Second, that most of the acute pains arising from visceral irritation
are rather referred to external parts than to the viscera themselves.Unless the seat of very acute inflammation, mucous membranes are
remarkably free from pain, and yet the gastric mucous membrane is the
seat of a most exquisite internal visceral sense and has a wide range
of morbid sympathetic disturbances.These sympathetic phenomena are
often treated for primary neuralgias.No fact in the clinical study of
disease deserves more careful consideration than this.Absence of pain,
then, is calculated to mislead.It is often only the sensation of
uneasiness, depression and melancholy, want of appetite, thirst,
nausea, loathing of food, and derangement of the bilious and gastric
secretions, that directs our attention to the stomach.Moreover, in
gastro-enteric inflammations pain is more frequently felt in parts
sympathetically affected than in the stomach itself."It is only when
irritations of mucous membranes are in the vicinity of the openings of
cavities that the irritations are distinctly perceptible in the seat
they occupy" (Broussais).Morbid irritative action commencing in the
stomach repeats itself in the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, and the
secondary irritation may develop a more immediately dangerous
inflammation than the primary.This is frequently observed in children,
who are specially prone to irritation of the visceral apparatus.Many
cases of primary gastric irritation terminate in acute cerebral
inflammation.Indeed, the greater number of phlegmasiae of the brain
are only sympathetic irritations issuing from primary inflammation of
the stomach.Short of inflammation, the transmitted irritation may
merely give rise to reflex convulsions, and in adults to sick headache,
or, if long continued, to conditions of hypochondria.Headache is a
prominent symptom of gastric irritation.It is not usually acute, but
rather a sense of fulness and pressure, sometimes felt in the frontal,
at other times in the occipital, region.Many cases commonly called
cerebral hyperaemia and cerebral anaemia are nothing more than
malassimilation from chronic gastric catarrh.This fact deserves to be
specially emphasized at present, for we are apt to consider the
cerebral the primary lesion.Vertigo, as in functional dyspepsia, is
also an occasional symptom, and very commonly patients complain of
extreme degrees of sleeplessness and disturbed dreams and nightmare.The heart's action is often disturbed in its rhythm, and sympathetic
dyspnoea leads to suspicion of disease of the lungs.And to all these
{475} nervous phenomena may be added unusual languor, lassitude,
irritability of temper, and a feeling of inability for either mental or
physical exertion.But in the play of morbid sympathies it must be borne in mind that the
stomach may be secondarily affected.Irritations of all organs are
constantly transmitted to the stomach from their very commencement.Hence the frequent loss of appetite, the thirst, the embarrassed
digestion, the deranged gastric secretion, and the altered color of the
tongue.This is markedly the case in all the malarious and essential
forms of fever.Gastric complication in these fevers is rarely, if
ever, absent, and if aggravated by the too early use of tonics and
stimulants and by harsh irritating cathartics, it becomes too often a
fatal complication.Gastric symptoms are also associated with other constitutional
disorders, such as phthisis, renal disease, rheumatism, gout, and
almost all forms of chronic eruptive diseases.Constipation is often obstinate,
and especially is this the case if the catarrhal condition is confined
to the duodenum.The lower down the inflammation the greater the
probability of diarrhoea, and when present the stools are offensive and
frothy; sometimes they are dry and scybalous and coated with a tough,
tenacious mucus which may form casts of portions of the intestinal
track.In other cases patients suffer from distressing intestinal
flatulence and a sense of general discomfort.Piles is a complication
frequently present without reference to complication of the liver.The urine is more frequently disordered than in any other form of
disturbance of digestion.The most common changes consist in an
abundant deposit of the urates; exceptionally, however--especially in
cases of long standing in which there are marked nervous symptoms
associated with defective secretion of the liver and pancreas--it may
be of low specific gravity and pale in color from the presence of
phosphates.Slight febrile movement is not uncommon.Finally, in all cases of chronic gastric catarrh the nutritive system
becomes deeply implicated--much more so than in functional disturbances
of the stomach.Emaciation is almost constantly present, the patient
often showing signs of premature decay.DIAGNOSIS.--The disease with which chronic gastritis is most liable to
be confounded is atonic dyspepsia, the chief points of distinction from
which have been already alluded to.In general terms it may be said
that in chronic gastritis there is more epigastric tenderness, more
burning sensation and feeling of heat in the stomach, more thirst, more
nausea, more persistent loss of appetite, more steady and progressive
loss of flesh, more acidity, more eructations of gas, more general
appearance of premature decay, and greater tendency to hypochondriasis.And yet all these symptoms, in varying degrees of prominence, may be
present in all forms of indigestion.To the points of distinction
already mentioned, then, a few circumstances may be added which will
afford considerable assistance in coming to a correct diagnosis:

1.The length of time the disease has uninterruptedly lasted.The local symptoms are never entirely absent, as is not infrequently
the case in functional dyspepsia.The uneasy sensations, nausea, oppression, or pain, as the
case may be, follow the ingestion of food.They are not so prominently
present when the stomach is empty.In chronic gastritis it will be found that
all the local symptoms are exasperated by the usual treatment of
functional dyspepsia.Stimulants and stimulating food are not well borne.Alcohol,
especially on an empty stomach, produces gastric distress.There is
also frequently slight febrile disturbance.Chronic gastritis, with nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, general pallor,
and loss of flesh, may be mistaken for cancer of the stomach.But in
cancer vomiting is about as apt to take place when the stomach is empty
as during the ingestion of food; pain is usually greater, especially
when the orifices of the stomach are involved; the tenderness is more
marked; the emaciation and pallor more steadily progressive; the
vomiting of coffee-ground material takes place more frequently; and the
disease is more rapid in its progress.The age and sex of the patient
may also aid us in our diagnosis.Cancer is more frequently a disease
of middle and advanced life, and localizes itself oftener in the
stomach of males than females.Finally, the discovery of a tumor would
remove all doubts.Haematemesis in chronic catarrh of the stomach is
almost invariably associated with obstruction to venous circulation in
the liver, heart, or lungs.In rare cases it may be difficult to distinguish chronic gastric
catarrh from ulcer of the stomach.In ulcer of the stomach pain is a
more prominent and constant symptom; it is more centrally located; the
vomiting after taking food is more immediate and persistent; the tongue
may be clean; flatulence is not a constant symptom; the appetite is
seldom much affected; the bowels are generally confined; and there is
nothing characteristic about the urine.TREATMENT.--In this, as in the more acute forms of the disease, rest of
the stomach is important.From mistaken notions of disease we are prone
to over-feed our patients, and thus seriously impair the digestive and
assimilative processes.In chronic inflammation of the stomach a
restricted diet is of prime importance.The physician should most
carefully select the patient's food, and urgently insist on its
exclusive use.This of itself, if faithfully persevered in, will often
effect a cure.The exclusive use of a milk diet--especially skim-milk--should be
thoroughly tested.In testing it we should allow two or three weeks to
elapse before any other food is taken.At the end of that time
soft-boiled eggs, stale bread, and well-cooked rice may be added, with
an occasional chop once a day.Some patients do not tolerate raw milk
well.In such cases we should thoroughly test the peptonized or
pancreatized milk or the peptonized milk-gruel, as suggested by
Roberts.This artificially-digested milk agrees wonderfully well with
many stomachs that cannot digest plain milk.Milk, in whatever form
administered, should be given at comparatively short intervals of time,
and never in quantity beyond the digestive capacity.Better err on the
side of under- than over-feeding.Nothing should be left to the fancy
or caprice of the patient.The food should be carefully selected by the
medical adviser, and given in definite quantities at definite times.Even the moral {477} effect of such discipline is healthful for the
patient.After testing milk diet for a time, we may gradually add small
quantities of rare and thoroughly minced meat.Milk, eggs, and rare
meat are more easily digested, as a rule, than starchy substances.Farinaceous food is apt to give rise to excessive acidity.But stale
bread may be added to the milk, and, if there is tendency to acidity,
better have it toasted thoroughly brown.In addition to the dietetic treatment of the disease, diluents,
timeously administered, are of essential service.As a rule, patients
are too much restricted from their use, under the supposition that they
dilute the gastric juice and thereby impair the digestive power.This
restriction is proper at, and for some time after, the ingestion of
food.But at the end of the first hour after taking food several ounces
of gum-water, or some mucilaginous fluid sweetened and rendered
palatable by a few drops of dilute muriatic acid, should be
administered, and repeated every hour during the digestive process.Diluents, thus administered, are not only grateful in allaying the
thirst of the patient, but are at the same time an essential part of
the treatment.The free use of demulcents at the termination of
digestion in the stomach is especially useful.Beyond these general principles of treatment, applicable to all
varieties of gastric catarrh, we must have reference to the varied
etiology of the disease.This, we have seen, is most complicated.Hence
the difficulty in prescribing any rules of treatment applicable to all
cases.We should seek here, as in all cases, to generalize the disease
and individualize our patient.Chief among remedial agents may be mentioned the alkaline carbonates.When combined with purgative salines they are specially valuable in
gastro-duodenal catarrhs associated with disease of the liver.These
are a very numerous class of cases, especially in malarious regions of
country, and when present in a chronic form lay the foundation of
widespread disorders of nutrition.No treatment in such cases is
effective until we diminish engorgements of the liver and spleen, and
nothing accomplishes this so well as the use of alkaline saline
laxatives.These may be assisted in their action by small doses of
mercurials.It was a cardinal principle among the older practitioners,
in the absence of more minute means of diagnosis, to look well to the
secretions; and what was their strength is, I fear, our weakness.Wonderful results often follow a course of the Carlsbad, Pullna, or
Marienbad waters, taken on an empty stomach, fasting, in the morning.While taking the waters a rigid and restricted diet is enforced.This
is an important part of the treatment.And the fact that so many varied
ailments are cured by a course of these mineral waters with enforced
dietetic regulations only shows the prevalence of gastro-duodenal
catarrhs and their relation to a great variety of human ailments.To a
certain extent the potassio-tartrate of sodium and other saline
laxatives may take the place of these waters if perseveringly used and
taken in the same way.In feebler subjects minute doses of strychnia or
some of the simple vegetable bitters may be used in conjunction with
the laxative salines.In chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastric mucous membrane,
which frequently follow acute attacks, the protracted use of hot water
is often followed by excellent results.There can be no doubt of the
value {478} of hot water in subacute inflammation of mucous membranes
in any locality; and it is specially valuable in gastro-intestinal
catarrh associated with lithaemia.Hot water, laxative salines,
combined with restricted diet and healthful regimen, accomplish much in
correcting morbid conditions of primary assimilation; and by
accomplishing this many secondary ailments promptly disappear.A pint
of water, hot as the patient can drink it, should be taken on an empty
stomach on first rising in the morning, and it may be repeated again an
hour before each meal and at bedtime.A few grains of the bicarbonate
of sodium and a little table-salt may be added.In some cases three or
four drops of tincture of nux vomica or some of the simple bitters may
be taken at the same time with benefit.Alkaline bitters are natural to
the upper portion of the digestive track.No food should be taken for a
half hour or an hour after the hot water.This treatment, to be
effective, must be persevered in for a length of time.A most rigid
system of dietetics suited to individual cases should be enforced at
the same time.In irritable and morbidly sensitive conditions of the mucous membrane
the sedative plan of treatment is not unfrequently followed by good
results; and of remedies belonging to this class bismuth is the most
effective.It is specially indicated in the more irritable forms of
gastric disturbance in which there is a sense of uneasiness and pain at
the epigastrium after taking food.If there is much acidity present, it
may be combined with magnesia or a few grains of finely-pulverized
animal charcoal.Chronic cases of long-continued inflammatory action, with intestinal
complication, are often much benefited by the use of mercurials in
small doses.The one-fifth of a grain of calomel, combined with bismuth
or the bicarbonate of sodium, may be given for weeks without danger of
salivation.In small
doses calomel is undoubtedly sedative to the mucous membrane of the
upper portion of the digestive track.In cases of long standing that
have resisted other modes of treatment the more direct astringents have
been found of great value.Of these, nitrate of silver is to be
preferred, alike for its sedative, astringent, and alterative
properties.It may be given in pill form in from one-quarter to
one-grain doses, combined with opium, a half hour before each meal.The
writer of this article can speak from much experience of the value of
this drug.It proves in many cases a valuable addition to the hot-water
and dietetic course already alluded to.If large quantities of mucus are vomited from time to time, especially
in the morning, we may resort with benefit to the use of other
astringents, such as bismuth, oxalate of cerium, kino, and opium; and
if we have reason to suspect stricture of the pylorus in connection
with a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane, the stomach-pump
gives the patient great relief.It should be used about three hours
after a meal, injecting tepid water, and then reversing the syringe
until the water comes out perfectly clear.Niemeyer speaks highly of it
in such cases.He says: "Even the first application of the pump
generally gives the patients such relief that, so far from dreading a
repetition of this by no means pleasant operation, they clamorously beg
for it."The gastric catarrh of phthisis is difficult to relieve.Artificial
digestives may be tried, with dilute muriatic acid, as already
indicated; and {479} for the relief of pain and irritation there is no
remedy so efficacious as hydrocyanic acid, which may be combined with
bismuth and opium in case there is diarrhoea.Hot water may be also
tried, with restricted animal food.Habitual constipation must be overcome by suitable laxatives and by
enemata.Castor oil is mild and efficient in these cases, or in cases
of unusual torpor of the muscular coat of the bowels small doses of
aloes and strychnia may be tried.The free use of diluents toward the
close of digestion favors free action of the bowels.All harsh and
irritating cathartics are to be carefully avoided.When there is much tenderness of the epigastrium, benefit may be
derived from counter-irritation, and nothing is so effectual as the
repeated application of small blisters.General hygienic measures are in all cases to be insisted upon.In
morbid conditions of the liver and the upper portion of the digestive
track the free supply of oxygen to the lungs is a remedy of much power.Hence patients should live as much as possible in the open air.They
should be warmly clad, and, if not too feeble, frequent cold baths
should be resorted to.After local irritation has been subdued by appropriate treatment,
tonics may be tried to counteract the enfeebled state of the stomach.They are such as are appropriate for functional diseases of the
stomach.But they should be used with caution and judgment in irritable
and inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.If we attempt to force an appetite
by their use, and to crowd upon the stomach more food than it has
capacity to digest, we may intensify the trouble and thereby add to the
patient's general debility.Food and tonics fail to impart strength
because the stomach is not in a condition to digest them.One thing should be mentioned, in conclusion, as an important item in
the treatment--namely, patience.Chronic gastric catarrh, it should be
remembered, is essentially a chronic disease, and time becomes an
important element in its cure.{480}

SIMPLE ULCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Simple ulcer of the stomach is usually round or oval.When
of recent formation it has smooth, clean-cut, or rounded borders,
without evidence of acute inflammation in its floor or in its borders.When of long duration it usually has thickened and indurated margins.The formation of the ulcer is usually attributed, in part at least, to
a disturbance in nutrition and to a subsequent solution by the gastric
juice of a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach.The ulcer may
be latent in its course, but it is generally characterized by one or
more of the following symptoms: pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, hemorrhage
from the stomach, and loss of flesh and strength.It ends frequently in
recovery, but it may end in death by perforation of the stomach, by
hemorrhage, or by gradual exhaustion.SYNONYMS.--The following epithets have been employed to designate this
form of ulcer: simple, chronic, round, perforating, corrosive,
digestive, peptic; ulcus ventriculi simplex, s. chronicum, s. rotundum,
s. perforans, s. corrosivum, s. ex digestione, s. pepticum.HISTORY.--It is only since the description of gastric ulcer by
Cruveilhier in the year 1830 that especial attention has been paid to
this disease.In the writings of the ancients only vague and doubtful references to
ulcer of the stomach are found (Galen, Celsus).It is probable that
cases of this disease were described under such names as passio
cardiaca, gastrodynia, haematemesis, and melaena.After the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century, as post-mortem
examination of human bodies was made with greater frequency, the
existence of ulcers and of cicatrices in the stomach could not escape
attention.But only isolated and curious observations of gastric ulcer
are recorded up to near the end of the eighteenth century.One of the
earliest recorded unmistakable cases of perforating ulcer was observed
by John Bauhin, and is described in the _Sepulchretum_ of Bonetus,
published in 1679.Other cases belonging to this period were described
by Donatus, Courtial, Littre, Schenck, and Margagni.[1]

[Footnote 1: References to these and to other cases may be found in
Lebert's _Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878, p.180 _et seq._]

To Matthew Baillie unquestionably belongs the credit of having first
accurately described, in 1793, the anatomical peculiarities of simple
gastric ulcer.[2] At a later date he published three good engravings of
{481} this disease.[3] Baillie's concise and admirable description of
the morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer was unaccompanied by clinical data,
and seems to have had little or no influence in directing increased
attention to this disease.[Footnote 2: _The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of
the Human Body_, London, 1793, p.[Footnote 3: _A Series of Engravings, accompanied with Explanations,
etc._, London, 1799.]A valuable account of the symptoms of gastric ulcer was given by John
Abercrombie in 1824.[4] Nearly all of the symptoms now recognized as
belonging to this affection may be found in his article.He knew the
latent causes of the disease, the great diversity of symptoms in
different cases, and the modes of death by hemorrhage, by perforation,
and by asthenia.He regarded ulcer simply as a localized chronic
inflammation of the stomach, and did not distinguish carefully between
simple and cancerous ulceration.[Footnote 4: "Contributions to the Pathology of the Stomach, the
Pancreas, and the Spleen," _Edinburgh Med.See also, by the same author, _Pathological and
Practical Researches on Diseases of the Stomach, etc._--an excellent
work which passed through several editions.]Cruveilhier,[5] in the first volume of his great work on _Pathological
Anatomy_, published between the years 1829 and 1835, for the first time
clearly distinguished ulcer of the stomach from cancer of the stomach
and from ordinary gastritis.He gave an authoritative and full
description of gastric ulcer from the anatomical, the clinical, and the
therapeutical points of view.[Footnote 5: J. Cruveilhier, _Anatomie pathologique du Corps humain_,
tome i., Paris, 1829-35, livr.; and tome ii., Paris,
1835-42, livr.Next to Cruveilhier, Rokitansky has had the greatest influence upon the
modern conception of gastric ulcer.In 1839 this pathologist gave a
description of the disease based upon an analysis of 79 cases.[6] The
anatomical part of his description has served as the model for all
subsequent writers upon this subject.[Footnote 6: Rokitansky, _Oesterreich.Jahrb._, 1839, Bd.(abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.Since the ushering in by Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky of the modern
era in the history of gastric ulcer, medical literature abounds in
articles upon this disease.But it cannot be said that the importance
of these works is at all commensurate with their number or that they
have added very materially to the classical descriptions given by
Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky.Perhaps most worthy of mention of the
works of this later era are the article by Jaksch relating to
symptomatology and diagnosis, that of Virchow pertaining to etiology,
the statistical analyses by Brinton, and the contributions to the
treatment of the disease by Ziemssen and by Leube.[7] In 1860, Ludwig
Muller published an extensive monograph upon gastric ulcer.[8]

frequency of simple gastric ulcer.The method usually adopted is to
observe the number of cases in which open ulcers and cicatrices are
found {482} in the stomach in a large number of autopsies.But this
method is open to two objections.The first objection is, that scars in
the stomach, particularly if they are small, are liable to be
overlooked or not to be noted in the record of the autopsy unless
special attention is directed to their search.The second objection is,
that it is not proven that all of the cicatrices found in the stomach
are the scars of healed simple ulcers, and that, in fact, it is
probable that many are not.In consequence of these defects (and others
might be mentioned) this method is of very limited value, although it
is perhaps the best which we have at our disposal.In 32,052 autopsies made in Prague, Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, and
Kiel,[9] there were found 1522 cases of open ulcer or of cicatrix in
the stomach.If all the scars be reckoned as healed ulcers, according
to these statistics gastric ulcer, either cicatrized or open, is found
in about 5 per cent.[Footnote 9: The Prague statistics embrace 11,888 autopsies, compiled
from the following sources: 1, Jaksch, _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; 2, Dittrich, _ibid._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x., xii., xiv.; 3,
Willigk, _ibid._, vol.; 4, Eppinger, _ibid._, vol.The Berlin statistics are to be found in dissertations by Plange
(abstract in _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.), by Steiner, and by
Wollmann (abstracts in _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1868), and
by Berthold (1883).The Dresden statistics are in a dissertation by Stachelhausen
(Wurzburg, 1874), referred to by Birch-Hirschfeld, _Lehrb.837, Leipzig, 1877.The Erlangen statistics are reported by Ziemssen in _Volkmann's Samml.The Kiel report is in an inaugural dissertation by Greiss (Kiel, 1879),
referred to in the _Deutsche med.So far as possible, duodenal ulcers have been excluded.Only those
reports have been admitted which include both open ulcers and
cicatrices.]It is important to note the relative frequency of open ulcers as
compared with that of cicatrices.In 11,888 bodies examined in Prague,
there were found 164, or 1.4 per cent., with open ulcers, and 373, or
3.1 per cent., with cicatrices.Here scars were found about two and
one-fourth times as frequently as open ulcers.The observations of
Grunfeld in Copenhagen show that when especial attention is given to
searching for cicatrices in the stomach, they are found much more
frequently than the figures here given would indicate.[10] It would be
a moderate estimate to place the ratio of cicatrices to open ulcers at
3 to 1.[Footnote 10: Grunfeld (abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.141, 1883) in 1150 autopsies found 124 cicatrices in the stomach, or 11
per cent., but in only 450 of these cases was his attention especially
directed to their search, and in these he found 92 cases, or 20 per
cent., with scars.Grunfeld's statistics relate only to persons over
fifty years of age.Gastric ulcer, moreover, is extraordinarily common
in Copenhagen.The inexact nature of the ordinary statistics relating to cicatrices is
also evident from the fact that in the four collections of cases which
comprise the Prague statistics the percentage of open ulcers varies
only between 0.81 and 2.44, while the percentage of cicatrices varies
between 0.89 and 5.42.]The statistics concerning the average frequency of open ulcers are much
more exact and trustworthy than those relating to cicatrices.It may be
considered reasonably certain that, at least in Europe, open gastric
ulcers are found on the average in from 1 to 2 per cent.[11]

[Footnote 11: If in this estimate were included infants dying during
the first days of life, the percentage would be much smaller.]It is manifestly impossible to form an accurate estimate of the
frequency of gastric ulcer from the number of cases diagnosed as such
{483} during life, because the diagnosis is in many cases uncertain.Nevertheless, estimates upon this basis have practical clinical value.In 41,688 cases constituting the clinical material of Lebert[12] in
Zurich and in Breslau between the years 1853 and 1873, the diagnosis of
gastric ulcer was made in 252 cases, or about 2/3 per cent.[Footnote 12: Lebert, _op.Of 1699 cases of gastric ulcer collected from various hospital
statistics[13] and examined post-mortem, 692, or 40 per cent., were in
males, and 1007, or 60 per cent., were in females.The result of this
analysis makes the ratio 2 males to 3 females.[Footnote 13: These statistics include the previously-cited Prague,
Berlin, Dresden, and Erlangen cases so far as the sex is given, and in
addition the returns of Rokitansky, _op.cit._; Starcke (Jena),
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, Nos.26-29; Lebert, _op.cit._; Chambers,
_London Journ.of Med._, July, 1852; Habershon, _Dis.of the Abdomen_,
3d ed.Soc._, 1880; and the Munich
Hospital, _Annalen d. stadt.Only series of cases from the post-examinations of a number of years
have been admitted.It is an error to include isolated cases from
journals, as Brinton has done, because an undue number of these are
cases of perforation, which is a more common event in females than in
males.Thus, of 43 cases of gastric ulcer presented to the London
Pathological Society since its foundation up to 1882, 19, or 44 per
cent., were cases of perforation.In my cases are included a few
duodenal ulcers not easily separated from the gastric ulcers in the
compilation.]In order to determine from post-mortem records the age at which gastric
ulcer most frequently occurs, all cases in which only cicatrices are
found should be excluded, because a cicatrix gives no evidence as to
the age at which the ulcer existed.The following table gives the age in 607 cases of open ulcer collected
from hospital statistics[14] (post-mortem material):

    Age.----------+---------------+--------
   1-10.|        1      |

  ----------+---------------+--------

From this table it is apparent that three-fourths of the cases are
found between the ages of twenty and sixty, and that the cases are
distributed with tolerable uniformity between these four decades.The
largest number of cases is found between twenty and thirty.The
frequency of gastric ulcer after sixty years diminishes, although it
remains quite considerable, especially in view of the comparatively
small number of those living after that period.[Footnote 14: The sources of these statistics are the same as those of
the statistics relating to sex in the preceding foot-note.The age in
the Erlangen cases of open ulcer is given by Hauser (_Das chronische
Magengeschwur_, p.It is evident that only about
two-fifths of the cases could be utilized, partly because in some the
age was not stated, but mainly on account of the necessity of excluding
scars--a self-evident precaution which Brinton did not take.]The probability that many cases of ulcer included in the above table
existed for several years before death makes it desirable that
estimates as to the occurrence of the disease at different ages should
be made also from cases carefully diagnosed during life, although the
diagnosis must necessarily be less certain than that in the post-mortem
records.The best {484} statistics of this character which we possess
are those of Lebert, from whose work the following table has been
compiled:

Lebert_.----------+---------------+---------+----------

Of these cases, nearly seven-tenths were between twenty and forty years
of age--a preponderance sufficiently great to be of diagnostic
value.[16]

[Footnote 15: _Op.Of these cases, 19 were fatal, and
the diagnosis was confirmed after death.All of the cases were studied
by Lebert in hospitals in Zurich and Breslau.][Footnote 16: In my opinion, clinical experience is more valuable than
are post-mortem records in determining the age at which gastric ulcer
most frequently develops.In support of this opinion are the following
facts: In many cases no positive conclusions as to the age of the ulcer
can be drawn from the post-mortem appearances, and sufficient clinical
history is often wanting; a considerable proportion of the cases of
gastric ulcer do not terminate fatally with the first attack, but are
subject to relapses which may prove fatal in advanced life; in most
general hospitals the number of patients in advanced life is relatively
in excess of those in youth and middle age.By his faulty method of
investigating this question, Brinton came to the erroneous conclusion
that the liability to gastric ulcer is greatest in old age--a
conclusion which is opposed to clinical experience.]The oldest case on record is the one mentioned by Eppinger,[17] of an
old beggar whose age is stated at one hundred and twenty years.[Footnote 17: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.The occurrence of simple ulcer of the stomach under ten years of age is
extremely rare.Rokitansky, with his enormous experience, said that he
had never seen a case under fourteen years.[18] There are recorded,
however, a number of cases of gastric ulcer in infancy and childhood,
but there is doubt as to how many of these are genuine examples of
simple ulcer.Rehn in 1874 analyzed a number, although by no means all,
of the reputed cases, and found only six, or at the most seven, which
would stand criticism.[19] The age in these seven cases varied between
seven days and thirteen years.In one case (Donne) a cicatrix was found
in the stomach of a child three years old.Since the publication of
Rehn's article at least four apparently genuine cases have been
reported--namely, one by Reimer in a child three and a half years old;
one by Goodhart in an infant thirty hours after birth; one by Eross in
a girl twelve years old suffering from acute miliary tuberculosis, in
whom the ulcer perforated into the omental sac; and one by Malinowski
in a girl ten years of age.[20]

{485} the male than in the female.This is apparent from the following

In males the largest number of cases is found between thirty and forty
years, and in females between twenty and thirty.In males 54-1/2 per
cent.of the cases occur after forty years of age, and in females 48.9
per cent.[Footnote 21: These cases are obtained from the same sources as those
of the first table (page 483).]The relation between age and perforation of gastric ulcer will be
discussed in connection with this symptom.The conclusions concerning the age of occurrence of gastric ulcer may
be recapitulated as follows: Simple ulcer of the stomach most
frequently develops in the female between twenty and thirty, and in the
male between thirty and forty.At the post-mortem table it is found
with almost equal frequency in the four decades between twenty and
sixty, but clinically it appears with greatly diminished frequency
after forty years of age.In infancy and early childhood simple ulcer
of the stomach is a curiosity.We have no positive information as to the influence of climate upon the
production of gastric ulcer.The disease seems to be somewhat unequal
in its geographical distribution, but the data bearing upon this point
are altogether insufficient.According to the returns of Dahlerup and of Grunfeld, gastric ulcer is
unusually common in Copenhagen.[22] According to Starcke's
report[23]--which, however, is not based upon a large number of
cases--the percentage is also unusually high in Jena.Sperk says that
gastric ulcer is very common in Eastern Siberia.[24] Palgrave gives a
high percentage of its occurrence in Arabia.[25] The disease is less
common in France than in England or in Germany,[26] and in general
appears to be more common in northern than in southern countries.The
statement of DaCosta[27] coincides with my own impression that gastric
ulcer is less common in this country than in England or in Germany.I
have found 6 cases of open ulcer of the stomach in about 800 autopsies
made by me in New York.[Footnote 22: Dahlerup in Copenhagen (abstract in _Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1842) found 26 cases in 200 autopsies (13 per cent.)made in the course of a year and a half.cit._) found
124 cicatrices in 1150 autopsies (11 per cent.).]cit._) found 39 cases in 384 autopsies (10

expresses the same opinion in the _Proc.In 444,564 deaths in New York City from 1868 to 1882, inclusive, ulcer
of the stomach was assigned as the cause of death only in 410 cases.Little value can be assigned to these statistics as regards a disease
so difficult of diagnosis.]{486} Gastric ulcer is more common among the poor than among the rich.Anxiety, mental depression, scanty food, damp dwellings, insufficient
exercise, and exposure to extreme cold are among the depressing
influences which have been assigned as predisposing causes of gastric
ulcer, but without sufficient proof.The comparative frequency of gastric ulcer among needlewomen,
maidservants, and female cooks has attracted the attention of all who
have had large opportunity for clinical observation.Pressure upon the pit of the stomach, either by wearing tight belts or
in the pursuit of certain occupations, such as those of shoemaking, of
tailoring, and of weaving, is thought by Habershon and others to
predispose to ulcer of the stomach.[28]

[Footnote 28: Bernutz found gastric ulcer in a turner in porcelain, and
learned that other workmen in the same factory had vomited blood.He
thinks that in this and in similar occupations heavy particles of dust
collecting in the mouth and throat may be swallowed with the saliva,
and by their irritation cause gastric ulcer (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June
18, 1881).]Vomiting of blood has been known in several instances to affect a
number of members of the same family, but beyond this unsatisfactory
evidence there is nothing to show hereditary influence in the origin of
gastric ulcer.In a few cases injury of the region of the stomach, as by a fall or a
blow, has been assigned as the cause of ulcer.The efficacy of this
cause has been accepted by Gerhardt,[29] Lebert, Ziemssen, and others.In many of the cases in which this cause has been assigned the symptoms
of ulcer appeared so long after the injury that it is doubtful whether
there was any connection between the two.[Footnote 29: "Zur Aetiologie u. Therapie d. runden Magengeschwurz,"
_Wiener med.That loss of substance in the mucous membrane of the stomach may be the
result of injury directly or indirectly applied to this organ cannot
admit of question.But it is characteristic of these traumatic ulcers
that they rapidly heal unless the injury is so severe as to prove
speedily fatal.Thus, Duplay[30] relates three cases in which pain,
vomiting, repeated vomiting of blood, and dyspepsia followed contusions
of the region of the stomach.But these traumatic cases, which for a
time gave the symptoms of gastric ulcer, recovered in from two weeks to
two months, whereas the persistence of the symptoms is a characteristic
of simple ulcer.[31]

[Footnote 30: "Contusions de l'Estomac," _Arch.de Med._, Sept.,
1881.][Footnote 31: In a case reported by Potain, however, the symptoms of
ulcer appeared immediately after injury to the stomach, and continued
up to the time of death (_Gaz.In the same way, ulcers of the stomach produced by corrosive poisons as
a rule soon cicatrize, unless death follows after a short time the
action of the poison.That corrosive ulcers may, however, be closely
allied to simple ulcers is shown by an interesting case reported by
Wilson Fox,[32] in which the immediate effects of swallowing
hydrochloric acid were recovered from in about four days, but death
resulted from vomiting of blood two weeks after.At the autopsy the
source of the hemorrhage was found in an ulcer of the pyloric region of
the stomach.[33] A
boy who suffered severely for three or four days after drinking some
strong mineral acid recovered, so that he {487} ate and drank as usual.Two months afterward he died suddenly from perforation of a gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 33: _The Lancet_, April 9, 1842.]While, then, it would be a great error to identify traumatic and
corrosive ulcers of the stomach with simple ulcer, it is possible that
either may become chronic if associated with those conditions of the
stomach or of the constitution, for the most part unknown to us, which
prevent the ready healing of simple ulcer.Gastric ulcer is often associated with other diseases, but it occurs
also uncomplicated in a large number of cases.Most of the diseases
with which it has been found associated are to be regarded simply as
coincident or complicating affections; but as some of them have been
thought to cause the ulcer, they demand consideration in this
connection.The large share taken by pulmonary phthisis in deaths from all causes
renders this disease a frequent associate of gastric ulcer.It is
probable that the lowered vitality of phthisical patients increases
somewhat their liability to gastric ulcer.Moreover, it would not be
strange if gastric ulcer, as well as other exhausting diseases, such as
diabetes and cancer, diminished the power of resisting tuberculous
infection.Genuine tuberculous ulcers occur rarely in the stomach, but
they are not to be identified with simple ulcer.There is no proof that amenorrhoea or other disorders of menstruation
exert any direct influence in the production of gastric ulcer, although
Crisp went so far as to designate certain cases of gastric ulcer as the
menstrual ulcer.[34] Nevertheless, amenorrhoea is a very common symptom
or associated condition in the gastric ulcer of females between sixteen
and thirty years of age.[Footnote 34: _The Lancet_, Aug.Chlorosis and anaemia, especially in young women, favor the development
of gastric ulcer, but that there is no necessary relation between the
two is shown by the occurrence of ulcer in those previously robust.Moreover, it is probable that in some cases in which the anaemia has
been thought to precede the ulcer it has, in fact, been a result rather
than a cause of the ulcer.Especial interest attaches to the relation between gastric ulcer and
diseases of the heart and of the blood-vessels, because to disturbances
in the circulation in the stomach the largest share in the
pathenogenesis of ulcer has been assigned by Virchow.As might be
expected, valvular lesions of the heart and atheroma of the arteries
are not infrequently found in elderly people who are the subjects of
gastric ulcer.A small proportion of cases of ulcer has been associated
also with other diseases in which the arteries are often abnormal, such
as with chronic diffuse nephritis, syphilis, amyloid degeneration, and
endarteritis obliterans.But, after making the most generous allowance
for the influence of these diseases in the causation of ulcer of the
stomach, there remains a large number of cases of ulcer in which no
disease of the heart or of the arteries has been found.[35] Gastric
ulcer develops most frequently between fifteen and forty years of age,
a period when arterial diseases are not common.Changes in the {488}
blood-vessels of the stomach will be described in connection with the
morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 35: From Berlin are reported the largest number of cases of
gastric ulcer associated with diseases of the circulatory apparatus;
thus, by Berthold 170 out of 294 cases, and by Steiner 71 out of 110
cases of ulcer.Endocarditis and arterial atheroma (present in
one-third of Berthold's cases of ulcer) form the largest proportion of
these diseases.]Chronic passive congestion of the stomach in cases of cirrhosis of the
liver, direct injury to the mucous membrane of the stomach by parasites
in trichinosis, hemorrhage into the coats of the stomach in scorbutus
and in dementia paralytica, persistent vomiting in pregnancy, and
anaemia induced by prolonged lactation, have each been assigned as
causes in a few cases of gastric ulcer, but they are not associated
with gastric ulcer in enough cases to make their causative influence at
all certain.Galliard assigns diabetes mellitus as the cause in one case of gastric
ulcer.[36]

[Footnote 36: _Clin.de la Pitie_, Paris, 1877, p.Rokitansky attributed some cases of gastric ulcer to intermittent
fever.Those who believe in the inflammatory origin of ulcer of the stomach
think that chronic gastritis is an important predisposing cause.The abuse of alcohol is admitted as an indirect cause of gastric ulcer
by the majority of writers.Lastly, burns of the skin, which are an important factor in the
etiology of duodenal ulcers, have been followed only in a very few
instances by ulcer of the stomach.The direct causes of ulcer of the stomach, concerning which our
positive knowledge is very limited, will be considered under the
pathenogenesis of the disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The following classes of cases of gastric ulcer may be
distinguished:

First: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no symptoms pointing to its
existence, and be found accidentally at the autopsy when death has
occurred from some other disease.This latent course is most frequent
with gastric ulcers complicating chronic wasting diseases, such as
tuberculosis, and with gastric ulcers in elderly people.Second: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no marked symptoms before
profuse hemorrhage from the stomach or perforation of the stomach,
resulting speedily in death, occurs.Acute ulcers in anaemic females
from fifteen to thirty years of age are those most liable to perforate
without previous symptoms.Third: Gastric ulcer may occasion only the symptoms of chronic
gastritis, or of functional dyspepsia, or of purely nervous gastralgia,
so that its diagnosis is impossible.In this class of cases after a
time characteristic symptoms may develop.Here, too, sudden death may
occur from hemorrhage or from perforation.Fourth: In typical cases characteristic symptoms are present, so that
the diagnosis can be made more or less positively.These symptoms are
pain, and hemorrhage from the stomach, associated usually with vomiting
and disturbances of digestion.The different symptoms of gastric ulcer will now be described.Of all the symptoms, pain is the most constant and is often the first
to attract attention.It is absent throughout the disease only in
exceptional cases.In different cases, and often in the same case at
different times, the pain varies in its quality, its intensity, its
situation, its duration, and in other characteristics.The kind of pain which is most characteristic of gastric ulcer is
severe {489} paroxysmal pain strictly localized in a circumscribed spot
in the epigastrium, coming on soon after eating, and disappearing as
soon as the stomach is relieved of its contents.More common, although less characteristic, than the strictly localized
pain are paroxysms of severe pain, usually called cardialgic[37] or
gastralgic, diffused over the epigastrium and often spreading into the
surrounding regions.This is like the neuralgic pain of nervous
gastralgia, which is not infrequent in chlorotic and hysterical
females.The pain may be so intense as to induce syncope, or even
convulsions, in very sensitive patients.[Footnote 37: There is much confusion as to the meaning of the term
cardialgia.With most English and American writers it signifies
heartburn, while continental writers understand by cardialgia the
severe paroxysms of epigastric pain which we more frequently call
gastralgia.]The strictly localized pain is probably caused by direct irritation
confined to the nerves in the floor of the ulcer.In the diffuse
gastralgic attacks the irritation radiates or is reflected to the
neighboring nerves, and sometimes to those at a distance.In most cases of gastric ulcer localized epigastric pain and diffuse
gastralgic paroxysms are combined.The painful sense of oppression and fulness in the epigastrium which is
felt in many cases of gastric ulcer after eating is simply a dyspeptic
symptom, and is probably referable to an associated chronic catarrhal
gastritis.This dyspeptic pain is of little value in diagnosis.Most subjects of gastric ulcer feel in the intervals between the
paroxysms a more or less constant dull pain, or it may be only a sense
of uneasiness, in the epigastrium.When sharp epigastric pain is felt
continuously, it is usually inferred that the ulcer has extended to the
peritoneum and has caused a circumscribed peritonitis, but this
inference is not altogether trustworthy.The quality of the pain caused by gastric ulcer is described variously
as burning, gnawing, boring, less frequently as lancinating.More important than the quality is the situation of the pain.The
situation of the localized pain is usually at or a little below the
ensiform cartilage.It may, however, be felt as low as the umbilicus or
it may deviate to the hypochondria.In addition to pain in the
epigastrium (point epigastrique), Cruveilhier called attention to the
frequent presence of pain in the dorsal region (point rachidien).The
dorsal pain, which may be more severe than the epigastric, is sometimes
interscapular, and sometimes corresponds to the lowest dorsal or to the
upper lumbar vertebrae.It is usually a little to the left of the
spine.The pain is often described as extending from the pit of the
stomach through to the back.According to Brinton, the situation of the localized pain gives a clue
to the situation of the ulcer, pain near the left border of the
ensiform cartilage indicating ulcer near the cardiac orifice, pain in
the median line and to the right of this indicating ulcer of the
pyloric region, and pain in the left hypochondrium indicating ulcer of
the fundus.It does not often happen that the pain remains so sharply
localized as to make possible this diagnosis, even if the situation of
the pain were a safe guide.Of the various circumstances which influence the severity of the pain
in gastric ulcer, the most important is the effect of food.Pain
usually {490} comes on within a few minutes to half an hour after
taking food, although it may appear immediately after ingestion or be
delayed for an hour or more.The pain continues until the stomach is
relieved of its contents by vomiting or by their passage into the
duodenum.It is unsafe to attempt to diagnose the position of the ulcer
merely from the length of time which elapses between the ingestion of
food and the onset of pain.It has sometimes been noticed that as
improvement progresses pain comes on later and later after eating.As
might naturally be expected, coarse, indigestible,
imperfectly-masticated food, sour and spirituous liquids, and hot
substances are more irritating than bland articles of diet.In some
exceptional cases the ingestion of even coarse food, instead of
aggravating, has had no effect upon the pain, or at least for the time
being has even relieved it.External pressure usually increases the intensity of the pain of
gastric ulcer; in rare instances pressure relieves the pain.Rest and the recumbent posture as a rule alleviate the pain of ulcer of
the stomach.The position of the patient may affect the severity of the
pain in a more striking way.It may naturally be supposed that that
posture is most agreeable which removes from the ulcer the weight of
the food during digestion.Hence it was claimed by Osborne[38] that the
site of the ulcer could often be inferred from the effect of posture on
the pain.Thus, relief in the prone position would indicate ulcer of
the posterior wall; relief in the supine position, ulcer of the
anterior wall; relief on the left or on the right side, ulcer of the
pyloric or of the cardiac region respectively.As ulcer of the
posterior wall is the most frequent, relief should be obtained oftener
by bending forward or by lying on the face than in the supine position.Experience has shown that the influence of posture on the pain is not a
safe guide in diagnosing the location of the ulcer.[Footnote 38: Jonathan Osborne, _Dublin Journal of Medical Science_,
vol.Mental emotions--particularly anxiety and anger--fatigue, even moderate
exercise, exposure to cold, and the menstrual molimen may each cause
exacerbations of pain in some cases of gastric ulcer.Tenderness on pressure is a common symptom of gastric ulcer.A
localized point of tenderness may be discovered even when the
subjective pain is not localized.Pain sometimes follows pressure not
immediately, but after a brief interval.A fixed point of tenderness
can often be determined when the stomach is empty more accurately than
when it is full.The tender spot can sometimes be covered by the
finger's end.In searching for a point of tenderness it should be
remembered that many persons are very sensitive to pressure in the
epigastrium, and also that pressure is not without danger to those who
are the subjects of gastric ulcer.Not only may pressure induce
paroxysms of pain, but it may cause even rupture of the ulcerated walls
of the stomach.[39] Hence pressure should be cautiously employed and
should not be often repeated.[Footnote 39: Dalton has reported a case in which perforation of a
gastric ulcer occurred while the patient was subjected in a water-cure
establishment to kneading of the abdomen to relieve his flatulence
(_Trans.In some cases of gastric ulcer pain is felt in regions at a distance
from the stomach.The most frequent of these so-called radiation
neuralgias are--neuralgia of the lower intercostal spaces, combined
sometimes with {491} hyperaesthesia or with analgesia of the affected
region, pain in the right shoulder (perhaps due to adhesions between
the stomach and the liver or the diaphragm), pain in the left shoulder,
and pain in the loins.In a case of ulcer reported by Traube
terminating in perforation the sole complaint, besides loss of appetite
and retching, had been difficulty in breathing and oppression in the
chest.These symptoms, which may be combined with gastralgic paroxysms,
are referred by Traube to transference of the irritation from the
gastric to the pulmonary filaments of the pneumogastric nerve.[40]

[Footnote 40: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1861, No.These symptoms evidently
correspond to the vagus neurosis described by Rosenbach, in which, as
the result of reflex irritation of the pneumogastric nerve in the
stomach, occur difficulty in breathing, oppression in the chest,
palpitation, arhythmical action of the heart, and epigastric pulsation
(_Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1879, Nos.Sometimes the pain of gastric ulcer intermits for days or even weeks.When the intermission is of considerable duration it is probable that
cicatrization has been in progress.It should, however, be remembered
that gastralgic attacks may continue even after cicatrization of the
ulcer is completed, probably in consequence of compression of
nerve-filaments by the cicatricial tissue.Once in a while the pain
exhibits a marked periodicity in its appearance.Thus in a case of
ulcer ending fatally from hemorrhage the pain came on but once a day,
and that with considerable regularity at the same hour.In this case
the pain was relieved by taking food.[41] The pain of gastric ulcer may
be temporarily relieved by hemorrhage from the stomach, and perhaps by
division of the irritated nerve by sloughing (Habershon).[Footnote 41: Case reported by Peacock, _Rep.The causes of the pain of gastric ulcer are not far to seek.Foremost
is the irritation of nerve-filaments exposed by the ulcerative process.The irritation may be by mechanical, chemical, or thermic agencies.With our present imperfect knowledge it is profitless to discuss
whether the pneumogastric or the sympathetic nerves are the chief
carriers of the abnormal sensations.[42] In the next place, we may have
radiation of the irritation from these nerves to neighboring and even
to remote nerves.Furthermore, the extension of the inflammation to the
peritoneum and the surrounding parts, and the formation of adhesions,
are additional factors in some cases in causing pain.Finally, the
great differences in susceptibility to pain manifested by different
individuals is to be borne in mind.[Footnote 42: Leven, without sufficient reason, distinguishes two kinds
of gastralgic attacks--the one having its point of departure in the
pneumogastric, the other in the sympathetic nerve; in the former the
pain is associated with dyspnoea and palpitation of the heart; in the
latter the pain is deeper, and is accompanied by vaso-motor (?)troubles on one side of the body.]Next to pain, vomiting is the most frequent symptom of gastric ulcer.There is, however, little which is characteristic of ulcer in this
symptom, unless the vomited material contains blood.In some cases of
gastric ulcer vomiting is the most marked and most distressing symptom
of the disease.It may, however, be absent during the whole course of
gastric ulcer.Vomiting occurs most frequently after taking food, and is greatly
aggravated by an unregulated diet.Sometimes nearly everything which is
taken into the stomach is vomited.The vomiting of mucus or of a {492}
thin fluid unmixed with food is indicative only of chronic catarrhal
gastritis.Alimentary vomiting, which is more indicative of gastric
ulcer, usually occurs not immediately after taking food, but at the
acme of a gastralgic attack caused by the food.Soon after the stomach
is emptied by one or more acts of vomiting the pain is relieved.The
act of vomiting is usually easy, and at times is hardly more than
regurgitation of the food.Sometimes the patient experiences an
excessively sour taste from the vomit.Vomiting exhausts the patient by withdrawing nutriment, and when
persistent may even cause death from inanition.But in some cases of
gastric ulcer, especially in women, the vomiting seems to be mainly a
nervous symptom, and even when long continued may be attended by little
or no loss of flesh.Evidently, more food is retained in these cases
than might be supposed.There are two evident causes of vomiting in gastric ulcer--namely,
chronic catarrhal gastritis, which is a frequent complication, and
direct irritation of the nerves in the ulcer.Vomiting due to
dilatation of the stomach is oftener a sequel than an immediate symptom
of gastric ulcer.For the diagnosis of gastric ulcer hemorrhage from the stomach is the
most important symptom.The frequency of only the larger hemorrhages can be determined with any
degree of exactness.If the blood be effused in small quantity or
slowly, it may be discharged solely with the stools and escape
detection.Such slight hemorrhages doubtless occur in most cases of
gastric ulcer.It is probable that easily-recognized hemorrhages from
the stomach occur in about one-third of the cases of gastric ulcer.[43]
Hemorrhage is absent as a rule in the acute perforating ulcer of the
stomach.[Footnote 43: In consequence of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in
cases of gastric ulcer which recover without hemorrhage, the estimates
of the frequency of this symptom have a very limited value, and will
vary with different observers according to their standard of diagnosis
of this disease.Lebert observed gastric hemorrhage in four-fifths of
his carefully-studied cases, and in three-fifths of his cases there was
profuse haematemesis.Brinton estimates that the larger hemorrhages
occur in about one-third of the cases.Muller found them in one-fourth
of the cases which he analyzed.]In most cases hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is preceded by pain,
vomiting, and disturbances of digestion.Antecedent symptoms may,
however, be absent, or may be so obscure that no suspicion of ulcer
exists until the hemorrhage occurs.The hemorrhage may be slight, moderate, or excessive in amount
(Cruveilhier).The larger hemorrhages are those which are most
distinctive of gastric ulcer.The blood may be vomited, or voided with the stools, or retained in the
stomach and the intestines.As has been remarked, when the hemorrhage is scanty all the blood may
escape by the bowel.Sometimes, although much less frequently, blood
effused in large quantity is entirely evacuated with the stools.After
haematemesis more or less blood is discharged by the bowel, sometimes
for several days after the vomiting of blood has ceased.Blood which
has traversed the whole length of the intestinal canal acquires a tarry
consistence and a black or brownish color in consequence of the
production of dark-brown haematin by the action of the digestive juices
{493} upon the haemoglobin, and in consequence of the formation of
black sulphide of iron by the union of hydrogen sulphide in the lower
part of the intestine with the iron of the haematin.The passage of
these black viscid stools is called melaena.Inasmuch as we cannot
presume gastric hemorrhage to be absent simply because no blood has
been vomited, it is evidently important to examine the stools for blood
when the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is obscure, and also in cases of
gastric ulcer where there are symptoms of internal hemorrhage not
accounted for by blood vomited.It should be remembered that certain
drugs, particularly iron and bismuth, may blacken the feces.In very exceptional cases of gastric ulcer the effusion of a large
volume of blood causes sudden death before any of the blood has been
vomited.The autopsy shows the stomach and more or less of the small
intestine distended with coagulated blood.Hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is usually made manifest by the vomiting
of blood.The quantity of the vomited blood varies from mere traces to
several pounds.The color and the consistence of the blood depend upon
the quantity effused and the length of time that the blood has remained
in the stomach.Blood which has been acted upon by the gastric juice is
coagulated, has a grumous consistence, and acquires by the formation of
haematin out of haemoglobin a dark-brown color, often compared to that
of coffee-grounds.Blood effused in small quantity is usually vomited
only with the food, and has usually the coffee-grounds appearance.The
patient's condition is not appreciably influenced by this slight loss
of blood.A little blood expelled after repeated acts of vomiting has
no diagnostic importance.Vomiting usually occurs soon after a large
gastric hemorrhage.It is the mechanical distension of the stomach
rather than any irritating quality of the blood which causes the
vomiting.Blood which is rejected immediately after a large gastric
hemorrhage is alkaline, fluid, and of an arterial (rarely of a venous)
hue.Often, however, even with large hemorrhages, the blood remains
sufficiently long in the stomach to be partly coagulated and to be
darkened in color.Ulcer more frequently than any other disease of the
stomach causes the vomiting of unaltered blood in large quantity.But
this kind of haematemesis is not peculiar to simple ulcer.It may occur
in other diseases, such as gastric cancer, and coffee-ground vomiting
may be associated with ulcer.Copious haematemesis in cases of gastric ulcer appears usually without
premonition, or it may be preceded for a day or two by increased pain.Its occurrence is somewhat more common during the digestion of food
than in the intervals, but there have been cases of ulcer where the
bleeding was favored by an empty stomach and was checked by the
distension of the organ with food.The free use of stimulants and
violent physical or mental exertion may excite hemorrhage.With the
onset of the hemorrhage the patient experiences a sense of warmth and
of oppression at the epigastrium, followed by faintness, nausea, and
the vomiting of a large quantity of blood.An attack of syncope often
causes, at least temporarily, cessation of the hemorrhage.But the
thrombus which closes the eroded vessel may easily be washed away, so
that the hemorrhage often recurs and continues at intervals for several
days, thereby greatly increasing the danger to the patient.Thus, the
tendency is for {494} the hemorrhage from gastric ulcer to appear in
phases or periods occupying several days.A single hemorrhage is rarely so profuse as to cause immediate death.More frequently the patient dies after successive hemorrhages.In the
majority of cases the hemorrhage is not immediately dangerous to life,
but is followed by symptoms of anaemia, more or less profound according
to the strength of the patient and the amount of blood lost.Prostration and pallor follow the larger hemorrhages.Dizziness,
ringing in the ears, and dimness of vision appear when the patient
attempts to leave the recumbent posture.Thirst is often a marked
symptom.The pulse is feeble and more frequent than normal.There is
often a moderate elevation of temperature (anaemic fever) after profuse
hemorrhage.The urine is pale, abundant, and sometimes contains albumen
(Quincke).After a few days anaemic cardiac murmurs can often be heard.Under favorable circumstances these symptoms of anaemia disappear in
the course of a few weeks.The other symptoms of ulcer, particularly the pain, are sometimes
notably relieved, and may even disappear, after an abundant hemorrhage.They usually, however, return sooner or later.After a variable
interval one attack of haematemesis is likely to be followed by others.There is much diversity in different cases as regards the frequency of
these attacks and the character of the symptoms in the intervals.In a
few cases recovery follows a single attack of gastric hemorrhage; in
other cases the hemorrhage recurs frequently after intervals of only a
few days, weeks, or months; in still other cases hemorrhage recurs only
after long intervals, perhaps of years, although other symptoms of
ulcer continue.Sometimes the disappearance of symptoms indicates only
an apparent cure, and later the patient dies suddenly while in apparent
health by a profuse gastric hemorrhage.In the rare cases of this last
variety Cruveilhier has found sometimes that the ulcer has cicatrized
except just over the eroded blood-vessel.The sources of the hemorrhage in gastric ulcer will be described in
connection with the morbid anatomy.The symptoms of gastric indigestion are commonly, although not
constantly, present in gastric ulcer.They may constitute the sole
symptoms, in which case the diagnosis of the lesion is impossible.The
most important local symptoms of gastric dyspepsia are diminution, less
frequently perversion or increase, of the appetite; increased thirst;
during digestion, and sometimes independent of digestion, a feeling of
discomfort merely or of painful oppression, or even of sharp pain, in
the epigastrium; nausea; vomiting of undigested food, of mucus, and of
bile; regurgitation of thin fluids; often acid, sometimes neutral or
alkaline, flatulence, with belching of gas, and constipation.In many
cases of gastric ulcer the appetite is not disturbed, but the patient
refrains from eating on account of the pain caused by taking food.Among the so-called sympathetic symptoms of dyspepsia are headache,
dizziness, depression of spirits, oppression in the chest, and
irregularity of the heart's action.Dyspepsia contributes its share to
the production of the anaemia and of the loss of flesh and strength
which are present in some degree in most cases of chronic gastric
ulcer.{495} In many cases of acute perforating ulcer, as well as in some
cases of chronic ulcer, the symptoms are either absent or they are but
slightly marked.It has been demonstrated that in many cases of gastric
ulcer the resorptive power of the mucous membrane of the stomach is
unimpaired.[44]

[Footnote 44: This is shown by the experiments of Pentzoldt and Faber,
who determined the length of time which elapsed between swallowing
gelatin capsules containing iodide of potassium and the appearance of
the iodide in the saliva (_Berl.Quetsch observed rapid absorption from the stomach in two cases of
gastric ulcer (_ibid._, 1884, No.It is believed that also the
duration of the digestive process in the stomach is often within normal
limits in cases of gastric ulcer, although exact experiments upon this
point, as they require the use of the stomach-pump, have not been made
in this disease (Leube).]The most common cause of dyspepsia in gastric ulcer is the chronic
catarrhal gastritis which usually accompanies this disease.It is
probable that the movements of the stomach may be seriously interfered
with by destruction of the muscular coat of the stomach when the ulcer
is of considerable size and is seated in the pyloric region.Adhesions
of the stomach to surrounding parts may likewise impair the normal
movements of the stomach.It is possible that ulcers, especially those
which are very painful, may cause reflex disturbance of the peristaltic
movements of the stomach and alterations in the quality or the quantity
of the gastric juice.The serious digestive disturbances which are
caused by distortions and dilatation of the stomach resulting from
cicatricial contraction of gastric ulcer are not considered in this
article.Although Niemeyer emphasized the frequency in gastric ulcer of a
strikingly red tongue with smooth or furrowed surface, it does not
appear that any especial importance is to be attached to this or to any
other condition of the tongue as a symptom of the disease.Increased flow of saliva is a rare symptom, which, when it occurs, is
usually associated with dyspepsia.Constipation is the rule in gastric ulcer.The most important of the
various circumstances which combine to produce this condition is the
small amount of solid food taken and retained by the patient.The
restraint caused by gastric ulcer and gastric catarrh in the normal
movements of the stomach may diminish by reflex action the peristalsis
of the intestines (Traube and Radziejewski).The passage of large
quantities of blood along the intestinal canal is often associated with
colicky pains and diarrhoea.Amenorrhoea is a symptom which was formerly thought to be
characteristic of gastric ulcer, although there was much discussion as
to whether it was the cause or the result of the ulcer.Amenorrhoea is
indeed common in the gastric ulcer of young women, but there is nothing
strange in this when one considers the frequency of amenorrhoea in
general, and its causation by various debilitating and depressing
influences such as are to be found in gastric ulcer.Notwithstanding a
few striking cases which have been recorded, it has not been
demonstrated that hemorrhages vicarious of menstruation take place from
gastric ulcer.Gastric ulcer is not a febrile disease.Temporary elevation of
temperature may follow profuse gastrorrhagia and may attend various
complications, of which the most important are gastritis and
peritonitis.It has been recently claimed by Peter that the
surface-temperature of the {496} epigastrium is elevated in gastric
ulcer, but the observations upon this point are as yet too few for any
positive conclusions.[45]

[Footnote 45: According to Peter, the normal surface-temperature of the
epigastrium is from 95-1/2 degrees to 96 degrees F.(35.3 degrees to
35.5 degrees C.), while in gastric ulcer the temperature may equal or
even exceed by one or two degrees the axillary temperature.It is said
to register the highest during attacks of pain and of vomiting and
after hemorrhages (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June 23 and 30, 1883).See also
Beaurieux (_Essai sur la Pseudo-gastralgie, etc._, These, Paris,
1879).]The general health of the patient remains sometimes surprisingly good,
even in cases of gastric ulcer with symptoms sufficiently marked to
establish the diagnosis.But in most cases of chronic gastric ulcer the
general nutrition sooner or later becomes impaired.This cannot well be
otherwise when dyspepsia, vomiting, paroxysms of severe pain, and
hemorrhage are present, separately or in combination, for any great
length of time.In proportion to the severity and the continuance of
these symptoms the patient becomes pale, weak, and emaciated.The face,
thin, anxious, of a grayish-white color, and marked with sharp lines of
suffering, presents the appearance which the older writers called
facies abdominalis, to which even so recent an author as Brinton
attaches exaggerated diagnostic importance.A little cachectic dropsy
may appear about the ankles.While it is true that the general
nutrition is less rapidly, less continuously, and, as a rule, less
deeply, impaired in gastric ulcer than in gastric cancer, nevertheless
sometimes a cachexia develops in the former which is not to be
distinguished from that of cancer.Litten[46] relates a case of gastric
ulcer which simulated for a time pernicious anaemia.In this case the
profound anaemia could not be explained by vomiting, hemorrhage, or
other symptoms of ulcer.[Footnote 46: _Berliner klin.Beyond determining the existence of a fixed point of epigastric
tenderness, physical examination of the region of the stomach is
usually only of negative value in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer.In
some cases of ulcer of the stomach epigastric pulsation is very marked,
and sometimes most marked during gastralgic attacks.In these cases
there may be dilatation of the aorta from paralysis of vaso-motor
nerves analogous to the dilatation of the carotid and temporal arteries
in certain forms of migraine (Rosenbach).When the diagnosis lies
between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer, the presence of epigastric
tumor is justly considered to weigh against ulcer; but it is important
to know that tumor may be associated with ulcer.Thickening of the
tissues around old ulcers and the presence of adhesions may give rise
to a tumor.A thickened portion of omentum which had become adherent
over an old gastric ulcer produced a tumor which led to a mistake in
the diagnosis.[47] Rosenbach[48] calls attention to the occasional
production of false tumors by spasm of the muscular coat of the stomach
around a gastric ulcer.These tumors disappear spontaneously or yield
to the artificial distension of the stomach by Seidlitz powders--a
procedure which one would not venture to adopt if he suspected gastric
ulcer.Fenwick thinks that in some cases of gastric ulcer fixation of
the stomach by adhesions can be made out by physical exploration.[Footnote 47: A. Beer, _Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, p.The gravest symptom which can occur in gastric ulcer is the perforation
of the ulcer into the general peritoneal cavity.{497} Only rough estimates can be made of the frequency of this
symptom.These estimates vary from 2 to 25 per cent.From the data
which I have collected I infer that perforation into the general
peritoneal cavity occurs in about 6-1/2 per cent.of all cases of
gastric ulcer.[49]

[Footnote 49: Miquel (_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.65, 1864) reckons
the frequency of perforation at 2 per cent.Brinton's estimate of
13-1/2 per cent.He found 69 cases of
perforation in 257 open ulcers collected from various sources.He
doubles the number of open ulcers, as he considers cicatrized ulcers
twice as frequent as the open.The statistics of some of the authors to
whom he refers should not be used in this computation, either because
they do not give accurately the number of cases of perforation, or
because they include under perforation all cases of ulcer which have
penetrated all of the coats of the stomach, whereas of course only
perforation into the general peritoneal cavity should be here included.Valuable and laborious as are Brinton's researches, his statistics upon
this point, as upon many others, are inaccurate.In 249 fatal cases of open ulcer taken from the statistics of Jaksch,
Dittrich, Willigk, Wrany (_Prager Vierteljahr._, vols.),
Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Moore, and Lebert (_loc.cit._), I find 50
cases of perforation into the peritoneal cavity.This makes the
percentage of perforations 6-1/2 if the open ulcers be multiplied by 3,
the number of cicatrized ulcers being taken as three times that of open
ulcers (p.This method of computation, which is adopted by
Brinton, is defective on account of the uncertainty as to the proper
proportion between cicatrized and open ulcers.Lebert observed 9 cases of perforation with fatal peritonitis in his
252 cases studied clinically.He places the frequency of perforation
with peritonitis at 3 to 5 per cent., which corresponds to Engel's
estimate of 5-1/2 per cent.(_Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, 1853, ii.).]As regards sex, perforation occurs two to three times oftener in the
female than in the male.This increased liability is referable mainly
to the preponderance of the acute perforating ulcer in young women.[50]

[Footnote 50: The liability to perforation in females seems to be not
only absolutely, but also relatively, to the number of ulcers greater
than in males, although, on the contrary, Brinton holds that the excess
of perforations in females is not greater than that of ulcers.Berthold
found perforation in 3.1 per cent.of the cases of gastric ulcer in
males, and in 9.7 per cent.In the female the liability to perforation of gastric ulcer is greatest
between fourteen and thirty years of age.In the male there seems to be
no greater liability to perforation at one age than at another.[51]

[Footnote 51: Of 139 cases of perforated ulcer in females, Brinton
found that four-fifths occurred before the age of thirty-five.He
calculates the average age at which perforation occurs in the female as
twenty-seven, and in the male as forty-two.He thinks that the average
liability to perforation in both sexes decreases as life advances,
although he holds that the liability to ulcer itself constantly
increases with age.]As will be explained in considering the morbid anatomy, ulcers of the
anterior wall of the stomach perforate more frequently than those in
other situations.As regards the symptoms which may have preceded perforation three
groups of cases can be distinguished:

In the first there has been no complaint of gastric disturbance.In the
midst of apparent health perforation may occur and cause death within a
few hours.This is the ulcere foudroyante of French writers.It is met
with more commonly in chlorotic young women than in any other class.In the second group of cases, which are more frequent, gastric symptoms
have been present for a longer or shorter time, but have been so
ambiguous that the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not clear until
perforation occurs.Then, unfortunately, the diagnosis is of little
more than retrospective interest.In the third group of cases perforation takes place in the course of
gastric ulcer, the existence of which has been made evident by
characteristic symptoms, such as localized pain and profuse hemorrhage.{498} The immediate cause of perforation of gastric ulcer is often some
agency which produces mechanical tension of the stomach, such as
distension of the organ with food or with gas, vomiting, straining at
stool, coughing, sneezing, pressure on the epigastrium, violent
exertion, and jolting of the body.With the escape of the solid, the fluid, and the gaseous contents of
the stomach into the peritoneal cavity at the moment of perforation, an
agonizing pain is felt, beginning in the epigastrium and extending
rapidly over the abdomen, which becomes very sensitive to pressure.The
pain sometimes radiates to the shoulders.Symptoms of collapse often
appear immediately or they may develop gradually.The pulse becomes
small, rapid, and feeble.The face is pale, anxious, and drawn (facies
hippocratica).The surface of the body, particularly of the
extremities, is cold and covered with clammy sweat.The internal
temperature may be subnormal, normal, or elevated; after the
development of peritonitis it is usually, but not always, elevated.Consciousness is usually retained to the last, although the patient is
apathetic.Vomiting is sometimes absent--a circumstance which may be of
value in diagnosis, and which Traube attributes to the readiness with
which the contents of the stomach can be discharged through the
abnormal opening into the peritoneal cavity.The respirations become more and more frequent and costal
in type.Suppression of urine is not an
uncommon symptom, although there may be frequent and painful attempts
at micturition.Albumen and casts may appear temporarily in the urine.Retraction of one testicle, like that in renal colic, has been observed
(Blomfield).The patient usually lies on his back with the knees drawn
up.The abdomen is often at first hard and retracted from spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal muscles, but later it usually becomes
tympanitic, sometimes to an extreme degree.The presence of tympanitic
resonance replacing hepatic dulness in front is usually considered the
most important physical sign of gas free in the peritoneal cavity, but
this sign is equivocal.On the one hand, the presence of adhesions over
the anterior surface of the liver may prevent the gas from getting
between the liver and the diaphragm;[52] and on the other hand, in
cases of meteorism coils of intestine may make their way between the
liver and the diaphragm, or the liver may be pushed upward and
backward, so that its anterior surface becomes superior and the hepatic
dulness in front disappears.Physical examination may reveal in the
dependent parts of the peritoneal cavity an accumulation of fluid
partly escaped from the stomach and partly an inflammatory exudate.[53]
For humane reasons one should not submit the patient to the pain of
movement in order to elicit a succussion sound or to determine change
in the position of the fluid upon changing the position of the
patient.[54] There is sometimes relief from pain for some hours before
death.[Footnote 52: Even without these adhesions liver dulness may persist
after perforation of the stomach, as in a case of Nothnagel's in which
for twenty-four hours after a large perforation from gastric ulcer the
abdomen was retracted and hepatic dulness was well marked (Garmise,
_Ulcus Ventriculi cum peritonitide perforativa_, Inaug.Diss., Jena,
1879).][Footnote 53: In a case of peritonitis resulting from perforation of a
latent ulcer of the duodenum, Concato found in the acid fluid withdrawn
by aspiration from the peritoneal cavity Sarcina ventriculi (_Giorn.delle Scienze Med._, 1879, No.[Footnote 54: Other symptoms which have been thought to be diagnostic
of pneumo-peritoneum in {499} distinction from meteorism, but the value
of which is doubtful, are these: In pneumo-peritoneum the respiratory
murmur can be heard by auscultation over the entire abdomen, while in
meteorism it does not extend beyond the region of the stomach
(Cantani); in the former amphoric sounds synchronous with respiration
can sometimes be heard over the abdomen (Larghi); borborygmi are heard,
if at all, distantly and feebly; the percussion note of gas free over
the liver is different from that of tympanitic intestine (Traube); the
percussion note is of the same character over the whole anterior wall
of the abdomen; the epigastric region is more elastic to the feel than
in tympanites; the distension of the abdomen is more uniform than in
tympanites; and coils of distended intestine, sometimes showing
peristaltic movement, cannot be seen or felt as in some cases of
meteorism (Howitz).]There are exceptional cases of perforation in which some of the most
important of the enumerated symptoms, such as pain, tenderness of the
abdomen on pressure, tympanites, and the symptoms of collapse, are
absent.Death sometimes occurs from shock within six or eight hours after
perforation.More frequently life is prolonged from eighteen to
thirty-six hours, it may be even for three or four days, and, very
rarely, even longer.[55] When life is prolonged more than twelve hours
an acute diffuse peritonitis is usually but not always developed.[Footnote 55: In the _Descriptive Catalogue of the Warren Anatomical
Museum_, by Dr.J. B. S. Jackson, p.448, Boston, 1870, is described a
case of gastric ulcer in which, so far as can be judged by the symptoms
and the post-mortem appearances, the patient lived nineteen days after
perforation.]The contents of the stomach, instead of being diffused throughout the
peritoneal cavity, may be confined by a rapidly-developed circumscribed
peritonitis to a space near the stomach, or perforation may occur into
a space previously shut off from the general peritoneal sac by
adhesions.In this way circumscribed peritoneal abscesses form in the
neighborhood of the stomach.Diffuse peritonitis may be caused either
by an extension of the inflammation or by the rupture of these
abscesses into the general peritoneal cavity.The cases of
circumscribed peritonitis following perforation of gastric ulcer, with
escape of the contents of the stomach, although more protracted than
those in which the whole peritoneal surface is at once involved,
generally terminate fatally sooner or later.The most interesting of these peritoneal abscesses is the variety to
which Leyden has given the name of pyo-pneumothorax subphrenicus (false
pneumothorax of Cossy), the diagnostic features of which first were
recognized by G. W. Barlow and Wilks in 1845.[56] Here there is a
cavity, circumscribed by adhesions, just beneath the diaphragm,
containing pus and gas and communicating with either the stomach or the
intestine.By the encroachment of this cavity upon the thoracic space
the symptoms and signs of pyo-pneumothorax are simulated.Barlow and
Leyden have diagnosed during life this affection when resulting from
perforated gastric ulcer.The points in diagnosis from genuine
pyo-pneumothorax are the presence of respiratory murmur from the
clavicle to the third rib, the extension of the respiratory murmur
downward by deep inspiration, history of preceding gastric disturbance
with circumscribed peritonitis, absence of preceding pulmonary
symptoms, rapid variations in the limits of dulness with changes in the
position of the body, absence or only slight evidence of increased
intrapleural pressure (such as bulging of the {500} thorax as a whole,
and of the intercostal spaces), displacement of the heart, displacement
of the liver downward, and, if necessary, the determination by means of
a manometer that the pressure in the abscess cavity rises during
inspiration and falls during expiration, the reverse being true in
genuine pneumothorax.[57]

[Footnote 56: Barlow and Wilks, _London Med.Gazette_, May, 1845;
Leyden, _Zeitschr.Med._, i. Heft 2; Cossy, _Arch.de
Med._, Nov., 1879; Tillmanns, _Arch.[Footnote 57: Schreiber has shown that this last diagnostic point,
which was given by Leyden, is not without exceptions, for the pressure
in the peritoneal cavity may sink during inspiration and rise during
expiration (as in the pleural cavity), especially when the diaphragm
takes little or no part in respiration ("Ueber Pleural- und
Peritonealdruck," _Deutsches Arch.Med._, July 31, 1883).]Through the medium of subphrenic abscess, or directly through adhesions
between the stomach and the diaphragm, gastric ulcer may perforate into
one of the pleural cavities (generally the left) and cause empyema or
pneumo-pyothorax.Adhesions may form between the diaphragm and the
pulmonary pleura, so that the ulcer perforates directly into the lung;
in which case pulmonary gangrene or pulmonary abscess is usually
developed.The diagnosis of the perforation into the lung has been made
by recognizing a sour odor and sour reaction of the expectoration, and
by finding in the sputum particles of food derived from the stomach.Sudden death from suffocation has followed perforation of the stomach
into the lung.[58]

[Footnote 58: Tillmanns (_loc.cit._) has collected 12 cases of
communication between the stomach and the thoracic cavity from
perforation of gastric ulcer; all proved fatal.In Sturges's case of
recovery from pneumothorax supposed to be produced by perforation of a
gastric ulcer the diagnosis of the cause of the pneumothorax was very
doubtful (_The Lancet_, Feb.Perforation of gastric ulcer into the transverse colon has been
followed by the vomiting of formed feces and by the passage of
undigested food by the bowel (Abercrombie).Enemata may be vomited, so
that, as suggested by Murchison, the introduction of  enemata
may aid in the diagnosis.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are among the rare results of perforation of
gastric ulcer.In these cases food, sometimes only in liquid form,
escapes through the fistula.The opening of gastric ulcer into the pericardium is one of the rare
causes of pneumo-pericardium.Other varieties of perforation which are of pathological rather than of
clinical interest will be mentioned under the morbid anatomy of gastric
ulcer.COURSE.--Few diseases are more variable in their course and duration
than is simple gastric ulcer.It is customary to distinguish between
acute and chronic forms of gastric ulcer, but this is a distinction
which cannot be sharply drawn.Those cases are called acute in which,
with absence or short duration of antecedent gastric symptoms,
perforation or gastrorrhagia suddenly causes death.But in some of
these cases the thickened and indurated margins of the ulcer found at
the autopsy show that the disease has been of much longer duration than
the clinical history would indicate.Still, there is reason to believe
that within the course of a few days ulcers may form and perforate all
of the coats of the stomach.In the great majority of cases of gastric ulcer the tendency is to
assume a chronic course, so that the often-used term chronic gastric
ulcer is generally applicable.{501} The great diversity of the symptoms in different cases makes it
impossible to give a generally applicable description of the course of
gastric ulcer.It is, however, useful to designate the main clinical
forms of the disease.Sandra travelled to the office.Latent ulcers, with entire absence of symptoms, and revealed as open
ulcers or as cicatrices at the autopsy.With or without a period of brief gastric
disturbance perforation occurs and causes speedy death.Acute hemorrhagic form of gastric ulcer.After a latent or a brief
course of the ulcer profuse gastrorrhagia occurs, which may terminate
fatally or may be followed by the symptoms of chronic ulcer.Gastralgic-dyspeptic form.In this, which is the most common form of
gastric ulcer gastralgia, dyspepsia and vomiting are the symptoms.Sometimes one of the symptoms predominates greatly over the others, so
that Lebert distinguishes separately a gastralgic, a dyspeptic, and a
vomitive variety.Gastralgia is the most frequent symptom.Gastrorrhagia is a marked symptom, and
occurs usually in combination with the symptoms just mentioned.This usually corresponds only to the final stage of
one of the preceding forms, but the cachexia may develop so rapidly and
become so marked that the course of the disease closely resembles that
of gastric cancer.In this the symptoms of gastric ulcer disappear, and
then follow intervals, often of considerable duration, in which there
is apparent cure, but the symptoms return, especially after some
indiscretion in the mode of living.This intermittent course may
continue for many years.In these cases it is probable either that
fresh ulcers form or that the cicatrix of an old ulcer becomes
ulcerated.By the formation of cicatricial tissue in and around
the ulcer the pyloric orifice becomes obstructed and the symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach develop.DURATION.--The average duration of gastric ulcer may be said to be from
three to five years, but this estimate is not of great value, on
account of the absence of any regularity in the course and duration of
the disease.In cases of very protracted duration, such as forty years
in a case of Habershon's and thirty-five in one of Brinton's, it is
uncertain whether the symptoms are referable to the persistence of one
ulcer or to the formation of new ulcers, or to sequels resulting from
cicatrization.In 110 cases (44 fatal) analyzed by Lebert[59] the course was latent
until the occurrence of perforation or of profuse hemorrhage in 15 per
cent., the duration was less than one year in 18 per cent., from one to
six years in 46-1/2 per cent., from six to twenty years in 18 per
cent., from twenty to thirty-five years in 2-1/2 per cent.TERMINATIONS.--In the majority of cases gastric ulcer terminates in
recovery.Various gastric disturbances
may, however, follow the cicatrization of gastric ulcer, especially if
the ulcer was large and of long duration.These sequential disturbances
are due to the contraction of the cicatrix, to adhesions between the
stomach and surrounding parts, to deformity of the stomach, and
especially to dilatation of the stomach by cicatricial stenosis of the
pylorus.Hence, {502} gastralgia, dyspepsia, and vomiting may continue
after the ulcer has healed, so that anatomical cure of the ulcer is not
always recovery in the clinical sense.Relapses may occur after
recovery, as those who have once had gastric ulcer are more prone to
the disease than are others.Not infrequently the patient recovers so
far as to be able to attend to the active duties of life, but to avoid
renewed attacks he is always obliged to be very careful as regards his
mode of living.How often gastric ulcer ends in death it is impossible to say.It is
certain that Brinton under-estimates the number of recoveries when he
computes that only one-half of the ulcers cicatrize.Lebert reckons the
mortality from gastric ulcer as 10 per cent., which appears to be too
low an estimate.would be a more correct estimate
of the mortality.The causes of death are perforation, hemorrhage, exhaustion, and
complicating diseases.of the cases of gastric ulcer terminate fatally
by perforation into the peritoneal cavity.Although this estimate can
be considered only approximative, there is little doubt but that the
much larger percentages given by most writers are excessive, and are
referable to the undue frequency with which cases of perforation of
gastric ulcer have been published.Such cases naturally make a strong
impression upon the observer, and are more likely to be published than
those which terminate in other ways.Death from hemorrhage occurs probably in from 3 to 5 per cent.of the
cases of gastric ulcer.[60] In many more cases hemorrhage is an
indirect cause of death by inducing anaemia.Unlike perforation, fatal
hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is more common in males than in
females--more common after than before forty years of age.The average
age at which fatal hemorrhage occurs is given by Brinton as forty-three
and a half years both for males and females.[Footnote 60: In 270 fatal cases of open ulcer from the statistics of
Jaksch, Dittrich, Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Habershon, Moore, and
Lebert, I find 27 deaths by hemorrhage.Reckoning three cicatrices to
one ulcer, this would give a percentage of 3-1/3.]In a considerable proportion of the fatal cases exhaustion is the cause
of death.According to Lebert, death from exhaustion occurs in about 4
per cent.The causes of exhaustion are
the pain, hemorrhage, dyspepsia, and vomiting which constitute the
leading symptoms of the disease.Finally, death may be due to some of the complications or sequels of
gastric ulcer.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric ulcer are directly
referable to the ulcer, others are only remotely related to it, and
others are merely accidental.Pylephlebitis is among the most important of the complications directly
referable to the ulcer.This pylephlebitis is usually of the infectious
variety, and leads to abscesses in the liver, sometimes to abscesses in
the spleen and other organs.As has already been mentioned, chronic catarrhal gastritis stands in
close relationship to gastric ulcer.Chronic peritonitis is a rare
complication of gastric ulcer (Moore, Vierordt).Chronic interstitial
gastritis, with contraction of the stomach and thickening of its walls,
was {503} associated with ulcer in a case under my observation.In a
case of ulcer under the care of Owen Rees[61] this condition of the
stomach was associated with chronic deforming peritonitis (thickening,
induration, and contraction of the peritoneum) and ascites, so that the
symptoms during life and the gross appearances after death resembled
cancerous diseases of the peritoneum.Simple ulcer and cancer may occur
together in the same stomach, or cancer may develop in an ulcer or its
cicatrix.Glasser reports a case of phlegmonous gastritis with gastric
ulcer.[62] Extension of inflammation to the pleura without perforation
of the diaphragm sometimes occurs.Fatty degeneration of the heart may
be the result of profound anaemia induced by gastric ulcer.[63] Embolic
pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia are occasional complications.A
moderate degree of cachectic dropsy is not very infrequent in the late
stages of gastric ulcer.Times and Gaz._, April 24, 1869.]Wochenschrift_, 1883, No.[Footnote 63: Shattuck, _Boston Med.Journ._, June, 1880,
vol.Other complications, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, valvular disease
of the heart, general atheroma of the arteries, cirrhosis of the liver,
syphilis, chronic Bright's disease, waxy degenerations, and malaria,
have been considered under the Etiology, and some of them will be
referred to again in connection with the Pathology, of gastric ulcer.In most instances when ulcer is associated with these diseases the
ulcer is secondary.SEQUELAE.--The most important sequelae of gastric ulcer are changes in
the form of the stomach in consequence of adhesions and in consequence
of the formation and contraction of cicatrices.These lesions are most
conveniently described under the Morbid Anatomy.The symptoms of the
most important of these sequels--namely, stenosis of the pylorus with
dilatation of the stomach--will be described in another article.MORBID ANATOMY.--As regards number, simple ulcer of the stomach is
usually single, but occasionally two or more ulcers are present.It is
not uncommon to meet in the same stomach open ulcers and the scars of
healed ulcers.According to Brinton, multiple ulcers are found in about
one-fifth of the cases.In one case O'Rorke found six ulcers on the
anterior wall of the stomach.[64] Berthold mentions a case in which
thirty-four ulcers were found in the same stomach.[65]

[Footnote 64: _Trans.Wollmann mentions the occurrence of over eight simple ulcers in the
same stomach (_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1868, Bd.It is expressly stated that these were
not hemorrhagic erosions, but deep corrosive ulcers.]The usual position of simple gastric ulcer is the posterior wall of the
pyloric portion of the stomach on or near the lesser curvature.Ulcers
of the anterior wall are rare, but they carry a special danger from
their liability to perforate without protective adhesions.The least
frequent seats of ulcer are the greater curvature and the fundus.The table on page 504 gives the situation of 793 ulcers recorded in
hospital statistics:[66] {504}

  Lesser curvature   288 (36.3 per cent.)Posterior wall     235 (29.6    "     )
  Pylorus             95 (12      "     )
  Anterior wall       69 ( 8.7    "     )
  Cardia              50 ( 6.3    "     )
  Fundus              29 ( 3.7    "     )
  Greater curvature   27 ( 3.4    "     )

From this table it is apparent that ulcers occupy the lesser curvature,
the posterior wall, and the pyloric region three and a half times more
frequently than they do the remaining larger segment of the stomach.[Footnote 66: These statistics are collected from the previously-cited
works of Rokitansky, Jaksch, Wrany, Eppinger, Chambers, Habershon,
Steiner, Wollmann, Berthold, Starcke, Lebert, and Moore.So far as noted, most of the ulcers on the posterior wall
were nearer to the lesser curvature than to the greater; those on the
lesser curvature extended more frequently to the posterior than to the
anterior wall.Although not apparent from the table, most of the ulcers
of the lesser curvature and of the posterior wall were in the pyloric
region.So far as possible, cicatrices were excluded.Pylorus and
cardia in the table indicate on or near those parts.]Occasionally two ulcers are seated directly opposite to each other, the
one on the anterior, the other on the posterior, wall of the stomach.The most plausible explanation of this is that the ulcers are caused by
a simultaneous affection of corresponding branches which are given off
symmetrically from the same arterial trunk as it runs along one of the
curvatures of the stomach (Virchow).[67]

[Footnote 67: A. Beer, "Aus dem path.R.
Virchow, etc.," _Wiener med.The ordinary size of the ulcer varies from a half inch to two inches in
diameter.The ulcer may be very minute, as in two cases reported by
Murchison, in each of which a pore-like hole was found leading into a
perforated artery from which fatal hemorrhage had occurred.[68] On the
other hand, the ulcer may attain an enormous size, extending sometimes
from the cardiac to the pyloric orifice and measuring five or six
inches in diameter.[69]

[Footnote 68: Murchison, _Trans.[Footnote 69: In one of Cruveilhier's cases the ulcer was 6-1/2 inches
long and 3-1/3 inches wide.Law describes an ulcer measuring 6 inches
by 3 inches (_Dublin Hosp.The ulcer is usually round or oval in shape.The outline of the ulcer
may become irregular by unequal extension in the periphery, or by the
coalescence of two or more ulcers, or by partial cicatrization.Simple
ulcers, especially when seated near the lesser curvature, have a
tendency to extend transversely to the long axis of the stomach, thus
following the course of the blood-vessels.By this mode of extension,
or more frequently by the coalescence of several ulcers, are formed
girdle ulcers, which more or less completely surround the circumference
of the stomach, oftener in the pyloric region than elsewhere.As the ulcer extends in depth it often destroys each successive layer
of the stomach in less extent than the preceding one, so that the form
of the ulcer is conical or funnel-shaped, with a terrace-like
appearance in its sloping edges.The apex of the truncated cone, which
is directed toward the peritoneum, is often not directly opposite to
the centre of the base or superior surface which occupies the mucous
membrane, so that one side of the cone may be vertical and the other
sloping.In the half of the stomach nearer the lesser curvature the
cone <DW72>s upward, and in the lower half of the stomach it <DW72>s
downward.The usual explanation of its conical shape is that the ulcer
exactly corresponds to the territory supplied by an artery with its
branches.Virchow finds an explanation for the oblique direction of the
funnel in the arrangement of the arteries of the stomach.These, coming
from different sources, run along the curvatures of the stomach, and
there give off symmetrically branches which run obliquely toward the
mucous membrane, so that one of these {505} branches with its
distributive twigs (arterial tree) would supply a part shaped like an
oblique funnel.One of the chief supports of the theory which refers
the origin of simple gastric ulcer to an arrest of the circulation is
this correspondence in shape of the ulcer to the area of distribution
of the branches of the arteries supplying the stomach.All ulcers do not present the conical form and terraced edges which
have been described.These appearances are far from constant in fresh
ulcers, and they are usually absent in those of long duration.The most characteristic anatomical feature of simple ulcer of the
stomach is the appearance of the edges and of the floor of the ulcer.The edges of recently-formed ulcers (acute ulcers) are clean-cut,
smooth, and not swollen.To use Rokitansky's well-known comparison, the
hole in the mucous coat looks as if it had been punched out by an
instrument.The floor of the ulcer may be smooth and firm or soft and
pulpy.The floor and edges of fresh ulcers are often infiltrated with
blood, but they may be of a pale-grayish color.Usually no granulations
and no pus are to be seen on the surface of the ulcer.[70] In ulcers of
longer duration the margins become thickened, indurated, and abrupt;
the floor acquires a dense fibrous structure.[Footnote 70: In rare instances granulations may be present, as in a
case of W. Muller's, in which their presence rendered difficult the
diagnosis of simple ulcer from carcinoma (_Jenaische Zeitschrift_, v.,
1870).The microscope may also be required to distinguish the
irregularly thickened margins of old ulcers from scirrhous cancer.]The floor of the ulcer may be the submucous, the muscular, or the
serous coat, or, if the whole thickness of the stomach be perforated,
it may be some adjacent organ to which the stomach has become adherent,
this organ being usually the pancreas or the left lobe of the liver or
neighboring lymphatic glands.The microscopic examination of recently-formed ulcers shows that the
tissue immediately surrounding the ulcer is composed of granular
material, disintegrated red blood-corpuscles, pale and swollen
fragments of connective-tissue fibres, and cells unaffected by
nuclear-staining dyes.The red blood-corpuscles are sometimes broken
into fragments of various sizes in about the same way as by the action
of heat.The gastric tubules are separated from each other and
compressed by infiltrated blood, and contain cells which do not stain.Around this margin of molecular disintegration, which has evidently
been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is often,
although not constantly, a zone of infiltration with small round cells,
probably emigrated white blood-corpuscles.These cells are most
abundant near the muscularis mucosae and in the submucosa.Extravasated
red blood-corpuscles extend a variable distance around the ulcer,
farthest as a rule in the submucous coat.Many of the blood-vessels in
the immediate neighborhood of the ulcer appear normal; others,
particularly the arterioles and the capillaries, may be filled with
hyaline thrombi.Clumps of hyaline material may also be seen in the
meshes of the tissue around the ulcer.Fine fatty granules may be seen
in the tissue near the ulcer.The interstices of the loose submucous
tissue and the lymphatic vessels are often filled with fibrillated
fibrin and scattered blood-corpuscles for a considerable distance
around the ulcer.In the margins of old gastric ulcers there is also a zone of molecular
necrosis.The induration and the thickening of the edges of these
ulcers {506} are caused by a new growth of fibrillated connective
tissue, which blends together all of the coats invaded by the ulcer.This new tissue is usually rich in lymphoid cells, which are often most
abundant in the lymphatic channels.In the fibrous edges and base of
old ulcers are arteries which are the seat of an obliterating
endarteritis, and which may be completely obliterated by this process.An interstitial neuritis may affect the nerve-trunks involved in the
fibrous growth.Blood-pigment may be present as an evidence of an old
hemorrhagic infiltration.[71]

[Footnote 71: The histological changes here described are based upon
the examination of typical specimens both of recent and of old gastric
ulcers which have come under my observation.]Cicatrization is accomplished by the development of fibrous tissue in
the floor and borders of the ulcer.By the contraction of this
new-formed tissue the edges of the mucous membrane are united to the
floor of the ulcer, and may be drawn together so as to close completely
the defect in the mucous membrane.The result is a white stellate
cicatrix, which is usually somewhat depressed and surrounded by
puckered mucous membrane.It is probable that small, superficial ulcers
may be closed so that the scar cannot be detected.The mucous membrane
which has been drawn over the cicatrix is intimately blended with the
fibrous substratum, and is usually itself invaded by fibrous tissue
which compresses and distorts the gastric tubules.Hauser[72] has shown
that the tubular glands grow down into the cicatricial tissue, where
they may branch in all directions.These new-formed tubules are lined
by clear cylindrical or cutical epithelial cells, and may undergo
cystic dilatation.Very irregular cicatrices may result from the
healing of large and irregular ulcers.When the ulcer is large and deep
and the stomach is adherent to surrounding parts, the edges of the
mucous membrane making the border of the ulcer cannot be united by the
contraction of the fibrous tissue in the floor of the ulcer.The
cicatrix of such ulcers consists of fibrous tissue uncovered by mucous
membrane.Such cicatrices are
liable to be the seat of renewed ulceration.[Footnote 72: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, Leipzig, 1883.In
the rare instances of carcinoma developing in the borders or in the
cicatrix of gastric ulcer, Hauser believes that the cancerous growth
starts from these glandular growths, which in general have only the
significance of Friedlander's atypical proliferation of epithelial
cells.]The formation and contraction of the cicatrix may cause various
deformities of the stomach.The character of these deformities depends
upon the situation, the size, and the depth of the ulcer which is
cicatrized.Among the most important of these distortions are stenosis
of the pyloric orifice, followed by dilatation of the stomach, more
rarely stenosis of the cardiac orifice, with contraction of the
stomach, approximation of the cardiac and of the pyloric orifices by
the healing of ulcers on the lesser curvature, and an hour-glass form
of the stomach, produced by the cicatrization of girdle ulcers or of a
series of ulcers extending around the stomach.These abnormalities in
form of the stomach, particularly the constriction of the orifices, may
be attended by more serious symptoms than the original ulcer.As the ulcer extends in depth a circumscribed peritonitis, resulting in
the formation of adhesions between the stomach and surrounding parts,
is usually excited before the serous coat is perforated, so that the
gravest of all possible accidents in the course of gastric
ulcer--namely, perforation {507} into the peritoneal sac--is
permanently or temporarily averted.It has been estimated that
adhesions form in about two-fifths of all cases of gastric ulcer
(Jaksch).On account of the usual position of the ulcer on the lesser
curvature or on the posterior wall of the stomach, the adhesions are
most frequently with the pancreas (in about one-half of all cases of
adhesion); next in frequency with the left lobe of the liver; rarely
with other parts, such as the lymphatic glands, the diaphragm, the
spleen, the kidney, the suprarenal capsule, the omentum, the colon, and
other parts of the intestine, the gall-bladder, the sternum, and the
anterior abdominal wall.Adhesions cannot readily form between the
anterior surface of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall, on
account of the constant movement of these parts, so that ulcers of the
anterior gastric wall are those most liable to perforate into the
peritoneal cavity.It is difficult to include in any description all of the various and
complicated lesions which may result from perforation by gastric ulcer
of all of the coats of the stomach.The consequences of perforation may
be conveniently classified as follows:

1.Some solid organ, usually the pancreas, the liver, or the lymphatic
glands, may close the hole in the stomach.An intra-peritoneal sac shut in by adhesions may communicate through
the ulcer with the cavity of the stomach.A fistulous communication may form either between the stomach and
the exterior (external gastric fistula) or between the stomach and some
hollow viscus (internal gastric fistula).The ulcer may perforate into the general peritoneal cavity.These lesions may be variously combined with each other.It is to be
noted that in the first three varieties protective adhesions are
present, and that in the last these adhesions are either absent or
ruptured.When the pancreas, the liver, or the spleen form the floor of the
ulcer, they may be protected from extension of the ulcerative process
by a new growth of fibrous tissue extending from the floor of the ulcer
a variable depth into these organs.Sometimes, however, the ulcerative
process, aided doubtless by the corroding action of the gastric juice,
eats out large excavations in these organs.These excavations
communicate with the cavity of the stomach, and are usually filled with
ichorous pus.The pancreas, unlike the spleen and the liver, possesses
comparative immunity against this invasion by the ulcerative process.The situation, the form, and the extent of circumscribed peritoneal
abscesses resulting from perforation of gastric ulcer depend upon the
parts with which the stomach has contracted adhesions.Should an ulcer
on the posterior wall of the stomach perforate before the formation of
adhesions, the perforation would of course be directly into the lesser
peritoneal cavity.An interesting example of this rare occurrence has
been communicated by Chiari.[73] In this case, the foramen of Winslow
being closed by adhesions, the lesser peritoneal cavity which
communicated with a gastric ulcer was filled with ichorous pus, and in
this floated the pancreas, which had necrosed in mass and had separated
as a sequestrum.That form of intra-peritoneal abscess known as
subphrenic pneumo-pyothorax has been already described under
Symptomatology.Peritoneal abscesses communicating with the stomach may
open into various places, {508} as into the general peritoneal cavity,
into the pleural cavity, into the retro-peritoneal tissue, through the
abdominal or thoracic walls, etc.Wochenschr._, 1876, No.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are a rare result of the perforation of
gastric ulcer.[74] The external opening is most frequently in the
umbilical region, but it may be in the epigastric or in the left
hypochondriac region or between the ribs.Fistulous communications
resulting from the perforation of gastric ulcer have been formed
between the stomach and one or more of the following hollow viscera or
cavities: the colon, the duodenum and other parts of the small
intestine, the gall-bladder, the common bile-duct, the pancreatic duct,
the pleura, the lung, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the left
ventricle.Gastro-colic fistulae, in contrast to gastro-cutaneous
fistulae, are more frequently produced by cancer than by ulcer of the
stomach.[75] In rare instances the peritoneum over ulcers of the lesser
curvature has contracted adhesions with the pyloric portion of the
stomach or with the first part of the duodenum.To accomplish this it
is necessary that a sharp bend in the lesser curvature should take
place.By extension of the ulcerative process abnormal communication is
established between the left and the right half of the stomach or
between the stomach and the duodenum.In either case the right half of
the stomach is often converted into a large blind diverticulum, the
digested food passing through the abnormal opening.[76] Gastro-duodenal
fistulae are more frequently with the third than with the first part of
the duodenum.In one of Starcke's cases the stomach communicated with
the colon and through the medium of a subphrenic abscess with the left
lung.[77]

[Footnote 74: Of the 25 cases of gastro-cutaneous fistula collected by
Murchison, 18 were the result of disease.In 12 of these cases the
probable cause was simple gastric ulcer (_Med.-Chir.Middeldorpf says that among the internal causes
of the 47 cases of external gastric fistula which he tabulated, simple
ulcer of the stomach played an important role (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1860).][Footnote 75: Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were from gastric cancer and 9 or 10 probably from simple
ulcer.On the other hand, gastro-cutaneous fistulae are twice as
frequently the result of simple ulcer as of cancer (_Edinb.[Footnote 76: Thierfelder has made the best study of the complicated
relations existing in these cases (_Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 77: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, No.Habershon also reports a
case in which a subphrenic abscess communicated with the lung, the
stomach, and the colon, but he believes that the ulceration was primary
in the colon (_Guy's Hosp.Four cases of perforation of gastric ulcer into the pericardium,[78]
with the production of pneumo-pericardium, have been reported, and two
cases of perforation into the left ventricle.[79] Muller found
lumbricoid worms in a pleural cavity which had been perforated by
gastric ulcer.[80] Diaphragmatic hernia may result from perforation of
the pleural cavity by gastric ulcer.[81] In one instance the greater
part of the small intestines {509} passed through a hole in the
transverse meso-colon which had been caused by a gastric ulcer.[Footnote 78: Hallin, _Schmidt's Jahrb._, cxix.37; Saxinger,
_Prager med.Wochenschr._, 1865; Guttmann, _Berl.Wochenschr._,
1880, No.Murchison mentions a specimen in the museum of King's
College, London, of a simple gastric ulcer opening into the pericardium
(_Edinb.In a case reported by Graves a
liver abscess burst into the stomach and into the pericardium (_Clin.[Footnote 79: Oser, _Wiener med.52; Brenner,
_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1881, No.[Footnote 80: Muller, _Memorabilien_, xvii., Oct., 1872.][Footnote 81: Needon, _Wiener med.In a case of
Gunsburg's the hole in the diaphragm was as large as the hand, and the
left pleural cavity contained the upper half of the stomach and the
spleen (_Arch.The various fistulae which have been mentioned may be either direct or
through the medium of an abscess.While some of them are only
pathological curiosities, others, particularly the communications of
the stomach with the pleural cavity and with the lung, are sufficiently
frequent to be of practical clinical interest.As has already been explained, ulcers of the anterior wall are the ones
most liable to perforate into the general peritoneal cavity,[82] but on
account of their comparative infrequency perforation occurs oftener in
other situations, particularly in the lesser curvature and near the
pylorus.Except on the anterior wall the perforation is often brought
about by the rupture of adhesions which for a time had prevented this
accident.In a considerable number of cases, particularly of ulcers on
the anterior wall, the ulcer looks as if recently formed (acute
perforating ulcer); in other cases its thickened and indurated margins
indicate long duration.Chiari[83] describes a case in which rupture
into the peritoneal cavity took place through the cicatrix of an old
ulcer, probably in consequence of the distension of the stomach with
gas.The hole in the peritoneum is usually circular, smaller than the
inner surface of the ulcer, and has sharp, well-defined edges.Less
frequently the edges are ragged.Post-mortem digestion may, however, so
change the borders of the opening as to make it difficult or impossible
to tell from their post-mortem appearances alone whether perforation
has occurred before or after death.The peritoneal cavity after death
from perforation is found to contain gas and substances from the
stomach.Usually within a few hours after perforation septic
peritonitis is excited, but in exceptional cases no inflammation of the
peritoneum has occurred even when life has been prolonged twenty-four
hours after perforation.[Footnote 82: According to Brinton, "the proportion of perforations to
ulcers is such that of every 100 ulcers in each of the following
situations, the numbers which perforate are--on the posterior surface,
about 2; the pyloric sac, 10; the middle of the organ, 13; the lesser
curvature, 18; the anterior and posterior surface at once, 28; the
cardiac extremity, 40; and the anterior surface, 85."]Emphysema of the subcutaneous, subperitoneal, and other loose areolar
tissue of the body is a rare but remarkable result of the perforation
of gastric ulcer.The emphysema is sometimes observed shortly before
death, but it attains its maximum development after death, when it may
spread rapidly over the greater part of the body.The gas consists in
part of hydrogen, as it burns with a blue flame.It is generated, at
least in great part, by fermentation of the contents of the stomach.The gas may enter the subserous tissue at the edges of the ulcer and
thence spread, or, after perforation of the stomach, it may make its
way from the peritoneal cavity into the loose subserous connective
tissue through some place in the parietal peritoneum which has been
macerated, perhaps by the digestive action of the gastric juice.[84]

[Footnote 84: Roger (_Arch.de Med._, 1862) and Demarquay (_Essai
de Pneumatologie medicale_, Paris, 1866) deserve the credit of first
calling general attention to the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema
after rupture of the digestive tract.The following writers have each
reported a case of emphysema following the perforation of gastric
ulcers: Cruveilhier, _Anat.Path._, t. i. livr.783; Thierfelder, _Deutsches Arch.Med._,
iv., 1868, p.33; Newman, _The Lancet_, 1868, vol.728;
Poensgen, _Das subcutane Emphysem nach continuitatstrennungen des
Digestionstractus, etc._, Inaug.Diss., Strassburg, 1879, p.40;
Korach, _Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1880 p.275; {510} Jurgensen,
_Deutsches Arch.Doubtful cases
are reported by Lefevre, W. Mayer, and Burggraeve.The fullest
consideration of the subject is to be found in the dissertation of
Poensgen.]In two cases of sudden death from gastric ulcer Jurgensen found gas in
the veins and arteries of various parts of the body.He believes that
this gas, which certainly was not the result of putrefaction after
death, was derived from the stomach, and that it entered during life
the circulation through vessels exposed in the borders of the ulcer,
thus causing death.In one of the cases a profuse hemorrhage preceded
death, and in the other the ulcer had perforated into the peritoneal
cavity.[85]

[Footnote 85: Jurgensen does not consider whether this gas may not have
made its way into the blood-vessels after death in a manner similar to
its extension through the cellular tissue of the body in the cases of
emphysema just mentioned.In the case which he has reported in full
interstitial and subserous emphysema could be traced from the ulcer
("Luft im Blute," _Deutsches Arch.The source of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is from blood-vessels
either in the stomach itself or in the neighborhood of the stomach.Hemorrhages slight or of moderate severity occur from the capillaries
and small arteries and veins in the mucous and submucous coats.Sometimes profuse and even fatal hemorrhage comes from arteries or from
veins in the submucous coat, especially when these vessels are dilated.Quickly-fatal hemorrhages take place from the large vessels between the
muscular and the serous coats, particularly from the main trunks on the
curvatures.After the formation of adhesions, followed by the
perforation of all of the coats of the stomach, profuse bleeding may
proceed from the erosion of large vessels near the stomach, such as the
splenic, the hepatic, the pancreatico-duodenal arteries, the portal and
the splenic veins, and the mesenteric vessels.Bleeding may also occur
from vessels in the parenchyma of organs invaded by the ulcer.The most
common source of fatal hemorrhage is from the splenic artery, which
from its position is peculiarly exposed to invasion by ulcers of the
posterior wall of the stomach.The hemorrhage is usually arterial in
origin.It may come from miliary aneurisms of the gastric arteries or
from varicose veins in the wall of the stomach.As Cruveilhier has
pointed out, an ulcer may cicatrize except over one spot corresponding
to an artery from which fatal hemorrhage may occur.Ulcers which give
rise to large hemorrhages are usually chronic in their course.Those
seated on the middle of the anterior wall, although peculiarly liable
to perforate, are comparatively exempt from hemorrhage on account of
the small size of the blood-vessels there.Changes in the blood-vessels of the stomach have been seen in a
considerable number of cases of gastric ulcer.Instances have been
recorded of the association with gastric ulcer of most of the diseases
to which blood-vessels are subject.An example in all respects
convincing of embolism of the artery supplying the ulcerated region of
the stomach has not been published.Probably the best case belonging
here is one of perforating ulcer of the stomach with hemorrhagic
infiltration in its walls, presented by Janeway to the New York
Pathological Society in 1871.[86] In this case there was in the
gastro-epiploic artery an ante-mortem fibrinous plug which was
continued into the nutrient artery of the ulcerated piece of the
stomach.No source for an embolus could be found.In one case Merkel
found an embolus in a small artery leading to an ulcer {511} of the
duodenum.[87] The arch of the aorta was atheromatous and contained a
thrombus.Patches of hemorrhagic infiltration existed in the stomach.In many cases thrombosis of the arteries, and especially of the veins
involved in the diseased tissue around an ulcer, has been observed, and
in some the thrombus was prolonged in the vessels for a considerable
distance from the ulcer.It is probable that in most of these cases the
thrombus was secondary to the ulcer.Hyaline thrombosis of the
capillaries near the ulcer is also to be mentioned.In a certain, but not large, number of cases atheroma with
calcification or with fatty degeneration of the arteries of the stomach
has been found associated with gastric ulcer.[88] Reference has already
been made to the occurrence of obliterating endarteritis in the
thickened edges and floor of gastric ulcer, where it is doubtless
secondary.In one case of gastric ulcer I found a widespread
obliterating endarteritis affecting small and medium-sized arteries in
many parts of the body, including the stomach.[89]

[Footnote 88: For cases in point see Norman Moore, _Trans.[Footnote 89: On the posterior wall of the stomach, midway between the
greater and the lesser curvature and five inches to the right of the
cardiac orifice, was a round ulcer half an inch in diameter, with
smooth, sharp edges.In the floor of the ulcer, which extended to the
muscular coat, was a small perforated aneurism of a branch of the
coronary artery.In addition there were small, granular kidneys,
hypertrophied heart without valvular lesion, and chronic interstitial
splenitis.Small and medium-sized arteries in the kidneys, spleen,
heart, lymphatic glands, and stomach were the seat of a typical
endarteritis obliterans, resulting in some instances in complete
closure of the lumen of the vessel.The patient, who was attended by
Sassdorf, was seized during the night with vomiting of blood, which
continued at intervals for twenty-four hours until his death.The
patient was a man about fifty years of age, without previous history of
gastric ulcer or of syphilis.]In one case Powell[90] found a small aneurism of the coronary artery in
an ulcer of the lesser curvature of the stomach.Hauser[91] found an
aneurismal dilatation of an atheromatous and thrombosed arterial twig
in the floor of a recent ulcer.In my case of obliterating endarteritis
just referred to there was a small aneurism in the floor of the ulcer.These miliary aneurisms in the floor of gastric ulcers seem to be
analogous to those in the walls of phthisical cavities.Miliary
aneurisms occur in the stomach independently of gastric ulcer, and may
give rise to fatal haematemesis, as in four cases reported by
Galliard.[92]

[Footnote 90: _Trans.[Footnote 91: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, p.11, Leipzig,
1883.][Footnote 92: _L'Union med._, Feb.Curtis reported a case of
fatal haematemesis from an aneurism, not larger than a small pea,
seated in the cicatrix of an old ulcer (_Med.Annals of Albany_, Aug.,
1880).]Gastric ulcer is occasionally associated with waxy degeneration of the
arteries of the stomach.[93] In most of these cases there were multiple
shallow ulcers.Haematemesis is generally absent in gastric ulcer
resulting from waxy disease of the gastric blood-vessels.As is well
known, the amyloid material itself resists the action of the gastric
juice.cit._) alludes to a case in which, with waxy
degeneration of the stomach, over one hundred small ulcers were found
in different stages of development, from hemorrhagic infiltrations to
complete ulcers.Cases belonging here are reported by Fehr, _Ueber die
Amyloide Degeneration_, Inaug.Diss., Bern, 1866; Merkel, _Wiener med.Presse_, 1869; Edinger, _Deutsches Arch.568; Marchiafava, _Atti del Accad.114; and
Mattei, _Deutsche med.Zeitung_, July 5, 1883.]Finally, varicosities of the veins of the stomach have been once in a
{512} while found with gastric ulcer.In a large number, probably in
the majority, of cases of gastric ulcer no changes have been found in
the blood-vessels of the stomach except such as were manifestly
secondary to the ulcer.That gastric ulcer is frequently complicated with chronic catarrhal
gastritis has been repeatedly mentioned in the course of this article.PATHOGENESIS.--Without doubt, the most obscure chapter in the history
of gastric ulcer is that relating to its origin and to its persistence.Notwithstanding a vast amount of investigation and of discussion,
unanimity of opinion upon these subjects has not been reached.In view
of this uncertainty it is desirable in this article to do little more
than to summarize the leading theories as to the development of gastric
ulcer.Most observers are agreed that the digestive action of the gastric
juice has some share in the development and the progress of the ulcer,
but as to the first cause of the ulcer there are various hypotheses.The earliest theory refers the origin of simple ulcer of the stomach to
inflammation.Since its advocacy by Abercrombie and by Cruveilhier this
theory has always had its adherents, particularly among French writers.It is true that in stomachs which are the seat of simple ulcer
evidences of inflammation can often be found both in the neighborhood
of the ulcer and elsewhere.In recent times the supporters of the
inflammatory origin of gastric ulcer lay especial stress upon the
presence of foci of infiltration with small round cells in the mucous
and the submucous coats.[94] But it is difficult to explain by the
inflammatory theory the usually solitary occurrence and the funnel-like
shape of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 94: Laveran, _Arch.443;
Galliard, _Essai sur la Pathogenie de l'Ulcere simple de l'Estomac_,
These de Paris, 1882; Colombo, _Annali univ.The theory that gastric ulcer is of neurotic origin has also been
advocated.Some refer the origin to the secretion of an excessively
acid gastric juice under abnormal nervous influence (Gunsburg), others
to vaso-motor disturbances, and others to trophic disturbances.Wilks
and Moxon compare simple gastric ulcer to ulcers of the cornea
resulting from paralysis of the trigeminus.The neurotic theory of the
origin of gastric ulcer is altogether speculative and has never gained
wide acceptance.[95]

[Footnote 95: The first to attribute gastric ulcer to nervous influence
was Siebert (_Casper's Wochenschr.f. d. Heilk._, 1842, No.29, and
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1852).Heilk._,
xi., 1852; Wilks and Moxon, _Lect.Anat._, 2d ed., Philada.,
1875, p.Osborne in 1845 attributed gastric ulcer to the secretion
of an abnormally acid juice by a circular group of the gastric glands
(_Dublin Journ.The view which has met with the greatest favor is that which attributes
the origin of gastric ulcer to impairment or arrest of the circulation
in a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach, and to a subsequent
solution by the gastric juice of the part thus affected.Rokitansky
first suggested this view by assigning hemorrhagic necrosis of the
mucous membrane as the first step in the formation of the ulcer; but it
is Virchow who has most fully developed this view and has given it its
main support.The first cause of gastric ulcer, according to Virchow,
is a hemorrhagic infiltration of the coats of the stomach induced by
local disturbances in the circulation.The part the nutrition of which
is thus impaired or destroyed is dissolved by the gastric juice.{513} The affections of the gastric blood-vessels to which importance
has been attached are (_a_) embolism and thrombosis; (_b_) diseases of
the coats of the vessels, as atheroma, obliterating endarteritis, fatty
degeneration, amyloid degeneration, and aneurismal and varicose
dilatations; (_c_) compression of the veins by spasm of the muscular
coats of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgia; (_d_) passive
congestion of the stomach by obstruction in the portal circulation.In support of this view are urged the following facts: First, it has
been proven by the experiments of Pavy that parts of the gastric wall
from which the circulation has been shut off undergo digestion; second,
hemorrhagic infarctions have been observed in the stomach, both alone
(Von Recklinghausen, Hedenius) and associated with gastric ulcer (Key,
Rindfleisch); third, the hemorrhagic infiltration in the walls of
recently-formed ulcers indicates a hemorrhagic origin; fourth, the
funnel-like shape of the ulcer resembles the funnel-shaped area of
distribution of an artery; fifth, gastric ulcers have been
experimentally produced by injecting emboli into the gastric arteries
(Panum, Cohnheim).[96]

[Footnote 96: Pavy, _Philosoph.161; V.
Recklinghausen, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.368; Axel Key, _Virchow
und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1870, Bd.155; Rindfleisch, _Lehrb.Gewebelehre_, 5te Aufl., Leipzig, 1878; Panum, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.491; Cohnheim, _Vorles.The main objections to this view are the infrequency with which the
assumed changes in the blood-vessels have been demonstrated, the common
occurrence of gastric ulcer at an age earlier than that at which
diseases of the blood-vessels are usually present, and the absence of
gastric ulcer in the vast majority of cases of heart disease, with
widespread embolism of different organs of the body.To meet some of
these objections, Klebs[97] presupposes in many cases a local spasmodic
contraction of the gastric arteries, causing temporary interruption of
the circulation; Rindfleisch and Axel Key, compression of the gastric
veins, with resulting hemorrhagic infiltration by spasm of the muscular
coat of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgic attacks.What is actually known concerning diseases of the gastric blood-vessels
in ulcer of the stomach has already been stated under the morbid
anatomy.From this it may be inferred that the origin of gastric ulcer
in diseased conditions of the blood-vessels has been established only
for a comparatively small group of cases.Bottcher's[98] view that gastric ulcer is of mycotic origin, being
produced by micrococci, has thus far met with no confirmation.[Footnote 98: _Dorpater med.There are those who hold an eclectic view concerning the origin of
gastric ulcer.They believe that ulcer of the stomach may be produced
by a variety of causes, such as inflammation, circulatory disturbances,
irritating substances introduced into the stomach, traumatism, etc.The
peculiarities of the ulcer are due not to any specific cause, but to
the solvent action of the gastric juice, which keeps clean the floor
and the sides of the ulcer.These clean edges and floor, which are
incident to all ulcers of the stomach, justify no conclusion as to the
cause of the ulcer.Engel[99] over thirty years ago held that gastric
ulcer might {514} originate in various ways--that there was nothing
specific about it.[Footnote 99: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, 1853, ii.]Gastric ulcers have been produced experimentally in animals in a
variety of ways, but these experiments have not materially elucidated
the pathenogenesis of ulcer in man.Schiff by lesions of various parts
of the brain, and later Ebstein by lesions of many parts of the central
and peripheral nervous system by injections of strychnine--in fact,
apparently by any means which greatly increased the
blood-pressure--produced in the stomachs of animals ecchymoses and
ulcers.Muller by ligation of the portal vein, Pavy by ligation of
arteries supplying the stomach, likewise produced hemorrhages and
ulcers.The results of Pavy could not be confirmed by Roth and others.Panum, and afterward Cohnheim, produced gastric ulcers by introducing
multiple emboli into the gastric arteries.Daettwyler under Quincke's
direction caused, in dogs with gastric fistulae, ulcers of the stomach
by various mechanical, chemical, and thermic irritants applied to the
inner surface of the stomach.Aufrecht observed hemorrhages and ulcers
in the stomachs of rabbits after subcutaneous injections of
cantharidin.[100]

_Centralbl.The most interesting of these experiments are those of Cohnheim and of
Daettwyler, who demonstrated that in one essential point all of these
experimental ulcers differ from simple gastric ulcer in man--namely, in
the readiness with which they heal.To this ready healing the gastric
juice, much as it has been accused of causing the spread of gastric
ulcers in man, seems to have offered no obstacle.We know that similar
losses of substance in the human stomach heal equally well.[101] Hence
it has been maintained throughout this article that it is unjustifiable
to regard all of the scars found in the human stomach as the result of
simple ulcer.[Footnote 101: Portions of the mucous membrane of the stomach,
sometimes with some of the submucous coat, have been in several
instances removed with the stomach-pump, but thus far no bad effects
have followed.]It appears from these experiments, as well as from observations on man,
that it is more difficult to explain why ulcers in the stomach do not
heal than it is to understand how they may be produced.From this point
of view the observation of Daettwyler is of interest, that in dogs
which had been rendered anaemic by repeated abstraction of blood not
only did slighter irritants suffice to produce ulcers of the stomach,
but the ulcers healed much more slowly.Practically, it is important to
learn what are the obstacles to the repair of gastric ulcers, but our
positive knowledge of these is slight.It is probable that such
obstacles are to be found in constitutional causes, such as anaemia and
chlorosis, in abnormal states of the blood-vessels around the ulcer, in
catarrhal affections of the stomach, in irritating articles of food, in
improper modes of living, and in increased acidity of the gastric
juice.DIAGNOSIS.--In many cases the diagnosis of gastric ulcer can be made
with reasonable certainty; in other cases the diagnosis amounts only to
a suspicion more or less strong, and in still other cases the diagnosis
is impossible.{515} The diagnostic symptoms are epigastric pain, vomiting, and
gastric hemorrhage.The characteristics of the pain which aid in the
diagnosis are its fixation in one spot in the epigastric region, its
onset soon after eating, its dependence upon the quantity and the
quality of the food, its relief upon the complete expulsion of the
contents of the stomach, its alleviation by changes in posture, and its
increase by pressure.That the pain of gastric ulcer has not always
these characteristics has been mentioned under the Symptomatology.Vomiting without haematemesis is the least characteristic of these
symptoms.It aids in the diagnosis when it occurs after eating at the
acme of a gastralgic attack and is followed by the relief of pain.Haematemesis is the most valuable symptom in diagnosis.The more
profuse the hemorrhage and the younger the individual in whom it
occurs, the greater is the probability of gastric ulcer.It should not
be forgotten that the blood is sometimes discharged solely by the
stools.The simultaneous occurrence of all these symptoms renders the diagnosis
of gastric ulcer easy.[102] In all cases in which gastrorrhagia is
absent the diagnosis is uncertain; but gastric ulcer should be
suspected whenever the ingestion of food is followed persistently by
severe epigastric pain and other causes of the pain have not been
positively determined.When the course of the ulcer is latent and when
the symptoms are only those of dyspepsia, the diagnosis is of course
impossible.In cases previously obscure a diagnosis in extremis is
sometimes made possible by the occurrence of perforation of the
stomach.[Footnote 102: That even under the most favorable circumstances
absolute certainty in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not reached is
illustrated by a case reported with great precision and fulness by
Banti: A female servant, twenty-one years old, had every symptom of
gastric ulcer, including repeated haematemesis and the characteristic
epigastric pain.She died from an
ulcerative proctitis four days after the last hemorrhage from the
stomach.Only a slight catarrhal inflammation of the stomach was found
at the autopsy, without trace of ulcer, cicatrix, or ecchymosis ("Di un
Caso d'Ematemesi," _La Sperimentale_, Feb., 1880, p.It would
seem as if there must have been an ulcer which had healed so completely
as to leave no recognizable scar.]In making a differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer, as well as of any
disease, reliance should be placed more upon the whole complexion of
the case than upon any fancied pathognomonic symptoms.The diseases which are most difficult to distinguish from gastric ulcer
are nervous affections of the stomach.Like gastric ulcer, most of
these are more common in women than in men, and especially in chlorotic
women with disordered menstruation and with hysterical manifestations.These nervous affections are manifold and their leading characteristics
are not yet well defined.The most important of these affections are
nervous dyspepsia, nervous vomiting, nervous gastralgia, and gastric
crises.The leading symptoms of nervous dyspepsia, as described by Leube,[103]
are the ordinary symptoms of dyspepsia without evidence of anatomical
alteration of the stomach, and with the proof by washing out the
stomach that the process of digestion is not delayed.Nervous dyspepsia
is often associated with other nervous affections, and is caused
especially by influences which depress the nervous system.Epigastric
pain, and especially tenderness on pressure over the stomach, are not
common symptoms in nervous dyspepsia.Only those rare cases of gastric
ulcer in which hemorrhage from the stomach is absent and epigastric
pain is not prominent {516} are likely to be confounded with nervous
dyspepsia.In such cases, although the diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia
is by far the most probable, the patient may be confined to bed and put
upon the strict regimen for gastric ulcer.If in the course of ten days
or two weeks essential relief is not obtained, ulcer may be excluded,
and the proper treatment for nervous dyspepsia with tonics and
electricity may be adopted (Leube).[Footnote 103: _Deutches Arch.In nervous vomiting, which occurs most frequently in hysterical women,
other nervous manifestations are present; there are usually less
epigastric pain and tenderness than in ulcer; the nutrition is better
preserved; the vomiting is less dependent upon the ingestion of food
and more dependent on mental states; and there are longer intervals of
relief than in ulcer.Still, it may be necessary to resort to the
therapeutical diagnosis as in the preceding instance.In this connection attention may be called to the importance of
searching for reflex causes of vomiting, such as beginning phthisis,
ovarian or uterine disease, cerebral disease, and pregnancy; also to
certain cases of chronic Bright's disease in which gastric disturbances
are the main symptoms.Of all the nervous affections of the stomach, nervous gastralgia is the
one which presents the greatest similarity to gastric ulcer.Its
diagnosis from gastric ulcer is often extremely difficult, and may be
impossible.The points of difference given in the following table may
aid in the diagnosis:

elevated in gastric ulcer, but not in nervous gastralgia.Probably not a single one of the points mentioned in the table is
without exception.Nervous gastralgia may be associated with gastric
ulcer, and if the ulcer is otherwise latent the diagnosis is manifestly
impossible.A diagnosis of purely functional gastralgia has been
repeatedly overthrown by the occurrence of profuse haematemesis.There
is no symptom {517} upon which it is more unsatisfactory to base a
diagnosis than upon pain.There is much difference among physicians as
regards the frequency with which they diagnose gastric ulcer in the
class of cases here described.It is probable that the error is
oftenest a too frequent diagnosis of gastric ulcer than the reverse.Nevertheless, when there is doubt it is well to submit the patient for
a time to the proper treatment for gastric ulcer.In several instances gastric crises have been mistaken for gastric
ulcer.These gastric or gastralgic crises, as they are called by
Charcot, by whom they have been best described,[105] are most
frequently associated with locomotor ataxia, but they may occur in
connection with other diseases of the spinal cord (subacute myelitis,
general spinal paralysis, and disseminated sclerosis), and an analogous
affection has been described by Leyden[106] as an independent disease
under the name of periodical vomiting with severe gastralgic attacks.Gastric crises have been most carefully studied as a symptom in the
prodromic stage of locomotor ataxia.The distinguishing features of
these crises are the sudden onset and the atrocious severity of the
gastric pain; the simultaneous occurrence of almost incessant vomiting;
the habitual continuance of the paroxysms, almost without remission,
for two or three days; the normal performance of the gastric functions
in the intervals between the paroxysms, which may be months apart; the
frequent association with other prodromic symptoms of locomotor ataxia,
such as ocular disorders and fulgurating pains in the extremities; and
the development after a time of ataxia.Leyden has observed during the
attacks retraction of the abdomen without tension of the abdominal
walls, obstinate constipation, scanty, dark- urine, even anuria
for twenty-four hours, and increased frequency of the pulse (also noted
by Charcot).Vulpian[107] mentions a case in which there was vomiting
of dark- blood, and in which naturally the diagnosis of gastric
ulcer had been made.In the autopsies of Leyden and of Charcot no
lesions of the stomach have been found.[Footnote 107: _Maladies du Syst.The differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer from gastric cancer will be
considered in the article on GASTRIC CANCER.It has already been said that a part of the symptoms of gastric ulcer
are due to an associated chronic catarrhal gastritis.Usually other
symptoms are present which render possible the diagnosis of the ulcer.There is usually some apparent external or internal cause of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, whereas the etiology of ulcer is obscure; in
chronic gastritis gastralgic paroxysms and the peculiar fixed
epigastric pain of gastric ulcer are usually absent; in chronic
gastritis profuse haematemesis is a rare occurrence; and in gastritis
the relief obtained by rest and proper regulation of the diet, although
manifest, is usually less immediate and striking than in most cases of
gastric ulcer.The passage of gall-stones is usually sufficiently distinguished from
gastric ulcer by the sudden onset and the sudden termination of the
pain, by the situation of the pain to the right of the median line, by
the complete relief in the intervals between the attacks, by the
occurrence of jaundice, by the recognition sometimes of enlargement of
the liver and of the gall-bladder, and by the detection of gall-stones
in the feces.{518} There is not much danger of confounding abdominal aneurism and
lead colic with gastric ulcer, and the points in their differential
diagnosis are sufficiently apparent to require no description here.The
diagnosis of duodenal ulcer from gastric ulcer will be discussed
elsewhere.The different causes of gastric hemorrhage, a knowledge of
which is essential to the diagnosis of gastric ulcer, will be
considered in the article on HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.PROGNOSIS.--Although a decided majority of simple ulcers of the stomach
cicatrize, nevertheless, in view of the frequently insidious course of
the disease, the sudden perforations, the grave hemorrhages, the
relapses, and the sequels of the disease, the prognosis must be
pronounced serious.The earlier the ulcer comes under treatment the better the prognosis.Old ulcers with thickened indurated margins containing altered
blood-vessels naturally heal with greater difficulty than
recently-formed ulcers.Profuse hemorrhage adds to the gravity of the diagnosis.It usually
indicates that the ulcer has penetrated to the serous coat of the
stomach.A hemorrhage may exert a favorable influence, in so far as to
convince the patient of the necessity of submitting to the repose and
the strict dietetic regimen which the physician prescribes.The severity of the pain is of little value as a prognostic sign.Vomiting and dyspepsia, if uncontrolled by regulation of the diet, lead
to a cachectic state which often ends in death.Little basis as there is to hope for recovery after perforation into
the general peritoneal cavity, there nevertheless have been a very few
cases in which there is reason to believe that recovery has actually
taken place after this occurrence.[108]

[Footnote 108: The most convincing case of recovery after perforation
of gastric ulcer is one reported by Hughes, Ray, and Hilton in _Guy's
Hosp.A servant-girl was suddenly seized with all
of the symptoms of perforation.Fortunately, she had eaten nothing for
four hours before the attack, and then only gruel.She was placed at
once under the influence of opium, was kept in the recumbent posture,
and was fed by the rectum.She was discharged apparently cured after
fifty-two days.Two months afterward she was again suddenly seized with
the same symptoms, and she died in fourteen hours.Shortly before the
second perforation she had eaten cherries, strawberries, and
gooseberries, which were found in the peritoneal cavity.The autopsy
showed, in addition to a recent peritonitis, evidences of an old
peritonitis.There were adhesions of the coils of the intestines with
each other and between the stomach and adjacent viscera.In the stomach
were found a cicatrix and two open ulcers, one of which had perforated.Other cases in which recovery followed after all of the symptoms of
perforation of gastric ulcer were present, but in which no subsequent
autopsy proved the correctness of the diagnosis, have been reported by
Redwood (_Lancet_, May 7, 1870); Ross (_ibid._, Jan.21, 1871); Tinley
(_ibid._, April 15, 1871); Mancini (_La Sperimentale_, 1876, pp.551,
665); and G. Johnson (_Brit.Frazer's two cases, reported in the _Dublin Hosp.Gaz._, April 15,
1861, are not convincing.The case reported by Aufrecht (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.21) and the one by Starcke (_Deutsche Klinik_,
1870, No.39), which are sometimes quoted as examples of recovery, were
cases of circumscribed peritonitis following perforation.In an interesting case from Nothnagel's clinic reported by Luderitz,
the patient lived sixteen days after perforation into the peritoneal
cavity, followed by all of the symptoms of diffuse perforative
peritonitis.Death resulted from pneumonia secondary to the
peritonitis.At the autopsy were found adhesions over the whole
peritoneal surface and streaks of thickened pus between the coils of
intestine.The perforation in the stomach was closed by the left lobe
of the liver (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1879, No.In estimating the prognosis one should bear in mind the possibility of
relapses; of a continuance of gastric disorders, particularly of
gastralgia, after cicatrization; of the formation of cicatricial
stenosis of {519} the orifices of the stomach; and of the development
of dilatation of the stomach.After the worst has been said concerning the unfavorable issues of
gastric ulcer, it yet remains true that the essential tendency of the
ulcer when placed under favorable conditions is toward recovery, and
that in many cases the treatment of the disease affords most excellent
results, and is therefore a thankful undertaking for the physician.TREATMENT.--In the absence of any agent which exerts a direct curative
influence upon gastric ulcer the main indication for treatment is the
removal of all sources of irritation from the ulcer, so that the
process of repair may be impeded as little as possible.Theoretically, this is best accomplished by giving to the stomach
complete rest and by nourishing the patient by rectal alimentation.Practically, this method of administering food is attended with many
difficulties, and, moreover, the nutrition of the patient eventually
suffers by persistence in its employment.In most cases the patient can
be more satisfactorily nourished by the stomach, and by proper
selection of the diet, without causing injurious irritation of the
ulcer.At the beginning of the course of treatment it is often well to
withhold for two or three days all food from the stomach and to resort
to exclusive rectal feeding.In some cases with uncontrollable vomiting
and after-hemorrhage from the stomach it is necessary to feed the
patient exclusively by the rectum.The substances best adapted for nutritive enemata are
artificially-digested foods, such as Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion,
his beef-solution, and peptonized milk-gruel as recommended by
Roberts.[109] Beef-tea and eggs, which are often used for this purpose,
are not to be recommended, as the former has very little nutritive
value, and egg albumen is absorbed in but slight amount from the
rectum.Expressed beef-juice may also be used for rectal alimentation.The peptones, although physiologically best adapted for nutritive
enemata, often irritate the mucous membrane of the rectum, so that they
cannot be retained.It has been proven that it is impossible to
completely nourish a human being by the rectum.[110] Rectal
alimentation can sometimes be advantageously combined with feeding by
the mouth.[Footnote 109: Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion is prepared by adding
to 4-8 ounces of scraped and finely-chopped beef l-2-1/2 ounces of
fresh finely-chopped oxen's or pig's pancreas freed from fat.To the
mixture is added a little lukewarm water until the consistence after
stirring is that of thick gruel.The syringe used to inject this
mixture should have a wide opening in the nozzle; Leube has constructed
one for the purpose (Leube, _Deutsches Arch.The milk-gruel is prepared by adding a thick, well-boiled gruel made
from wheaten flour, arrowroot, or some other farinaceous article to an
equal quantity of milk.Just before administration a dessertspoonful of
liquor pancreaticus (Benger) or 5 grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild Bros.), with 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda, are added to
the enema.This may be combined with peptonized beef-tea made according
to Roberts's formula (Roberts, _On the Digestive Ferments_, p.Preparatory to beginning the treatment the bowels should be emptied by
a clyster, and this should be occasionally repeated.About three to six
ounces of the tepid nutritive fluid should be slowly injected into the
rectum.The injections may be repeated at intervals of from three to
six hours.If necessary, a few drops of laudanum may be occasionally
added to the enema.][Footnote 110: Voit u. Bauer, _Zeitschrift f. Biologie_, Bd.There is universal agreement that the dietetic treatment of gastric
ulcer is of much greater importance than the medicinal treatment.There
is {520} hardly another disease in which the beneficial effects of
proper regulation of the diet are so apparent as in gastric ulcer.Those articles of food are most suitable which call into action least
vigorously the secretion of gastric juice and the peristaltic movements
of the stomach, which do not cause abnormal fermentations, which do not
remain a long time in the stomach, and which do not mechanically
irritate the surface of the ulcer.These requirements are met only by a
fluid diet, and are met most satisfactorily by milk and by Leube's
beef-solution.The efficacy of a milk diet in this disease has been attested by long
and manifold experience.By its adoption in many cases the pain and the
vomiting are relieved, and finally disappear, and the ulcer heals.In
general, fresh milk is well borne.If not, skimmed milk may be
employed.If the digestion of the milk causes acidity, then a small
quantity of bicarbonate of soda or some lime-water (one-fourth to
one-half in bulk) may be added to the milk.Large quantities should not
be taken at once.Four ounces of milk taken every two hours are
generally well borne.Sometimes not more than a tablespoonful can be
taken at a time without causing vomiting, and then of course the milk
should be given at shorter intervals.It is desirable that the patient
should receive at least a quart, and if possible two quarts, during the
twenty-four hours.The milk should be slightly warmed, but in some
cases cold milk may be better retained.In some instances buttermilk
agrees with the patient better than sweet milk.Although many suppose
that they have some idiosyncrasy as regards the digestion of milk, this
idiosyncrasy is more frequently imaginary than real.Still, there are
cases in which milk cannot be retained, even in small quantity.For such cases peptonized milk often proves serviceable.[111] The
artificial digestion of milk as well as of other articles of food is a
method generally applicable to the treatment of gastric ulcer.The main
objection to peptonized milk is the aversion to it that many patients
acquire on account of its bitter taste.The peptonization should not be
carried beyond a slightly bitter taste.The disagreeable taste may be
improved by the addition of a little Vichy or soda-water.Peptonized
milk has proved to be most valuable in the treatment of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 111: Milk may be peptonized by adding to a pint of fresh
milk, warmed to a temperature of 100 degrees F., 5 grs.of extract
pancreatis (Fairchild Bros.sodii
dissolved in 4 ounces of tepid water.The mixture is allowed to digest
for about an hour at a temperature of 100 degrees F., which may be
conveniently done by placing the milk in a bowl in a pan of water
maintained at this temperature.It is then boiled, strained, and placed
on ice, or when the milk is to be taken immediately it is better not to
boil it, in order that the partial digestion may continue for a while
under the influence of the pancreatic ferment in the stomach.The milk
without boiling may be kept on ice without further digestion; and this
procedure has the advantage that the pancreatic ferments, although
inactive at a temperature near that of ice, are not destroyed.The
degree of digestion aimed at is indicated by the production of a
slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter taste.When the digestion is
carried to completion, milk has a very bitter and disagreeable flavor.Peptonized milk-gruel, mentioned on page 519, may also be employed.]Leube's beef-solution[112] is a nutritious, unirritating, and
easily-digested article of diet.It can often be taken when milk is not
easily or {521} completely digested, or when milk becomes tiresome and
disagreeable to the patient.It is relied upon mainly by Leube in his
very successful treatment of gastric ulcer.A pot of the beef-solution
(corresponding to a half pound of beef) is to be taken during the
twenty-four hours.A tablespoonful or more may be given at a time in
unsalted or but slightly salted bouillon, to which, if desired, a
little of Liebig's beef-extract may be added to improve the taste.The
bouillon should be absolutely free from fat.Unfortunately, not a few
patients acquire such a distaste for the beef-solution that they cannot
be persuaded to continue its use for any considerable length of time.[Footnote 112: By means of a high temperature and of hydrochloric acid
the meat enclosed in an air-tight vessel is converted into a fine
emulsion and is partly digested.Its soft consistence, highly
nutritious quality, and easy digestibility render this preparation of
the greatest value.The beef-solution is prepared in New York
satisfactorily by Mettenheimer, druggist, Sixth Avenue and Forty-fifth
street, and by Dr.Rudisch, whose preparation is sold by several
druggists.]Freshly-expressed beef-juice is also a fairly nutritious food, which
can sometimes be employed with advantage.The juice is rendered more
palatable if it is pressed from scraped or finely-chopped beef which
has been slightly broiled with a little fresh butter and salt.The meat
should, however, remain very rare, and the fat should be carefully
removed from the juice.To the articles of diet which have been mentioned can sometimes be
added raw or soft-boiled egg in small quantity, and as an addition to
the milk crumbled biscuit or wheaten bread which may be toasted, or
possibly powdered rice or arrowroot or some of the infant farinaceous
foods, such as Nestle's.Milk thickened with powdered cracker does not
coagulate in large masses in the stomach, and is therefore sometimes
better borne than ordinary milk.For the first two or three weeks at least the patient should be
confined strictly to the bill of fare here given.Nothing should be
left to the discretion of the patient or of his friends.It is not enough to direct the patient simply to
take easily-digested food, but precise directions should be given as to
what kind of food is to be taken, how much is to be taken at a time,
how often it is to be taken, and how it is to be prepared.In all cases of any severity the patient should be treated in bed in
the recumbent posture, and warm fomentations should be kept over the
region of the stomach.Usually, at the end of two or three weeks of this diet the patient's
condition is sufficiently improved to allow greater variety in his
food.Boiled white meat of a young fowl can
now usually be taken, and agreeable dishes can be prepared with milk,
beaten eggs, and farinaceous substances, such as arrowroot, rice,
corn-starch, tapioca, and sago.Boiled calf's brain and calf's feet are allowed by Leube at this stage
of the treatment.To these articles can soon be added a very rare beefsteak made from the
soft mass scraped by a blunt instrument from a tenderloin of beef, so
that all coarse and tough fibres are left behind.This may be
superficially broiled with a little fresh butter.Boiled white fish,
particularly cod, may also be tried.It is especially important to avoid all coarse, mechanically-irritating
food, such as brown bread, wheaten grits, oatmeal, etc.; also fatty
substances, pastry, acids, highly-seasoned food, vegetables, fruit, and
all kinds of spirituous liquor.The juice of oranges and of lemons can
usually be taken.The food should not be taken very hot or very cold.For at least two or three months the patient should be confined to the
{522} easily-digested articles of diet mentioned.These afford
sufficient variety, and no license should be given to exceed the
dietary prescribed by the physician.Transgression in this respect is
liable to be severely punished by return of the symptoms.When there is
reason to believe that the ulcer is cicatrized, the patient may
gradually resume his usual diet, but often for a long time, and perhaps
for life, he may be compelled to guard his diet very carefully, lest
there should be a return of the disease.Should there be symptoms of a
relapse, the patient should resume at once the easily-digested diet
described above.Medicinal treatment of gastric ulcer, although less efficacious than
the dietetic treatment, is not to be discarded.Since its advocacy by
Ziemssen the administration of Carlsbad salts or of similarly composed
salts belongs to the systematic treatment of gastric ulcer.The objects
intended to be accomplished by the use of these salts are the daily
evacuation of the contents of the stomach into the intestine by gentle
stimulation of the gastric peristaltic movements, the neutralization of
the acid of the stomach, and the prevention of acid fermentations in
the stomach.Of these objects the most important is the prevention of
stagnation of the contents of the stomach.The chief ingredients of the
Carlsbad waters are sulphate of sodium, carbonate of sodium, and
chloride of sodium.The most important of these ingredients is sulphate
of sodium (Glauber's salts), which by exciting peristalsis propels the
gastric contents into the intestine, and thus relieves the stomach of
its burden, prevents fermentation, and removes from the surface of the
ulcer an important source of irritation.The carbonate of sodium
neutralizes the acids of the stomach, but the main value of this
ingredient and of the chloride of sodium is that in some way they
correct the action of the Glauber's salts, so that the latter may be
taken in smaller quantity and without the usual unpleasant effects of
pure Glauber's salts.[113] The artificial Carlsbad salts are to be
preferred to the natural or the artificial Carlsbad water.The natural
Carlsbad salts and much of those sold as artificial Carlsbad salts
consist almost wholly of sulphate of sodium.It is therefore best to
prescribe in proper proportion the leading ingredients of these salts.A suitable combination is sulphate of sodium five ounces, bicarbonate
of sodium two ounces, and chloride of sodium one ounce
(Leichtenstern[114]).The relative proportion of the ingredients may of
course be varied somewhat to suit individual cases.The salts are to be
taken daily before breakfast dissolved in a considerable quantity of
warm water.One or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the salts are dissolved
in one-half to one pint of water warmed to a {523} temperature of 95
degrees F. One-fourth of this is to be drunk at a time at intervals of
ten minutes.Breakfast is taken half an hour after the last draught.After breakfast there should follow one or two loose movements of the
bowels.If this is not the case, the next day the quantity of the salts
is to be increased, or if more movements are produced the quantity is
to be diminished until the desired result is obtained.In case the
salts do not operate, an enema may be used.Usually, to obtain the same
effect, the quantity of salts may be gradually diminished to a
teaspoonful.[Footnote 113: Water from the Sprudel spring contains in 16 ounces 18.2
grains of sulphate of sodium, 14.6 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
7.9 grains of chloride of sodium, and 11.8 cubic inches of carbonic
acid.Its natural temperature is 158 degrees F. The other Carlsbad
springs have the same fixed composition and vary only in temperature
and amount of CO_{2}.][Footnote 114: The second edition of the German Pharmacopoeia contains
a formula for making artificial Carlsbad salts, so that the ingredients
are in about the same proportion as in the natural water.The formula
is as follows: Dried sulphate of sodium 44 parts, sulphate of potassium
2 parts, chloride of sodium 18 parts, bicarbonate of sodium 36 parts.These should be mixed so as to make a white dry powder.The Carlsbad
water is imitated by dissolving 6 grammes of this salt in 1 liter of
water (_Pharmacopoeia Germanica_, editio altera, Berlin, 1882, p.According to a prescription very commonly used in Germany, the Carlsbad
salts are made by taking sulphate of sodium 50 parts, bicarbonate of
sodium 6 parts, chloride of sodium 3 parts.Dose, a teaspoonful
dissolved in one or two tumblers of warm water (Ewald u. Ludecke,
_Handb.Arzneiverordnungslehre_, Berlin, 1883, p.The Carlsbad salts are directed especially against the chronic gastric
catarrh which complicates the majority of cases of ulcer of the
stomach.It is well known that the most effective method of treating
this morbid condition is the washing out of the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube.The propriety of adopting this procedure in gastric ulcer
comes, therefore, under consideration.Although the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric ulcer is discarded by Leube and by See on
account of its possible danger, nevertheless this instrument has been
employed with great benefit in many instances of this disease by
Schliep, Debore, and others.[115] No instance of perforation of an
ulcer by means of the stomach-tube has been reported, and in general no
evil effects have resulted; but Duguet cites a case of fatal hemorrhage
following washing out of the stomach.[116] In view of the great benefit
to be secured by washing out the stomach, and of the comparatively
slight danger which attends the process, it seems justifiable to adopt
this procedure cautiously and occasionally in cases of gastric ulcer
with severe gastric catarrh.Of course only the soft rubber tube should
be used, and the siphon process should be adopted.[117] The stomach may
be washed out with pure warm water or with water containing a little
bicarbonate of sodium (one-half drachm to a quart of water).The
occasional cleansing of the stomach in this way can hardly fail to
promote the healing of the ulcer.Recent or threatened hemorrhage from
the stomach would contraindicate the use of the stomach-tube.[Footnote 115: Schliep, _Deutsch.13; Debore,
_L'Union med._, Dec.30, 1882; Bianchi, _Gaz.degli Ospitali_, March
26, 1884.]In a case of gastric
ulcer of Cornillon severe hemorrhage followed washing out the stomach
(_Le Prog.[Footnote 117: Soft rubber stomach-tubes are made by Tiemann & Co.in
New York, and are sold by most medical instrument-makers.A description
of the appropriate tube and of the method of its use is given by W. B.
Platt ("The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the Stomach," _Maryland
Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884).]Beyond the measures indicated there is little more to do in the way of
treatment directed toward the repair of the ulcer.Not much, if
anything, is to be expected from the employment of drugs which have
been claimed to exert a specific curative action on the ulcer.Of these
drugs those which have been held in the greatest repute are bismuth and
nitrate of silver.Trousseau[118] devised a somewhat complicated plan
for administering bismuth and nitrate of silver in succession for
several months in the treatment of gastric ulcer.There are few who any
longer cherish any faith in these drugs as curative of gastric ulcer.The same may be said of other drugs which have been thought to have
similar specific virtue in the treatment of gastric ulcer, such as
acetate of lead, arsenic, chloral hydrate, iodoform, etc.[Footnote 118: _Clinique medicale_, t. iii.{524} It remains to consider therapeutic measures which may be
necessary to combat individual symptoms of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric ulcer is generally relieved in a few days by strict
adherence to the dietetic regimen which has been laid down.When this
is not the case, it may be best to withhold all food from the stomach
and to nourish by the rectum.But this cannot be continued long without
weakening the patient, and sometimes the pain persists in spite of the
rest afforded the stomach.Undoubtedly, the most effective means of
quieting the pain of gastric ulcer is the administration of opium in
some form.Opium should not, however, be resorted to without full
consideration of the possible consequences.When the use of this drug
is once begun, the patient is liable to become dependent upon it, and
may be inclined, consciously or unconsciously, to exaggerate the pain
in order to obtain the narcotic.When prescribing opium in this disease
the physician should have in mind the danger of establishing the opium
habit.Moreover, opium <DW44>s digestion, and is anything but an aid to
the proper dietetic regimen, which is all-important.If it is decided
to give opium, it does not matter much in what form it is administered,
but the dose should be as small as will answer the purpose.Hypodermic
injections of morphine over the region of the stomach may be
recommended.Codeia often produces less disturbance than opium or
morphine.A useful powder for the relief of pain is one containing 8 or
10 grains of subnitrate of bismuth, 1/12 grain of sulphate of morphia,
and 1/5 grain of extract of belladonna.Much of the beneficial effect
attributed to bismuth is in reality due to its customary combination
with a small quantity of morphine.Before resorting to opium in cases
of severe pain it will be well to try some of the other means for
relieving the pain of gastric ulcer, although they are less effective.Gerhardt thinks that astringents are better than narcotics to relieve
the pain of ulcer, and he recommends for the purpose three or four
drops of solution of chloride of iron diluted with a wineglassful of
water, to be taken several times daily.Although this recommendation is
from high authority and is often quoted, sufficient confirmatory
evidence of its value is lacking.Other medicines recommended are
hyoscyamus, belladonna, choral hydrate, chloric ether, hydrocyanic
acid, bismuth, nitrate of silver, and compound kino powder.Sometimes
warm fomentations, at other times a light ice-bag over the epigastrium,
afford marked relief of the pain.Counter-irritation over the region of
the stomach has also given relief.Daniel went back to the office.This may be effected with a mustard
plaster or by croton oil.I have known the establishment of a small
nitric-acid issue in the pit of the stomach to relieve the pain, but
such severe measures of counter-irritation are generally unnecessary.The application of a few leeches over the epigastrium has been highly
recommended, but this should be done without much loss of blood.The
effect of position of the body upon the relief of pain should be
determined.When the pain is due to flatulence or to acid fermentation
in the stomach, the treatment should be directed to those states.The most effective means of controlling the vomiting in gastric ulcer
are the regulation of the diet and, if necessary, the resort to rectal
alimentation.Whenever small
quantities of milk, peptonized or in any other form, cannot be
retained, then exclusive rectal feeding may be tried for a while.There
have been cases of gastric {525} ulcer when both the stomach and the
rectum have been intolerant of food.In such desperate cases the
attempt may be made to introduce food into the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube, for it is a singular fact that food introduced in this
way is sometimes retained when everything taken by the mouth is
vomited.[119] The cautious washing out of the stomach by the
stomach-tube may prove beneficial.In these cases the attempt has also
been made to nourish by subcutaneous injections of food.In a case of
gastric ulcer where no food could be retained either by the stomach or
by the rectum Whittaker[120] injected subcutaneously milk,
beef-extract, and warmed cod-liver oil.The
injections were continued for four days without food by the mouth or
rectum.At the best, hypodermic alimentation can
afford but slight nourishment, and is to be regarded only as a last
refuge.If there is danger of death by exhaustion, transfusion may be
resorted to.[Footnote 119: Debore, _L'Union medicale_, Dec.30, 1882, and _Gaz.des
Hop._, April 29, 1884.For this reason Debore makes extensive use of
the stomach-tube in general in feeding patients affected with gastric
ulcer.He objects to an exclusive milk diet on account of the quantity
of fluid necessary to nourish the patient, which he says amounts to
three to four quarts of milk daily.To avoid these inconveniences, he
gives three times daily drachm viss of meat-powder and drachm iiss of
bicarbonate of sodium (or equal parts of calcined magnesia and bicarb.This is to be introduced by the
stomach-tube on account of its disagreeable taste.He believes that the
addition of the large quantity of alkali prevents digestion from
beginning until the food has reached the intestine.He also gives daily
a quart of milk containing grs.Debore's
method of preparing the meat-powder is described in _L'Union medicale_,
July 29, 1882, p.He also uses a milk-powder (_ibid._, Dec.30,
1882; see also _Le Progres med._, July 12, 1884).][Footnote 120: J. T. Whittaker, "Hypodermic Alimentation," _The
Clinic_, Jan.Bernutz practised successfully in two cases the hypodermic injection of
fresh dog's blood (_Gaz.Wochenschr._, 1875, No.of
olive oil twice a day subcutaneously without causing abscesses.Menzel and Porco were the first to employ hypodermic alimentation
(_ibid._, 1869, No.Of remedies to check vomiting, first in importance are ice swallowed in
small fragments and morphine administered hypodermically.Effervescent
drinks, such as Vichy, soda-water, and iced champagne, may bring
relief.Other remedies which have been recommended are bismuth,
hydrocyanic acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, iodine, bromide of
potash, calomel in small doses, and ingluvin.But in general it is best
to forego the use of drugs and to rely upon proper regulation of the
diet, such as iced milk taken in teaspoonful doses, and upon repose for
the stomach.Hemorrhage from the stomach is best treated by absolute rest, the
administration of bits of ice by the mouth, and the application of a
flat, not too heavy, ice-bag over the stomach.The patient should lie
as quietly as possible in the supine position, with light coverings and
in a cool atmosphere.He should be cautioned to make no exertion.His
apprehensions should be quieted so far as possible.All food should be
withheld from the stomach, and for four or five days after the
cessation of profuse hemorrhage aliment should be given only by the
rectum.There is no proof that styptics administered by the mouth have
any control over the hemorrhage, and as they are liable to excite
vomiting they may do harm.Ergotin, dissolved in water (1 part to 10),
may be injected hypodermically in grain doses several times repeated if
necessary.If internal styptics {526} are to be used, perhaps the best
are alum-whey and a combination of gallic acid 10 grains and dilute
sulphuric acid 10 drops diluted with water.Fox praises acetate of
lead, and others ergot, tannin, and Monsell's solution.If there is
vomiting or much restlessness, morphine should be given hypodermically.If the bleeding is profuse, elastic ligatures may be applied for a
short time around the upper part of one or more extremities, so as to
shut out temporarily from the circulation the blood contained in the
extremity.If syncope threatens, ammonia or a little ether may be
inhaled, or ether may be given hypodermically.Brandy, if administered,
should be given either by the rectum or hypodermically.Caution should
be exercised not to excite too vigorously the force of the circulation,
as the diminished force of the heart is an important agent in checking
hemorrhage.When life is threatened in consequence of the loss of
blood, then recourse may be had to transfusion, but experience has
shown that this act is liable to cause renewed hemorrhage in
consequence of the elevation of the blood-pressure which follows it.Transfusion is therefore indicated more for the acute anaemia after the
hemorrhage has ceased and is not likely to be renewed.It should not be
employed immediately after profuse haematemesis, unless it is probable
that otherwise the patient will die from the loss of blood, and then it
is well to transfuse only a small quantity.[121]

[Footnote 121: Michel transfused successfully in a case of extreme
anaemia following gastrorrhagia (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.In a case of profuse and repeated haematemesis which followed
washing out the stomach Michaelis infused into the veins 350 cc.Reaction gradually followed, and the patient
recovered.This case, which was one of probable ulcer, illustrates the
advantages of infusing a small quantity (_ibid._, June 23, 1884).The
dangers are illustrated by a case reported by V. Hacker, who infused
1500 cc.of salt solution in a patient in a state of extreme collapse
resulting from hemorrhage from gastric ulcer.The patient rallied, but
he died three hours after the infusion from renewed hemorrhage (_Wiener
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.In Legroux's case of gastric ulcer
renewed hemorrhage and death followed the transfusion of only 80
grammes of blood (_Arch.In a case quoted
by Roussel, Leroy transfused 130 grammes of blood in a girl twenty
years old who lay at the point of death from repeated hemorrhages from
a gastric ulcer.In the following night occurred renewed hemorrhage and
death (_Gaz.According to the experiments
of Schwartz and V. Ott, the transfusion, or rather infusion, of
physiological salt solution is as useful as that of blood, and it is
simpler and unattended with some of the dangers of blood-transfusion.The formula is chloride of sodium 6 parts, distilled water 1000.]Schilling recommends, when the bleeding is so profuse that the
patient's life is threatened, to tampon the stomach by means of a
rubber balloon attached to the end of a soft-rubber stomach-tube.[122]
The external surface of the balloon is slightly oiled.It is introduced
into the stomach in a collapsed state, and after its introduction it is
moderately distended with air.When the balloon is to be withdrawn the
air should be allowed slowly to escape.Schilling tried this procedure
in one case of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer, allowing the inflated bag
to remain in the stomach twelve minutes.The hemorrhage ceased and was
not renewed.Experience only can determine whether this device, to
which there are manifest objections, will prove a valuable addition to
our meagre means of controlling hemorrhage from the stomach.[Footnote 122: F. Schilling, _Aerztl.Schreiber, in order to determine the position of the stomach, was the
first to introduce and inflate in this organ a rubber balloon
(_Deutsches Arch.Uhler recommends in
case of profuse gastric hemorrhage to pass a rubber bag into the
stomach and fill it with liquid (_Maryland Med.{527} The boldest suggestion ever made for stopping gastric hemorrhage
is that of Rydygier, who advocates in case hemorrhage from an ulcer
threatens to be fatal to cut down upon the stomach, search for the
bleeding ulcer, and then resect it.[123] Notwithstanding the great
advances made in gastric surgery during the last few years, Rydygier's
suggestion seems extravagant and unwarrantable.The most effectual treatment of the dyspepsia which is present in many
cases of gastric ulcer is adherence to the dietetic rules which have
been laid down, aided by the administration of Carlsbad salts and
perhaps in extreme cases the occasional and cautious use of the
stomach-tube.If eructations of gas and heartburn are troublesome,
antacids may be employed, but they should be given in small doses and
not frequently, as the ultimate effect of alkalies is to increase the
acid secretion of the stomach and to impair digestion.The best alkali
to use is bicarbonate of sodium, of which a few grains may be taken dry
upon the tongue or dissolved in a little water.If perforation into the peritoneal cavity occur, then opium or
hypodermic injections of morphine should be given in large doses, as in
peritonitis.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Bran poultices sprinkled with laudanum or other warm
fomentations should be applied over the abdomen, although in Germany
ice-bags are preferred.Food should be administered only by the rectum.The chances of recovery are extremely slight, but the patient's
sufferings are thus relieved.In view of the almost certainly fatal
prognosis of perforation of gastric ulcer into the general peritoneal
cavity, and in view of the success attending various operations
requiring laparotomy, it would seem justifiable in these cases, after
arousing, if possible, the patient from collapse by the administration
of stimulants per rectum or hypodermically, to open the peritoneal
cavity and cleanse it with some tepid antiseptic solution, and then to
treat the perforation in the stomach and the case generally according
to established surgical methods.[124] This would be the more indicated
if it is known that the contents of the stomach at the time of
perforation are not of a bland nature.[Footnote 124: Mikulicz has successfully treated by laparotomy a case
of purulent peritonitis resulting from perforation of the intestine
with extravasation of the intestinal contents.He says that the
operation is not contraindicated by existing peritonitis if the patient
is not already in a state of collapse or sepsis.The perforation is
closed by sutures after freshening the edges of the opening (abstract
in the _Medical News_, Philada., Sept.Both Kuh and Rydygier
recommend opening the abdomen after perforation of gastric ulcer.The
borders of the ulcer are to be resected and the opening closed by
sutures (_Volkmann's Samml.It is important to maintain and to improve the patient's nutrition,
which often becomes greatly impaired from the effects of the ulcer.This indication is not altogether compatible with the all-important one
of reducing to a minimum the digestive work of the stomach.Nevertheless, some of the easily-digested articles of food which have
been mentioned are highly nutritious.By means of these and by good
hygienic management the physician should endeavor, without violating
the dietetic laws which have been laid down, to increase, so far as
possible, the strength of his patient.Starvation treatment in itself
is never indicated in gastric ulcer.Inunction of the body with oil is
useful in cases of gastric ulcer, as recommended by Pepper.[125]

[Footnote 125: _North Carolina Medical Journal_, 1880, vol.{528} In view of Daettwyler's experiments, mentioned on page 514, it is
manifestly important to counteract the anaemia of gastric ulcer.Iron,
however, administered by the mouth, disturbs the stomach and is
decidedly contraindicated during the active stage of gastric ulcer.During convalescence, only the blandest preparations of iron should be
given, and these not too soon, lest they cause a relapse.When the
indication to remove the anaemia is urgent, and especially when the
chlorotic form of anaemia exists, it may be well to try the hypodermic
method of administering iron, although this method has not yet been
made thoroughly satisfactory.Especially for the anaemia of gastric
ulcer would an efficient and unirritating preparation of iron for
hypodermic administration prove a great boon.Probably at present the
best preparation for hypodermic use is the citrate of iron, given in
one- to two-grain doses in a 10 per cent.aqueous solution, which when
used must be clear and not over a month old.The syringe and needle
shortly before using should be washed with carbolic acid.The
injections are best borne when made into the long muscles of the back
or into the nates, as recommended by Lewin for injections of corrosive
sublimate.A slight burning pain is felt for ten minutes after the
injection.This is the method employed by Quincke with good result and
without inflammatory reaction.[126] It is well to remember that
Kobert[127] has found by experiment on animals that large doses of iron
injected subcutaneously cause nephritis.Other preparations of iron
which have been recommended for hypodermic use are ferrum dialysatum
(DaCosta), ferrum pyrophosphoricum cum natr.citrico (Neuss), ferrum
pyrophosphoricum cum ammon.(Huguenin), ferrum peptonatum and
ferrum oleinicum (Rosenthal).[128] When it becomes safe to administer
iron by the stomach, then the blander preparations should be used, such
as the pyrophosphate, lactate, effervescing citrate, ferrum redactum.60, Gelatin q. s.; make 90 pills: at first one, and
afterward as many as three, of these pills may be taken three times a
day.When carefully prepared the pills are about as soft as butter.[Footnote 126: Quincke, _Deutsch.27;
Glaenecke, _Arch.[Footnote 128: DaCosta, _N.Y.290; Neuss,

1878, Nos.45-49, and 1884, Jan.Various sequels of gastric ulcer may require treatment.Cicatrization
of the ulcer is by no means always cure in the clinical sense.As the
result of adhesions and the formation and contraction of cicatricial
tissue very serious disturbances of the functions of the stomach may
follow the repair of gastric ulcer.The most important of these sequels
is stenosis of the orifices of the stomach, particularly of the pyloric
orifice.Very considerable stenosis of the pylorus may be produced
before the ulcer is completely cicatrized.In three instances a
stenosing ulcer of the pylorus has been successfully extirpated.[129]
The most important of these sequels {529} of gastric ulcer will be
treated of hereafter.Here it need only be said that during
convalescence from gastric ulcer attention to diet is all-important.For a long time the diet should be restricted to easily-digested food.The first symptoms of relapse are to be met by prompt return to bland
diet, or, if necessary, to rectal alimentation.[Footnote 129: The successful operators were Rydygier (_Berl.16, 1882), Czerny (_Arch.1), and Van Kleef (_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1882, Bd.Cavazzani cut out by an elliptical incision an old
indurated ulcer of the stomach adherent to the anterior abdominal
walls.The patient died three years afterward of phthisis (_Centralbl.f. Chir._, 1879, p.Lauenstein resected the pylorus
unsuccessfully for what appears to have been an ulcer of the pylorus
with fibroid induration around it (_ibid._, 1882, No.These four
cases (three successful) are all which I have found recorded of
resection of gastric ulcer.In my opinion the resection of gastric
ulcers which resist all other methods of treatment, and especially
those which cause progressive stricture of the pylorus, is a
justifiable operation.]Ulcers of the stomach which do not belong to the category of simple
ulcer are for the most part of pathological rather than of clinical
interest.Although miliary tubercles in the walls of the stomach are more
frequent than is generally supposed, genuine tuberculous ulcers of the
stomach are not common.The most important criterion of these ulcers is
the presence of tuberculous lymphatic glands in the neighborhood, and
of miliary tubercles upon the peritoneum corresponding to the ulcer.Sometimes miliary tubercles can be discovered in the floor and sides of
the ulcer.Tuberculous gastric ulcers, when they occur, are usually
associated with tuberculous ulceration of the intestine.In an
undoubted case of tuberculous ulcer of the stomach reported by Litten,
however, this was the only ulcer to be found in the digestive
tract.[130] Tuberculous gastric ulcers generally produce no symptoms,
but they have been known to cause perforation of the stomach and
haematemesis.Many cases which have been recorded as tuberculous ulcers
of the stomach were in reality simple ulcers.Cheesy tubercles as large
as a pea, both ulcerated and non-ulcerated, have been found in the
stomach, but they are very rare.[Footnote 130: Litten, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Typhoid ulcers may also occur in the stomach, but they are infrequent.Both perforation of the stomach and gastrorrhagia have been caused by
typhoid ulcers, which, as a rule, however, produce no symptoms
distinctly referable to the ulcer.Syphilitic ulcers and syphilitic cicatrices of the stomach have been
described, without sufficient proof as to their being syphilitic in
origin.Necrotic ulcers, probably mycotic in origin, may be found in the
stomach in cases of splenic fever, erysipelas, pyaemia, etc.Ulceration occurring in toxic, in diphtheritic, and in phlegmonous
gastritis need not be discussed here.Follicular and catarrhal ulcers of the stomach have been described, but
without sufficient ground for separating them from hemorrhagic erosion
on the one hand and simple ulcer on the other.Hemorrhagic erosions of the stomach, to which formerly so much
importance was attached, are now believed to be without clinical
significance.They are found very frequently, and often very
abundantly, after death from a great variety of causes.{530}

CANCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Cancer of the stomach is characterized anatomically by the
formation in this organ of a new growth, composed of a
connective-tissue stroma so arranged as to enclose alveoli or spaces
containing cells resembling epithelial cells.The growth extends by
invading the tissues surrounding it, and frequently gives rise to
secondary cancerous deposits in other organs of the body.The forms of
cancer which occur primarily in the stomach are scirrhous, medullary,
colloid, and cylindrical epithelial cancer.Rarely latent, occasionally without symptoms
pointing to the stomach as the seat of disease, gastric cancer is
usually attended by the following symptoms: loss of appetite,
indigestion, vomiting with or without admixture with blood, pain, a
tumor in or near the epigastric region, progressive loss of flesh and
strength, and the development of the so-called cancerous cachexia.The
disease is not curable.After its recognition it rarely lasts longer
than from twelve to fifteen months.SYNONYMS.--Carcinoma ventriculi; Malignant disease of the stomach.Of
the many synonyms for the special forms of cancer, the most common
are--for scirrhous, hard, fibrous; for medullary, encephaloid, soft,
fungoid; for colloid, gelatinous, mucoid, alveolar; and for cylindrical
epithelial, cylindrical-celled or cylindrical or columnar epithelioma,
cylindrical-celled cancroid, destructive adenoma.HISTORY.--Cancer of the stomach was known to the ancients only by
certain disturbances of the gastric functions which it produces.The
disease itself was not clearly appreciated until its recognition by
post-mortem examinations, which began to be made with some frequency
after the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century.During the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries several instances of gastric
cancer are recorded, the best described being those observed and
collected by Morgagni (1761).During this period scirrhus was regarded
as the type of cancerous disease.It was a common custom to call only
the ulcerated scirrhous tumors cancerous.With the awakened interest in pathological anatomy which marked the
beginning of the present century, the gross anatomical characters of
cancer and the main forms of the disease came to be more clearly
recognized.After the description of encephaloid cancer by Laennec[1]
in 1812, {531} and the first clear recognition of colloid cancer by
Otto[2] in 1816, these two forms of cancer took rank with scirrhus as
constituting the varieties of cancer of the stomach as well as of
cancer elsewhere.All that it was possible to accomplish in the
description of cancer of the stomach from a purely gross anatomical
point of view reached its culmination in the great pathological works
of Cruveilhier (1829-35) and of Carswell (1838), both of whom admirably
delineated several specimens of gastric cancer.des Sciences med._, t. i. and t.xii., Paris,
1812-15.][Footnote 2: Otto, _Seltens Beobachtungen, etc._, 1816.]During this period of active anatomical research the symptomatology of
gastric cancer was not neglected.The article on cancer by Bayle and
Cayol in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, published in 1812,
shows how well the clinical history of gastric cancer was understood at
that period.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach could not be recognized
as a separate form of tumor until the application of the microscope to
the study and classification of tumors--an era introduced by Muller in
1838.[3] Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach was first
recognized by Reinhardt in 1851, was subsequently described by Bidder
and by Virchow, and received a full and accurate description from
Forster in 1858.[4]

[Footnote 3: _Ueber den feineren Ban, etc., der krankh.Geschwulste_,
Berlin, 1838.][Footnote 4: Reinhardt, _Annalen d. Charite_, ii.1, 1851; Bidder,
_Muller's Archiv_, 1852, p.178; Virchow, _Gaz.de Paris_, April
7, 1855; Forster, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Until the publication by Waldeyer[5] in 1867 of his memorable article
on the development of cancers, it was generally accepted that gastric
cancer originated in the submucous coat of the stomach, and that the
cells in the cancerous alveoli were derived from connective-tissue
cells.Waldeyer attempted to establish for the stomach his doctrine
that all cancers are of epithelial origin.In all varieties of gastric
cancer he believed that he could demonstrate the origin of the
cancer-cells from epithelial cells of the gastric tubules--a mode of
origin which had previously been advocated for cylindrical epithelioma
by Cornil[6] (1864).Waldeyer's view has met with marked favor since
its publication, but there are eminent pathologists who have not given
adherence to it in the exclusive form advocated by its author.[Footnote 5: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.It is somewhat remarkable that although in the early part of the
present century several monographs on gastric cancer appeared,[7] all
the more recent contributions to the subject are to be found in theses,
scattered journal articles, and text-books.Of the more recent careful
and extensive articles on cancer of the stomach, those of Lebert and of
Brinton are perhaps most worthy of mention.[8]

[Footnote 7: Chardel, Benech, Daniel, Germain, Prus, Sharpey, Barras,
etc.][Footnote 8: Lebert, _Die Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878;
Brinton, _Brit.ETIOLOGY.--The data for estimating the frequency of gastric cancer are
the clinical statistics of hospitals, series of recorded autopsies, and
mortuary registration reports.Statistics with reference to this point based exclusively upon the
clinical material of hospitals have only relative value, as they do not
{532} represent in proper proportion both sexes, all ages, all classes
in life, and all diseases.Statistics based upon autopsies surpass all
others in certainty of diagnosis, but they possess in even greater
degree the defects urged against hospital statistics.Not all the fatal
cases in hospitals are examined post-mortem, and gastric cancer is
among the diseases most likely to receive such examination.Hence
estimates of frequency based exclusively upon autopsies are liable to
be excessive.Estimates from mortuary registration reports, and
therefore from the diagnoses given in death-certificates, rest
manifestly upon a very untrustworthy basis as regards diagnosis, but in
other respects they represent the ideal point of view, including, as
these reports do, all causes of death among all classes of persons.It
is evident that in all methods of estimating the frequency of gastric
cancer inhere important sources of error.In general, the larger the
number of cases upon which the estimates rest the less prominent are
the errors.Such estimates as we possess are to be regarded only as
approximate, and subject to revision.From mortuary statistics Tanchou estimates the frequency of gastric
cancer as compared with that of all causes of death at 0.6 per cent.;
Virchow, at 1.9 per cent.; and D'Espine, at 2-1/2
per cent.[9]

[Footnote 9: Tanchou, _Rech.des Tumeurs du
Sein_, Paris, 1844.These statistics, which are based upon an analysis
of 382,851 deaths in the department of the Seine, are necessarily
subject to sources of error, but they do not seem to me to deserve the
harsh criticisms of Lebert and others.Virchow, _Verhandl.Wurzburg_, 1860, vol.49--analysis of 3390 deaths in Wurzburg during the years 1852-55.Wyss, quoted by Ebstein in _Volkmann's Samml.87--analysis of 4800 deaths in Zurich from 1872-74.D'Espine, _Echo medical_, 1858, vol.ii.--mortuary statistics of the
canton of Geneva, considered to be particularly accurate.]In 8468 autopsies, chiefly from English hospitals, Brinton[10] found
gastric cancer recorded in 1 per cent.Gussenbauer and
Von Winiwarter[11] found gastric cancer recorded in 1-1/2 per cent.of
the 61,287 autopsies in the Pathological Anatomical Institute of the
Vienna University.From an analysis of 11,175 autopsies in Prague, I
find gastric cancer in 3-1/2 per cent.[12]

[Footnote 10: _Loc.cit._]

[Footnote 11: _Arch.[Footnote 12: Statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Willigk, Wrany, and
Eppinger, in _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x.,
xii., xiv., xxvii., l., xciv., xcix., and cxiv.Grunfeld found in 1150
autopsies in the general hospital for aged persons in Copenhagen 102
cancers of the stomach, or 9 per cent.(_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.I have collected and analyzed with reference to this point the
statistics of death from all causes in the city of New York for the
fifteen years from 1868 to 1882, inclusive.[13] I find that of the
444,564 deaths during this period, cancer of the stomach was assigned
as the cause in 1548 cases and cancer of the liver in 867 cases.Probably at least one-third of the primary cancers of the liver are to
be reckoned as gastric cancers.This would make the ratio of gastric
cancer to all causes of death about 0.4 per cent.(0.93) if only the deaths from twenty years of age
upward be taken: gastric cancer hardly ever occurs under that age.It
is probably fair to conclude that in New York not over 1 in 200 of the
deaths occurring at all ages and from all causes {533} is due to cancer
of the stomach, and that about 1 in 100 of the deaths from twenty years
of age upward is due to this cause.[Footnote 13: These statistics are obtained from the records of the
Board of Health of the city of New York.These records are kept with
great care and system.]The organs most frequently affected with primary cancer are the uterus
and stomach.In order to determine the relative frequency of cancer in
these situations, I have compiled the following table of statistics
from various sources:[14]

    Primary Cancers.-------------------------  --------------  --------------
  11,131 in Vienna           10   per cent.7,150 in New York         25.7  "   "     24.2  "   "
   9,118 in Paris (Tanchou)  25.2  "   "     32.8  "   "
   1,378 in Paris (Salle)    31.9  "   "     32    "   "
     587 in Berlin           35.8  "   "     25    "   "
     183 in Wurzburg         34.9  "   "     19    "   "
   1,046 in Prague           37.6  "   "     33.3  "   "
     889 in Geneva           45    "   "     15.6  "   "
  ------                     ----            ----
  31,482 total               21.4 per cent.From this table it appears that in some collections of cases the uterus
is the most frequent seat of primary cancer, while in other collections
the stomach takes the first rank.If the sum-total of all the cases be
taken, the conclusion would be that about one-fifth of all primary
cancers are seated in the stomach, and somewhat less than one-third in
the uterus.Even if allowance be made for the apparently too low
percentage of cases of gastric cancer in the large Vienna
statistics,[15] I should still be inclined to place the uterus first in
the list of organs most frequently affected with primary cancer, and to
estimate the frequency of gastric cancer compared with that of primary
cancer elsewhere as not over 25 per cent.[Footnote 14: Vienna cases: Gurlt, _Arch.421--statistical analysis of 16,637 tumors observed in the three large
hospitals of Vienna from 1855 to 1878.New York cases: see preceding
foot-note.Paris cases: Tanchou, _op.cit._, and Salle, _Etiologie de
la Carcinose_, These, Paris, 1877, p.145 _et seq._--fatal cases in
Paris hospitals, 1861-63.Berlin cases: Lange, _Ueber den Magenkrebs_,
Inaug.Diss., Berlin, 1877--post-mortem material.Wurzburg cases:
Virchow, _loc.cit._, and _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Prague
cases: reference given above--post-mortem material.Geneva cases:
D'Espine, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 15: That this percentage is too low is apparent from the fact
that the number of cases of gastric cancer is only twice that of
primary cancer of liver in Gurlt's statistics.]The liability to gastric cancer seems to be the same in both sexes.Of
2214 cases of gastric cancer which I have collected from hospital
statistics, and which were nearly all confirmed by autopsy, 1233 were
in males and 981 in females.[16] This makes the ratio of males to
females about 5 to 4.This difference is so slight that no importance
can be attached to it, especially in view of the fact that in most
hospitals the males are in excess of the females.[Footnote 16: My statistics regarding sex are obtained from _Prager
Vierteljahrschr._, vols.xvii., l., xciv., xcix., cxiv.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _Beitr.zur Statistik d. Magencarcinoms_,
Jena, 1878; Leudet, _Bull.564; Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _Diseases of
Abdomen_, Philada., 1879; and _Ann.zu
Munchen_, Bd.If to these accurate statistics be added collections of cases from
heterogeneous sources, including mortuary statistics (Brinton, Louis,
D'Espine, Virchow, Gurlt, Welch), there results a total of 5426 cases,
with 2843 males and 2583 females, the two sexes being more evenly
represented than in the more exact statistics given in the text.In
this collection of cases Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's cases only up
to the year 1855 are included, as the subsequent ones are doubtless in
great part included in Gurlt's statistics.According to Brinton,
gastric cancer is twice as frequent in males as in females.]{534} The following table gives the age in 2038 cases of gastric cancer
obtained from trustworthy sources and arranged according to
decades:[17]

   Age.------      ----------------  ---------
  10-20.2           0.1
  20-30.55           2.7
  30-40.271          13.3
  40-50.499          24.5
  50-60.620          30.4
  60-70.428          21
  70-80.140           6.85
  80-90.20           1
  90-100.2           0.1
  Over 100.1           0.05

From this analysis we may conclude that three-fourths of all gastric
cancers occur between forty and seventy years of age.The absolutely
largest number is found between fifty and sixty years, but, taking into
consideration the number of those living, the liability to gastric
cancer is as great between sixty and seventy years of age.Nevertheless, the number of cases between thirty and forty years is
considerable, and the occurrence of gastric cancer even between twenty
and thirty is not so exceptional as is often represented, and is by no
means to be ignored.The liability to gastric cancer seems to lessen
after seventy years of age, but here the number of cases and the number
of those living are so small that it is hazardous to draw positive
conclusions.[Footnote 17: The sources of the statistics for age are--Dittrich
(160), _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; D'Espine (117), _loc.cit._; Virchow (63), _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.429; Leudet (69),
_loc.cit._; Lange (147), _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen (60), _op.cit._; Gussenbauer and Von Winiwarter (493 cases up to 1855), _loc.cit._; Lebert (314), _op.cit._; Habershon (76), _op.cit._; Gurlt
(455), _loc.The results correspond
closely to those of the smaller statistics of Brinton and of Lebert.]Cancer of the stomach in childhood is among the rarest of diseases.Steiner and Neureutter[18] failed to find a single gastric cancer in
2000 autopsies on children.Cullingworth[19] has reported with
microscopical examination a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma in a
male infant dying at the age of five weeks; it is probable that the
tumor was congenital.It is not certain whether Wilkinson's[20]
often-quoted case of congenital scirrhus of the pylorus in an infant
five weeks old was a cancer or an instance of simple hypertrophy.Kaulich[21] cites a case of colloid cancer affecting the stomach,
together with nearly all the abdominal organs, in a child a year and a
half old, but whether the growth in the stomach was primary or
secondary is not mentioned.The case which Widerhofer[22] has reported
as one of cancer of the stomach secondary to cancer of the
retro-peritoneal glands in an infant sixteen days old seems from the
description to be sarcoma.Scheffer[23] has reported a case of large
ulcerated encephaloid cancer of the fundus, involving the spleen, in a
boy fourteen years old.Jackson[24] has reported an interesting case of
encephaloid cancer in a boy fifteen years old in whom no evidence of
disease existed up {535} to ten weeks before death.These cases, which
are all that I have been able to find in children, are to be regarded
as pathological curiosities.[25]

Boston Society for Medical Improvement_, vol.[Footnote 25: Mathien (_Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884)
has recently analyzed, chiefly from a clinical point of view, 27 cases
of gastric cancer occurring under thirty-four years of age.Of these, 3
were under twenty and 14 were between twenty and thirty years.He also
emphasizes the error of considering cancer of the stomach as
exclusively a disease of advanced life.]Such statistics as we possess would make it appear that gastric cancer,
as well as cancer in general, is somewhat less common in the United
States than in the greater part of Europe.[26] These statistics,
however, are too inaccurate, and the problems involved in their
interpretation are too complex, to justify us in drawing any positive
conclusions as to this point.It is certain that cancer is not a rare
disease in the United States.[Footnote 26: Of 1000 deaths in New York in 1882, 19.3 were from
cancer.The statistics on this point from some of the large European
cities are--Geneva, 53 deaths from cancer per mille; Frankfort, 47.6;
Copenhagen, 33.2; Christiania, 29; London, 28.7; Paris, 27; Edinburgh,
25.4; Berlin, 22.4; St.Petersburg, 15; Amsterdam, 12.These statistics
are obtained from the _Forty-fourth Annual Report of the
Registrar-General (for 1881)_, London, 1883; from _Preussische
Statistik_, Heft lxiii., Berlin, 1882; and from _Traite de la
Climatologie medicale_, Paris, 1877-80, by Lombard, in whose excellent
work will be found much information on this subject.To judge from statistics in this country and in England, the death-rate
from cancer is undergoing a rapid annual increase.Whereas in New York
in 1868 this death-rate was only 12.6 per mille, in 1882 it was 19.3.In England and Wales in 1858 the deaths from cancer per 1,000,000
persons living were 329, and in 1881 they were 520.It seems probable,
as suggested in the above report of the Registrar-General, that this
apparently increasing large death-rate is due to increased accuracy in
diagnosis.It may be also that decrease in infant mortality and
prolongation of life by improved sanitary regulations may account in
part for this increase.From this point of view Dunn makes the
paradoxical statement that the cancer-rate of a country may be accepted
as an index of its healthfulness (_Brit.Journ._, 1883, i.).]It is said on good authority that in Egypt and Turkey gastric cancer
and other forms of cancer are infrequent.[27] A similar infrequency has
been claimed for South America, the Indies, and in general for tropical
and subtropical countries; but all of these statements as to the
geographical distribution of cancer are to be accepted with great
reserve, as they do not rest upon sufficient statistical information.[Footnote 27: Hirsch, _Handb.d. Historisch-geographische Pathologie_,
Bd.379, Erlangen, 1862-64.]I have analyzed the frequency of gastric cancer among <DW64>s upon a
basis of 7518 deaths among this race in New York, and I find the
proportion of deaths from this cause about one-third less than among
white persons.[28] It has been stated that cancer is an extremely rare
disease among <DW64>s in Africa.[29] The admixture with white blood
makes it difficult to determine to what degree pure <DW64>s in this
country are subject to cancer.[Footnote 28: According to the Ninth Census Report of the United
States, in the census year 1870 the deaths from cancer among white
persons were 13.7 per mille, and among <DW52> persons only 5.7 per
mille; but it is well known that the registration returns upon which
the vital statistics in these reports are based are very incomplete and
unsatisfactory.][Footnote 29: Bordier, _La Geographie medicale_, Paris, 1884, p.Livingstone speaks of the infrequency of cancer among the <DW64>s in
Africa.]The question as to what role is played by heredity in the causation of
gastric cancer belongs to the etiological study of cancer in general.of the cases of cancer it can be
determined that other members of the family are or have been affected
with the disease.[30] {536} The influence of inheritance, therefore, is
apparent only in a comparatively small minority of the cases.As
suggested long ago by Matthew Baillie, this hereditary influence is
better interpreted as in favor of a local predisposition (embryonic
abnormality?)in the organ or part affected than in favor of the
inheritance of a cancerous diathesis.It has been claimed by D'Espine,
Paget, and others that cancer develops at an earlier age when there is
a family history of the disease than when such history is absent.[Footnote 30: This statement is based upon the collection of 1744 cases
of cancer analyzed with reference to this question.Of these, a family
history of cancer was determined in 243 cases.The cases are obtained
from statistics of Paget and Baker, Sibley, Moore, Cooke, Lebert,
Lafond, Hess, Leichtenstern, Von Winiwarter, and Oldekop.There is
extraordinary variation in the conclusions of different observers upon
this point.Velpeau asserted that he could trace hereditary taint in 1
in 3 cancerous subjects; Paget, in 1 in 4; Cripps, in 1 in 28.My
conclusions agree with those obtained at the London Cancer Hospital
(Cooke, _On Cancer_, p.The most remarkable instance of inherited cancer on record is reported
by Broca (_Traite des Tumeurs_, vol.151, Paris, 1866): 15 out of
26 descendants over thirty years of age of a woman who died in 1788 of
cancer of the breast were likewise affected with cancer.As is well
known, Napoleon the First, his father, and his sister died of cancer of
the stomach.]It may be considered established that cancer sometimes develops in a
simple ulcer of the stomach, either open or cicatrized.It is most
likely to develop in large and deep ulcers with thickened edges, where
complete closure by cicatrization is very difficult or impossible.It
is difficult to prove anatomically that a gastric cancer has developed
from an ulcer, and hence such statements as that of Eppinger, that in
11.4 per cent.of cancers of the stomach this mode of development
existed, are of no especial value.[31] No etiological importance can be
attached to the occasional association of cancer with open or
cicatrized simple ulcers in different parts of the same stomach.Of the
comparatively few cases in which strict anatomical proof has been
brought of the origin of cancer in simple gastric ulcer, probably the
most carefully investigated and conclusive is one studied and reported
by Hauser.[32] It is, however, by no means proven that Hauser's view is
correct, that cancer develops from the atypical epithelial growths
often to be found in the cicatricial tissue of gastric ulcer.In a few
instances both the clinical history and the anatomical appearances
speak decisively for the development of cancer in a simple gastric
ulcer;[33] and the establishment of this fact is of clinical
importance.[Footnote 31: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.[Footnote 32: _Das chronische Maqengeschwur_, Leipzig, 1883, p.See
also Heitler, "Entwicklung von Krebs auf narbigen Grunde in Magen,"
_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, p.It seems to me that at present
there is a tendency to exaggerate the frequency with which cancer
develops from gastric ulcer.][Footnote 33: A particularly satisfactory case of this kind is reported
by Lebert, _op.Many other factors in the causation of gastric cancer have been
alleged, but without proof of their efficacy.This is true of chronic
gastritis, which was once thought to be an important cause of gastric
cancer, and is even recently admitted by Leube to be of influence.[34]
Certainly the majority of cases of cancer of the stomach are not
preceded by symptoms of chronic gastritis.Although in a few instances
gastric cancer has followed an injury in the region of the stomach,
there is no reason to suppose that this was more than a coincidence.[Footnote 34: In _Ziemssen's Handb.Few, if any, at present believe that depressing emotions, such as
grief, anxiety, disappointment, which were once considered important
causes of cancer, exert any such influence.Cancer of the stomach
occurs as {537} frequently in those of strong as in those of weak
constitution--as often among the temperate as among the intemperate.If, as has been claimed (D'Espine), gastric cancer is relatively more
frequent among the rich than among the poor, this is probably due only
to the fact that a larger number of those in favorable conditions of
life attain the age at which there is greatest liability to this
disease.No previous condition of constitution, no previous disease, no
occupation, no station in life, can be said to exert any causative
influence in the production of gastric cancer.It will be observed that the obscurity which surrounds the ultimate
causation of gastric cancer is in no way cleared up by the points which
have been here considered and which are usually considered under the
head of etiology.It is impossible to avoid the assumption of an
individual--and in my opinion a local--predisposition to gastric
cancer, vague as this assumption appears.All other supposed causes are
at the most merely occasional or exciting causes.The attempts to
explain in what this predisposition consists are of a speculative
nature, and will be briefly considered in connection with the
pathenogenesis of gastric cancer.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--We may distinguish the following groups of cases of
gastric cancer:

First: Latent cases, in which the cancer of the stomach has produced no
symptoms up to the time of death.Many secondary cancers of the stomach
belong to this class.Here also belong cases in which a cancer is found
unexpectedly in the stomach when death has resulted from other causes.I have found a medullary cancer, slightly ulcerated, as large as a
hen's egg, seated upon the posterior wall and lesser curvature of the
stomach of a laboring man suddenly killed while in apparent health and
without previous complaint of gastric disturbance.These cases, in
which life is cut short before any manifestation of the disease, are
without clinical significance, save to indicate how fallacious it is to
estimate the duration of the cancerous growth from the first appearance
of the symptoms.Second: Cases in which gastric symptoms are absent or insignificant,
whereas symptoms of general marasmus or of progressive anaemia or of
cachectic dropsy are prominent.Cases of this class are frequently
mistaken for pernicious anaemia, and occasionally for Bright's disease,
heart disease, or phthisis.It is difficult to explain in these cases
the tolerance of the stomach for the cancerous growth, but this
tolerance is most frequently manifested when the tumor does not invade
the orifices of the organ.Third: Cases in which the symptoms of the primary gastric cancer are
insignificant, but the symptoms of secondary cancer, particularly of
cancer of the liver or of the peritoneum, predominate.In some, but not
in all, of these cases the primary growth is small or has spared the
orifices of the stomach.Fourth: Cases in which the symptoms point to some disease of the
stomach, or at least to some abdominal disease; but the absence of
characteristic symptoms renders the diagnosis of gastric cancer
impossible or only conjectural.Fifth: Typical cases in which symptoms sufficiently characteristic of
{538} gastric cancer are present, so that the diagnosis can be made
with reasonable positiveness.It is not to be understood that these groups represent sharply-drawn
types of the disease.It often happens that the same case may present
at one period the features of one group, and at another period those of
another group.Nor is it supposed that every exceptional and erratic
case of gastric cancer can be classified in any of the groups which
have been mentioned.[35]

[Footnote 35: In the thesis of Chesnel may be found many curious
clinical disguises which may be assumed by cancer of the stomach, such
as simulation of Bright's disease, heart disease, phthisis, chronic
bronchitis, cirrhosis of the liver, etc.(_Etude clinique sur le Cancer
latent de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1877).Annals Albany_, 1883,
p.207) reports a case of gastric cancer in which extra-uterine
foetation was suspected.]A typical case of gastric cancer runs a course about as follows: A
person, usually beyond middle age, begins to suffer from disordered
digestion.His appetite is impaired, and a sense of uneasiness,
increasing in course of time to actual pain, is felt in the stomach.These symptoms of dyspepsia are in no way peculiar, and probably at
first occasion little anxiety.It is, however, soon observed that the
patient is losing flesh and strength more rapidly than can be explained
by simple indigestion.Vomiting, which was usually absent at first, makes its
appearance and becomes more and more frequent.After a while it may be
that, without any improvement, the vomiting becomes less frequent,
comes on longer after a meal, but is more copious.In the later periods
of the disease a substance resembling coffee-grounds and consisting of
altered blood is often mingled with the vomit.By this time the patient
has assumed a cachectic look.He is wasted, and his complexion has the
peculiar pale yellowish tint of malignant disease.Perhaps there is a
little oedematous pitting about the ankles.During the progress of the
disease in the majority of cases an irregular hard tumor can be felt in
the epigastrium.While one or another of the symptoms may abate in
severity, the general progress of the disease is relentlessly downward.Within six months to two years of the onset of the symptoms the patient
dies of exhaustion.Too much stress should not be laid upon any so-called typical course of
gastric cancer.This course is modified by many circumstances, such as
the situation of the cancer, its size, its rapidity of growth, the
presence or absence of ulceration, the existence or non-existence of
secondary tumors, the presence of complications, and the individuality
of the patient.It is necessary, therefore, to consider in detail each
of the important symptoms of gastric cancer.But in thus fixing
attention upon individual symptoms one must not lose sight of the
clinical picture as a whole.It is not any single symptom which is
decisive; it is rather the combination, the mode of onset, and the
course of the symptoms, which are of most importance in diagnosis.Impairment of the appetite is the rule in gastric cancer.Anorexia is
sometimes a marked symptom before pain, vomiting, and other evidences
of gastric indigestion are noted.There is often a special distaste for
meat.The appetite may be capricious; it is very rarely even increased.There are exceptional cases in which the appetite is preserved
throughout the greater part or even the whole course of the disease.This seems to {539} be more frequent with cancer of the cardia than
with cancer of other parts of the stomach.Loss of appetite is a much
more common symptom in gastric cancer than in gastric ulcer.In cancer,
as well as in ulcer, the patient sometimes refrains from food less on
account of disrelish for it than on account of the distress which it
causes him.Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms of cancer of the stomach.If
the pain begins early in the disease, and continues, as it often does,
with increasing severity, it renders gastric cancer one of the most
distressing affections.The pain is usually felt in the epigastrium,
but it may be more intense in the hypochondria.It is sometimes felt in
the interscapular region, the shoulders, or even in the loins.[36] With
cancer of the cardia it is often referred to the point of the xiphoid
cartilage or behind the sternum.In general, however, there is so
little correspondence between the site of the cancer and the exact
locality of the pain that no weight can be attached to the situation of
the pain in diagnosing the region of the stomach involved in the
growth.Nor does any import attach to the quality of the pain, whether
it is described as burning, gnawing, dull, lancinating, etc.Severe
gastralgic paroxysms occur, although less frequently than in gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 36: The pain in cases of gastric cancer may be felt in parts
of the body remote from the stomach.Thus, in a case of cancer of the
cardia reported by Minot the pain was felt, not in the epigastrium, but
in the left shoulder, the back of the neck, and the pharynx.In several
instances the pain has been interpreted as of renal origin.In a case
of gastric cancer reported by Palmer each attack of vomiting was
invariably preceded by pain in the middle of the shaft of the left
humerus (_Extr.The pain is usually aggravated by ingestion of food, although it may
not become severe until the process of digestion is far advanced.Pain,
however, occurs independently of taking food, and is occasionally a
marked symptom when there are no evidences of dyspepsia.There can be
no doubt that the cancer, as such, produces pain by involvement of the
nerves of the stomach, but there is no specific cancerous pain, such as
has been described by Brinton and other writers.There is usually
tenderness on pressure over the stomach, and this tenderness is often
over the tumor, if such can be felt.In general, it may be said that the pain of gastric cancer, as
contrasted with that of simple gastric ulcer, is often less dependent
upon taking food, less intense, less circumscribed, less paroxysmal,
less often relieved by vomiting; but there is so little constancy about
any of these points that no reliance is to be placed upon any
peculiarity of the pain in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.The observation of several cases of gastric cancer without pain as a
marked symptom leads me to emphasize the fact that absence or trifling
severity of pain throughout the greater part or the whole of the
disease, although exceptional, is not extremely rare.The frequency of
painless gastric cancers is given by Lebert as 25 per cent., and by
Brinton as 8 per cent., of the whole number.For many reasons,
numerical computations as to the frequency of this and of other
symptoms of gastric cancer are of very limited value.[37] Absence of
pain is more common in {540} gastric cancers of old persons and in
cancers not involving the orifices of the stomach than it is at an
earlier period of life or when the gastric orifices are obstructed.[Footnote 37: Gastric cancer cannot be considered as a disease with
uniform characters.It is irrational to group together cancers of the
pylorus, of the cardia, of the fundus, of the curvatures, cancers hard
and soft, ulcerated and not ulcerated, infiltrating and circumscribed,
and to say that pain or vomiting is present in so-and-so many cases of
cancer of the stomach.There is not a sufficient number of recorded
cases in which the symptoms are fully described with reference to the
peculiarities of the growth to enable us to apply to gastric cancer the
numerical method of clinical study with valuable results.The great
discrepancy between Lebert's and Brinton's statistics as to the
frequency of painless cancers of the stomach illustrates the present
inadequacy of the numerical method, which is misleading in so far as it
gives a false appearance of exactness.]The functions of the stomach are almost invariably disordered in
gastric cancer.Sometimes, especially in the early stages, this
disorder is only moderate, and is manifested by the milder symptoms of
indigestion, such as uneasy sensations of weight and fulness after a
meal, nausea, flatulent distension of the stomach relieved by
eructation of gases, and heartburn.With the progress of the disease
the uneasy sensations become actually painful; watery fluids, and
sometimes offensive acrid fluids and gases, are regurgitated; and
nausea culminates in vomiting.The
eructation of inflammable gases has been observed in a few cases.The most troublesome symptoms of indigestion occur with those cancers
which by obstructing the pyloric orifice lead to dilatation of the
stomach.Cases of gastric cancer in which the distressing symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach dominate the clinical history are frequent.These symptoms are in no way peculiar to cancer of the stomach, but
belong to dilatation produced by pyloric stenosis from whatever cause,
and will be described in the article on DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.Various causes combine to impair the normal performance of the gastric
functions in cancer of the stomach.Chronic catarrhal gastritis is a
factor in not a few cases.The destruction by the cancer of a certain
amount of secreting surface can be adduced as a sufficient cause only
in exceptional cases of extensive cancerous infiltration.Of more
importance is interference with the peristaltic movements of the
stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, where the cancer is most
frequently situated.As already mentioned, dilatation of the stomach is
a most important cause of indigestion in many cases.Of great interest
in this connection is the discovery by Von den Velden[38] that as a
rule (to which there are exceptions) the gastric juice in cases of
dilatation of the stomach due to cancer contains no free hydrochloric
acid, and that this gastric juice has comparatively feeble digestive
power, as proven by experiments.As this alteration of the gastric
juice interferes particularly with the digestion of albuminous
substances, it is explicable why many patients with gastric cancer have
an especial abhorrence for meat.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.During the progress of the disease the dyspeptic symptoms may improve,
but this improvement is usually only temporary.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer dyspeptic symptoms, as well as other gastric symptoms,
may be absent or not sufficiently marked to attract attention.Hiccough, sometimes very troublesome, has been observed not very
infrequently during the later periods of the disease.There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance of the tongue, which
is often clean and moist, but may be furred or abnormally red and dry.In the cachectic stage, toward the end of the disease, aphthous patches
{541} often appear on the tongue and buccal mucous membrane.An
increased flow of saliva has been occasionally observed in gastric
cancer as well as in other diseases of the stomach.Thirst is present
when there is profuse vomiting.Vomiting usually appears after other symptoms of indigestion have been
present for some time.It may, however, be one of the earliest symptoms
of the disease.At first of occasional occurrence, it increases in
frequency until in some cases it becomes the most prominent of all
symptoms.Vomiting may occur in paroxysms which last for several days
or weeks, and then this symptom may improve, perhaps to be renewed
again and again, with remissions of comparative comfort.There are rare
cases of gastric cancer in which the first symptom to attract attention
is uncontrollable vomiting, accompanied often with pain and rapid
emaciation.Such cases may run so acute a course that a fatal
termination is reached within one to two months.[39] In these cases,
which have been interpreted as acutely-developed gastric cancers, it is
probable that the cancer has remained latent for weeks or months before
it gave rise to marked symptoms.[Footnote 39: For example, Andral relates a case in which death took
place thirty-seven days after the onset of the symptoms, these being
obstinate vomiting, severe gastralgic paroxysms, marasmus, and, about
ten days before death, profuse black vomit.There was found a fungoid
tumor the size of a hen's egg projecting into the cavity of the stomach
near the pylorus.In this situation the walls of the stomach were
greatly thickened by colloid growth (_Arch.Here may also be mentioned the fact that in several instances pregnancy
has been complicated with gastric cancer.Here the uncontrollable
vomiting which often exists has been referred to the pregnancy, and has
led to the production of premature labor.]The situation of the cancer exerts great influence upon the frequency
of vomiting and the time of its occurrence after meals.When the cancer
involves the pyloric orifice, vomiting is rarely absent, and generally
occurs an hour or more after a meal.As this is the most frequent
situation of the cancer, it has been accepted as a general rule that
vomiting occurs at a longer interval after eating in cases of gastric
cancer than in cases of simple ulcer.But even with pyloric cancer the
vomiting may come on almost immediately after taking food, so that it
is not safe to diagnose the position of the cancer by the length of
time between eating and the occurrence of vomiting.As the cancer in
its growth obstructs more and more the pyloric orifice, the vomiting
acquires the peculiarities of that accompanying dilatation of the
stomach.The vomiting comes on longer after a meal--sometimes not until
twelve or twenty hours or even more have elapsed.It may be that
several days elapse between the acts of vomiting, which then present a
certain periodicity.The patient then vomits enormous quantities
containing undigested food, mucus, sarcinae, and gaseous and other
products of fermentation.Sometimes, especially toward the end of the
disease, the vomiting ceases altogether.This cessation has been
attributed to reopening of the pyloric orifice by sloughing of the
growth.It is not necessary to assume such an occurrence, as a similar
cessation of vomiting sometimes occurs in dilatation of the stomach due
to persistent stenosis of the pylorus.Cessation of vomiting in these
cases is by no means always a favorable symptom.Next to pyloric cancer, it is cancer involving the cardiac orifice
which is most frequently accompanied by vomiting.Here the vomiting
occurs often immediately after taking food, but there are exceptions to
this rule.{542} If in consequence of stenosis of the cardiac orifice
the food does not enter the stomach, it is shortly regurgitated
unchanged or mingled simply with mucus.It is this regurgitation rather
than actual vomiting which in most common and characteristic of cardiac
cancer.Even in cases in which the passage of an oesophageal sound
reveals no obstruction at the cardiac orifice it sometimes happens that
food, including even liquids, is regurgitated almost immediately, as in
a case reported by Ebstein in which cold water was returned at once
after swallowing.[40] In these cases Ebstein with great plausibility
refers the regurgitation to reflex spasm of the oesophagus induced by
irritation of a cancer at or near the cardia through contact of food or
liquids, especially when cold, with its surface.[Footnote 40: "Ueber den Magenkrebs," _Volkmann's Samml.When the cancer is seated in other parts of the stomach and it does not
obstruct the orifices, vomiting is more frequently absent or of only
rare occurrence.Vomiting is absent, according to Lebert, in one-fifth,
according to Brinton in about one-eighth, of the cases of gastric
cancer.Absence of vomiting is sufficiently frequent in gastric cancer
to guard one against excluding the diagnosis of this disease on this
ground alone.Although in many cases the vomiting of gastric cancer can be explained
on mechanical grounds by stenosis of the orifices, this is an
explanation not applicable to all cases.Mention has already been made
of spasm of the oesophagus as a cause of regurgitation of food in some
cases of cardiac cancer.A similar spasm of the muscle in the pyloric
region may explain the vomiting in certain cases in which during life
there were symptoms of pyloric stenosis, but after death no or slight
stenosis can be found.There is reason also to believe that atony of
the muscular coats of the stomach may cause stagnation of the contents
of the stomach and dilatation of the organ.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which the stomach is so intolerant as to reject food
almost immediately after its entrance a special irritability of the
nerves of the stomach must be assumed.It is customary to refer this
form of vomiting to irritation of the ulcerated surface of the cancer
by analogy with a similar irritability of the stomach observed in some
cases of simple gastric ulcer.But there is little analogy between the
ulcerated surface of a cancer in which tissues of little vitality and
irritability are exposed and the surface of a simple ulcer in which the
normal or slightly altered tissues of the stomach are laid bare.Finally, in the existence of chronic catarrhal gastritis is to be found
another cause of vomiting in many cases of gastric cancer.The presence of fragments of the cancer in the contents removed by
washing out the stomach with the stomach-tube has been observed by
Rosenbach[41] in three cases of gastric cancer, and utilized for
diagnostic purposes.A cancerous structure could be made out in these
fragments by the aid of the microscope.Hitherto, the presence of
particles of the tumor in the vomited matter has been considered as
hardly more than a curiosity, and I have not been able to find a
well-authenticated instance in which such particles in the vomit have
been recognized by microscopical examination.According to Rosenbach,
the fragments of the tumor in the washings from the stomach can be
recognized by the naked eye by the red, reddish-brown, or black specks
on their surface, due to recent or old hemorrhages which have aided in
the detachment of the fragments.{543} By this means such particles are
distinguished macroscopically from bits of food.By employing
soft-rubber tubes and the syphon process there is no danger, in washing
out of the stomach, of detaching pieces of the normal mucous membrane,
which, moreover, can be distinguished from the fragments of the tumor
by the aid of the microscope and usually by the naked eye.It remains
to be seen how frequently such fragments of the tumor are to be found
in the fluids obtained by washing out the stomach.It is not probable
that they will be found so often as Rosenbach anticipates.According to
the experience of most observers, they are very rarely present.They
would naturally be most readily detached from soft, fungoid, and
ulcerating cancerous growths.In this connection may also be mentioned
the occasional separation of bits of the tumor by the passage of the
stomach-tube in cases of cancer of the cardia.The eye of the tube as
well as the washings from the stomach should be carefully examined for
such particles.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric fluids in
dilatation of the stomach due to carcinoma of this organ was noted by
Von der Velden.[42] He found in eight cases of dilatation due to cancer
of the pylorus that the fluids removed by the stomach-pump were free
from hydrochloric acid, whereas in ten cases of dilatation due to other
causes, such as cicatrized simple ulcer of the pylorus, free
hydrochloric acid was only temporarily absent from the gastric juice.Von der Velden therefore attributes to the presence or the absence of
free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice in these cases great
diagnostic importance.The observations which have followed Von der
Velden's publication are not yet sufficient to justify us in drawing
positive conclusions in this matter.Recently, Kredel[43] has reported
from Riegel's clinic seventeen cases of simple dilatation in which free
hydrochloric acid was only exceptionally and temporarily absent from
the gastric fluids, and nineteen cases of cancerous dilatation in
which, with very rare exceptions, free hydrochloric acid was
continuously absent.Cases, however, have been observed by Ewald,
Seeman, and others in which free hydrochloric acid has been found in
stomachs dilated from gastric cancer.It is to be noted that free
hydrochloric acid is absent from the stomach in other conditions than
in gastrectasia due to cancer; of which conditions the most important
are fever, amyloid degeneration of the stomach (Edinger), and some
cases of gastric catarrh.Free hydrochloric acid is also usually absent
during the first twenty minutes to an hour after a meal.We have not
sufficient information as to the presence or absence of free
hydrochloric acid in cases of gastric cancer without dilatation of the
stomach.To Von der Velden's symptom no pathognomonic value can be
attached, but it may prove, in connection with other symptoms, an aid
in diagnosis.The presumption is against gastric cancer if free
hydrochloric acid be found continuously in a dilated stomach.Less
importance can be attached to the absence of free hydrochloric acid
unless the observations extend over several weeks and fever and amyloid
degeneration are excluded.[Footnote 42: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 43: _Zeitschrift f. klin.The tests for free hydrochloric acid are most satisfactorily applied to
the fluids withdrawn by the stomach-pump.After a sufficient quantity
for examination has been withdrawn the syphon process may be {544}
substituted.Tests may also be applied to vomited material, although
here the admixture of secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat may
render the results less conclusive.Edinger's method of swallowing bits
of sponge enclosed in gelatin capsules and attached to a string, by
which they can be withdrawn, may also be employed.The sponge should be
free from sand, deprived of alkaline carbonates by hydrochloric acid,
and rendered perfectly neutral by washing in distilled water.For clinical purposes the most convenient tests are those which depend
upon certain changes in color produced in reagents which enable us to
distinguish inorganic from organic acids.In the gastric juice the only
inorganic acid which comes into consideration is hydrochloric acid, and
the most important organic acid is lactic.Saturated aqueous solutions of tropaeolin, marked in the trade OO
(Von Miller, V. d. Velden).The solution should be perfectly clear and
of a lemon-yellow color.This solution is  red by the addition
of hydrochloric acid even in very dilute solution (0.01 per cent.).A
similar change in color is produced by lactic acid in somewhat less
dilute solution (0.06 per cent.), but the red color produced by lactic
acid disappears upon shaking with ether, while that produced by
hydrochloric acid remains, unless the acid was present in very minute
quantity.Tropaeolin is therefore a very delicate test for free acid in
general, but it does not distinguish so well as some other tests
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Aqueous solution of methyl-violet (an aniline dye) in the strength
of 0.025 per cent.The solution should be of a violet
color, and in a test-tube should allow the light to pass readily
through it.The addition of hydrochloric acid in dilute solution
changes the violet to a blue color, in stronger solution to a greenish
tint.With lactic acid in stronger solution methyl-violet gives a
similar but less distinct reaction.Methyl-violet, while a less
delicate test than tropaeolin, is better adapted for distinguishing
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Ferric chloride and carbolic acid test (Uffelmann).Mix 3 drops of
liquor ferri chloridi (German Pharmacopoeia, specific gravity 1482), 3
drops of very concentrated solution of carbolic acid, and 20 ccm.The addition of even very dilute solutions of lactic
acid (0.05 per cent.)changes the amethyst-blue color of this
test-fluid to a yellow color, with a shade of green.Dilute solutions
of hydrochloric acid produce a steel-gray, and stronger solutions a
complete decolorization of the fluid.When both hydrochloric and lactic
acids are present the effect of the lactic acid predominates unless
only a mere trace of it is present.This is therefore a good test for
lactic acid.It is necessary to prepare the test-fluid fresh each time
before using.It is well to test the digestive power of the filtered fluid from
the stomach by suspending in the fluid a floccule of washed fibrin and
keeping the fluid at a temperature of about 100 degrees F. If free
hydrochloric acid be present in moderate quantity, in a short time the
fibrin will begin to be dissolved, but if the acidity be due to organic
acid the fibrin will be dissolved very slowly or not at all.In applying these various tests the fluids from the stomach should be
filtered and the filtrate used.It is best not to rely upon a single
test, but to employ them in combination.The fluids may be mixed in a
test-tube.The reaction is sometimes most distinct when the fluids are
allowed {545} to mingle upon a white porcelain dish.It is sometimes of
advantage to concentrate the mingled fluids by evaporation.The fluid
obtained by the stomach-pump five or six hours after a meal is the most
suitable for diagnostic tests.The presence of peptones and of
dissolved albumen makes the tests less delicate for the gastric fluids
than for simple aqueous solutions of the acids.[44]

Velden, _loc.cit._; Uffelmann, _Deutsches Arch.431; Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.555; and Kredel, _loc.cit._]

It is important to distinguish between the slight and the copious
hemorrhages of gastric cancer.The admixture of a small quantity of blood with the vomit, giving to
the latter the so-called coffee-grounds appearance, is a very common
occurrence in gastric cancer.Melaenamesis, as the vomiting of brown or
black substance resembling coffee-grounds is called, is estimated to
occur in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the stomach.It is
observed particularly in the cachectic stage, in which it is not rare
for some brown or black sediment to be almost constantly present in the
vomit.The brown or black color is due to the conversion by the acids
of the stomach of the normal blood-coloring matter into dark-brown
haematin.The presence of blood in the vomited matter can generally be recognized
by the naked eye.By the aid of the microscope red blood-corpuscles,
more or less changed, especially decolorized red blood-corpuscles (the
so-called shadows), can usually be detected.Sometimes only amorphous
masses of altered blood-pigment can be seen.The spectroscope may also
be employed, in which alkaline solutions of haematin produce an
absorption-band between C and D, usually reaching or passing D. The
presence of blood-coloring matter can also be readily detected by the
production of haemin crystals.[45] The slight hemorrhages are in most
cases the result of ulceration of the cancer, by which process a little
oozing of blood from the capillaries is produced.[Footnote 45: Haemin crystals may be produced by boiling in a test-tube
a little of the suspected fluid or sediment with an excess of glacial
acetic acid and a few particles of common salt.After cooling, a drop
from the lower layers will show under the microscope the dark-brown
rhombic crystals of haemin in case blood-coloring matter was present in
not too minute quantity.]Copious hemorrhages from the stomach are not common in gastric cancer.They occur probably in not over 12 per cent.According to Lebert, they are more liable to occur in males than in
females.Blood vomited in large quantity is either bright red or more
or less darkened in color according to the length of its sojourn in the
stomach.Following profuse haematemesis, some dark, tarry blood is
usually passed by the stools, constituting the symptom called melaena.Copious hemorrhages from the stomach hasten the fatal termination and
may be its immediate forerunner.Cases of gastric cancer have been
reported in which death has occurred from gastrorrhagia before there
has been time for any blood to be either vomited or voided by stool.As
might naturally be expected, patients with gastric cancer do not
usually rally as readily from the effects of gastric hemorrhage as do
most patients with simple ulcer.Profuse gastric hemorrhage, if it
occur, is most common in the late stage of gastric cancer, but I have
known a {546} case of cancer of the stomach in which copious
haematemesis was the first symptom, with the exception of slight
dyspepsia.[46]

[Footnote 46: In a case of cancer of the lesser curvature observed by
Laborie fatal haematemesis occurred before there had been any distinct
symptoms of gastric cancer (Bouchut, _Nouv.Profuse haematemesis is more common with soft cancers than with other
forms.The source of profuse hemorrhage is in some large vessel eroded
by the ulcerative process.The same vessels may be the source of the
bleeding as have been enumerated in connection with gastric ulcer.Cancers situated near the pylorus or on the lesser curvature are the
most likely to cause severe hemorrhage.While it is true that coffee-grounds vomiting is most common in cancer,
and profuse haematemesis is most common in ulcer of the stomach, it is
important to remember that either disease may be attended by that form
of hemorrhage which is most common in the other.Dysphagia is one of the most important symptoms of cancer of the
cardia.Dysphagia is sometimes one of the first symptoms to attract
attention, but it may not appear until late in the disease.It is
usually accompanied with painful sensations near the xiphoid cartilage
or behind the sternum, or sometimes in the pharynx.The sensation of
stoppage of the food is usually felt lower down than in ordinary cases
of stenosis of the oesophagus.Stenosis of the cardia can be
appreciated by the passage of an oesophageal bougie, but it is
important to bear in mind that dysphagia may exist in cases of cancer
of the cardia in which the oesophageal bougie does not reveal evidence
of stenosis.Dysphagia may be a prominent symptom in cancer occupying
parts of the stomach remote from the cardia.[47] The dysphagia here
considered is not likely to be confounded with the difficulty in
swallowing which is due to weakness or to aphthous inflammation of the
throat and gullet, which often attends the last days of gastric cancer.[Footnote 47: A case in point has been reported by J. B. S. Jackson.The cancer occupied the pyloric region (_American Journ.Sci._,
April, 1852, p.From a diagnostic point of view the presence of a tumor is the most
important symptom of gastric cancer.In the absence of tumor the
diagnosis of gastric cancer can rarely be made with positiveness.A
tumor of the stomach can be felt in about 80 per cent.of the cases of
cancer of the stomach (Brinton, Lebert).With all of its importance, it
is nevertheless possible to exaggerate the diagnostic value of this
symptom.It is by no means always easy to determine whether an existing
tumor belongs to the stomach or not, and even if there is proved to be
a tumor of the stomach, there may be difficulty in deciding whether or
not it is a cancer.Many instances might be cited in which errors in
these respects have been made by experienced diagnosticians.The value
of tumor as a diagnostic symptom is somewhat lessened by the fact that
it often does not appear until comparatively late in the disease, so
that the diagnosis remains in doubt for a long time.It is to be
remembered also that tumor is absent in no less than one-fifth of the
cases of gastric cancer.In order to understand in what situations cancers of the stomach are
likely to produce palpable tumors, it is necessary to have in mind
certain points concerning the situation and the relations of this
organ.The stomach is placed obliquely in the left hypochondrium and the
epigastric regions of the abdomen, approaching the vertical more nearly
{547} than the horizontal position.The mesial plane of the body passes
through the pyloric portion of the stomach, so that, according to
Luschka, five-sixths of the stomach lie to the left of this plane.The
most fixed part of the stomach is the cardiac orifice, which lies
behind the left seventh costal cartilage, near the sternum, and is
overlapped by the left extremity of the liver.The pyloric orifice lies
usually in the sagittal plane passing through the right margin of the
sternum, and on a level with the inner extremity of the right eighth
costal cartilage.The pylorus is less fixed than the cardia.When the
stomach is empty the pylorus is to be found in the median line of the
body; when the stomach is greatly distended the pylorus may be pushed
two and a half to three inches to the right of the median line.The
pylorus is overlapped by a part of the liver, usually the lobus
quadratus or the umbilical fissure.About two-thirds of the stomach lie
in the left hypochondrium covered in by the ribs, and to the left and
posteriorly by the spleen.The highest point of the stomach is the top
of the fundus, which usually reaches to the left fifth rib.The lowest
point of the stomach is in the convexity of the greater curvature to
the left of the median line.The lower border of the stomach varies in
position more than any other part of the organ.In the median line this
border is situated on the average about midway between the base of the
xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, but within the limits of health it
may extend nearly to the umbilicus.The lesser curvature in the greater
part of its course extends from the cardia downward to the left of the
vertebral column and nearly parallel with it.The lesser curvature then
crosses to the right side on a level with the inner extremity of the
eighth rib, and in the median line lies about two and a half fingers'
breadth above the lower margin of the stomach.The lesser curvature and
the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the stomach are covered by
the left lobe of the liver.It follows from this description that only the lower part of the
anterior surface of the stomach is in contact with the anterior
abdominal walls.This part in contact with the anterior abdominal walls
corresponds to a part of the body and of the pyloric region of the
stomach, and belongs to the epigastric region.The remainder of the
stomach is covered either by the liver or by the ribs, so that in the
normal condition it cannot be explored by palpation.It is now evident that tumors in certain parts of the stomach can be
readily detected by palpation, whereas tumors in other parts of the
organ can be detected only with difficulty or not at all.Cancer of the
cardia cannot be felt by palpation of the abdomen unless the tumor
extends down upon the body of the stomach.Cancers of the fundus, the
lesser curvature, and the posterior wall of the stomach often escape
detection by palpation, but if they are of large size or if the stomach
becomes displaced by their growth, they may be felt.Cancerous tumors
of the anterior wall or of the greater curvature are rare, but they can
be detected even when of small size, unless there are special obstacles
to the physical examination of the abdomen.Cancerous tumors of the
pylorus can be made out by palpation in the majority of cases
notwithstanding the overlapping of this part by the liver.The pyloric
tumor may be so large as to project from beneath the border of the
liver, or the hand may be pressed beneath this border so that the tumor
can be felt, or, what is most frequently the {548} case, the weight of
the tumor or the distension of the stomach drags the pylorus downward.The pylorus may, however, be so fixed by adhesions underneath the
liver, or the liver may be so enlarged, that tumors of this part cannot
be reached by palpation.The situation in which cancerous tumors of the pylorus can be felt
varies considerably.The usual situation is in the lower part of the
epigastric region, a little to the right of the median line, but it is
almost as common for these tumors to be felt in the umbilical region,
and it is not rare for them to appear to the left of the median
line.[48] Brinton states that the tumor is in the umbilical region more
frequently in the female sex than in the male, in consequence of the
compression exercised by corsets.Occasionally pyloric cancers produce
tumors in the right hypochondrium.Exceptionally, pyloric tumors have
been felt as low as the iliac crest or even in the hypogastric region.[Footnote 48: According to Jackson and Tyson, pyloric cancers are felt
more frequently to the left than to the right of the median line.]Cancers of the stomach do not usually attain a very large size.An important criterion of
cancerous tumors of the stomach is their gradual increase in size by
progressive growth.The consistence of cancerous tumors of the stomach is nearly always
hard, as appreciated by palpation through the abdominal walls.The
surface of the tumor is usually nodulated or irregular, but
exceptionally it is smooth.The tumor may be movable or not, but in the
majority of cases it is rendered immovable by adhesions.Mobility of
the tumor, however, does not exclude the presence of adhesions.The
tumor sometimes follows the respiratory movements of the diaphragm,
especially when it is adherent to this structure or to the liver, but
more frequently the tumor is not affected or but slightly affected by
the movements of the diaphragm.If the tumor is not fixed by adhesions,
it may change its position somewhat according to the varying degrees of
distension of the stomach or in consequence of pressure of intestine
distended with gas or feces.In consequence of these movements or of an
overlying distended colon the tumor may even disappear temporarily.It
is possible that the tumor may lessen or disappear in consequence of
sloughing of the growth.[49] It is not rare for a certain amount of
pulsation to be communicated to the growth by the subjacent aorta.This
pulsation is most common with pyloric tumors.[Footnote 49: Symptoms which have been considered as diagnostic of
sloughing of stenosing cancers of the pylorus are diminution in the
size of the tumor, alleviation of the vomiting, hemorrhage, replacement
of obstinate constipation by diarrhoeal stools which often contain
blood, increased pain after eating, and rapid progress of cachexia.]The percussion note over the tumor is usually tympanitic dulness.Sometimes there is very little alteration over the tumor of the normal
tympanitic note belonging to the stomach; on the other hand,
exceptionally there is absolute flatness over the tumor.It is often of assistance in determining that a tumor belongs to the
pylorus to find dilatation of the stomach.An abnormal fulness of the
epigastric and umbilical regions may then be observed, and through the
abdominal walls, if thin, may be seen the peristaltic movements of the
stomach.Other signs and symptoms aid in the diagnosis of dilatation of
the stomach, and will be described in connection with this disease.{549} It is to be noted that what one takes to be the primary tumor of
the stomach is not so very rarely a secondary cancerous mass in the
stomach or in adjacent lymph-glands or in the peritoneum.Such nodules
may also increase the apparent size of the original tumor.As has been
pointed out by Rosenbach,[50] spasm of the muscular coat near a cancer
or an ulcer of the stomach may produce a false tumor or enlarge a real
tumor.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The cancer, instead of appearing as a circumscribed tumor, may
infiltrate diffusely the gastric walls, and so escape detection.When
the greater part or the whole of the stomach is the seat of this
diffuse cancerous infiltration, a sense of abnormal resistance may be
appreciated by palpation in the epigastric region.In these cases the
stomach is often much shrunken in size.The outlines of the thickened
organ can sometimes be made out, but the physical signs do not suffice
for the diagnosis of cancer.With cancer of the cardia there is usually more or less atrophy of the
stomach, which is manifested by sinking in of the epigastric region.Sometimes the tumor eludes discovery on account of special obstacles to
the physical examination of the abdomen, such as a thick layer of fat
in the abdominal walls or a large quantity of ascitic fluid.Every aid
in the physical examination of the abdomen should be resorted to.The
patient should be examined while lying on his back with the utmost
possible relaxation of the abdominal walls.If necessary, he should
also be examined while standing or in the knee-elbow position.Sometimes a deep inspiration will force down a previously concealed
tumor.The emptying of a dilated stomach by means of a stomach-tube
will sometimes bring to prominence a gastric tumor.The inflation of the stomach by the development in it of carbonic acid
gas may render valuable assistance in the diagnosis of tumors of this
organ and of surrounding parts.This method has been recommended by W.
Ph.H. Wagner among others, and especially by Rosenbach.[51] From 20 to
30 grains of bicarbonate of soda and from 15 to 20 grains of tartaric
acid may be introduced into the stomach.The soda, dissolved in
lukewarm water, may be given first and followed by the acid in
solution, or, better, the mixed powders may be swallowed in the dry
state and followed by a tumblerful of water.Some persons require a
larger quantity of the powder in order to inflate the stomach.Occasionally the introduction of the effervescing powder fails to
produce any appreciable distension of the stomach.This negative result
may be due to the escape of the gas into the intestine in consequence
of incontinence of the pylorus--a condition which Ebstein[52] has
observed and described especially in connection with pyloric cancer.When this pyloric insufficiency exists the resulting tympanitic
distension of the intestine is a hindrance to palpation of tumors of
the stomach.Failure to secure distension of the stomach is not always
due to this cause.It may be necessary to make repeated trials of the
effervescing mixture.It is well to have a stomach-tube at hand to
evacuate the gas if this should cause much distress.H. Wagner, _Ueber die Percussion des Magens nach
Auftreibung mit Kohlensaure_, Marburg, 1869; O. Rosenbach, _Deutsche
med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.[Footnote 52: W. Ebstein, _Volkmann's Samml.In some respects simpler and more easily controlled is the method of
{550} distending the stomach by injecting air into it through a
stomach-tube, as recommended by Runeberg.[53] For this purpose the
balloon of a Richardson's spray apparatus may be attached to a
soft-rubber stomach-tube.In this way the desired quantity of air can
be introduced and at any time allowed to escape through the tube.[Footnote 53: J. W. Runeberg, _Deutsches Arch.When the stomach has been inflated the contours of tumors of the
pylorus often become surprisingly distinct in consequence of the
changes in the position and the shape of the stomach.When the tumor is
fixed by adhesions, it may be possible to follow the contours of the
stomach into those of the tumor.False tumors produced by spasm of the
muscular walls of the stomach may be made to disappear by this
distension of the organ.This procedure enables one to distinguish
between tumors behind and those in front of the stomach, as the former
become indistinct or disappear when the stomach is inflated.By
bringing out the contours of the stomach the relations of the tumor to
surrounding organs may be rendered for the first time clear.Assistance
in diagnosis may also be afforded by distension of the colon with water
or with gas or with air, per rectum, in order to determine the course
of the colon and its relations to abdominal tumors (Mader, Ziemssen,
Runeberg).A manifest contraindication to distension of the stomach or
of the colon with gas exists if there is a suspicion that the coats of
these parts are so thinned by ulceration that they might rupture from
the distending force of the gas.There have been no cases recorded
where such an accident has happened.Only in exceptional cases are the bowels regular throughout the course
of gastric cancer.Constipation is the rule, and not infrequently there
is obstinate constipation.This is to be expected when the patient eats
little and vomits a great deal, or when there is stenosis of the
pylorus.In cancer, as in many other diseases of the stomach, the
peristaltic movements of the intestine are inclined to be sluggish.Occasional diarrhoea is also common in gastric cancer, being present,
according to Tripier,[54] at some period or other in over one-half the
cases.Constipation often gives place to diarrhoea during the last
months or during the last days of life.In other periods of the disease
diarrhoea not infrequently alternates with constipation.In rare cases
diarrhoea is an early symptom, and it may be present exceptionally
throughout the greater part of the disease.The irritation of
undigested food sometimes explains the diarrhoea.When diarrhoea is
persistent there probably exists catarrhal inflammation of the large
intestine, or in some instances there may be diphtheritic and
ulcerative inflammation of the colon, causing dysenteric symptoms
during the last stages of cancer of the stomach.[Footnote 54: "Etude clinique sur la Diarrhee dans le Cancer de
l'Estomac," _Lyon Med._, 1881, Nos.Black stools containing altered blood occur for some days after profuse
gastric hemorrhage.It is important to examine the stools for blood, as
bleeding may occur from cancer of the stomach without any vomiting of
blood.There is no change in the urine characteristic of gastric cancer.Deposits of urates are not uncommon.If there be profuse vomiting or
frequent washing out of the stomach, the urine often becomes alkaline
from fixed {551} alkali.[55] The amount of urea is diminished in
consequence of the slight activity of the nutritive processes of the
body.Rommelaere attaches unmerited diagnostic importance to this
diminution of urea.A similar diminution of urea occurs in other like
states of depressed nutrition.[Footnote 55: According to Quincke, when the acid in the stomach is not
hydrochloric acid, but organic acid resulting from fermentation, then
vomiting and washing out the stomach do not reduce the acidity of the
urine (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Albuminuria does not belong to the history of gastric cancer, although
a small quantity of albumen may be present in the urine as in other
anaemic and cachectic conditions.A larger quantity of albumen may be
due to parenchymatous and fatty degeneration of the kidney or to
chronic diffuse nephritis, which are infrequent but recognized
complications of gastric cancer.There is often an excess of indican in
the urine, to which, however, no diagnostic significance can be
attached.The urine in gastric cancer sometimes contains an excess of aceton, or
at least of some substance which yields aceton upon the application of
various tests.This so-called acetonuria is present without any
symptoms referable to it, so far as we know.Allied to this so-called
acetonuria is that condition of the urine in which it is 
burgundy-red upon the addition of ferric chloride in solution
(Gerhardt's reaction).It is not positively known what substance
imparts this last reaction to the urine.V. Jaksch, who has studied the
subject industriously, believes that the red coloring substance is
diacetic acid, and he proposes to call the condition diaceturia.Fresh
urine, which shows in a marked degree Gerhardt's reaction, often has a
peculiar aromatic, fruity odor, as has also the expired air.Gerhardt's
reaction has been studied mostly in diabetic urine, but it occurs
sometimes in cases of gastric cancer and in a variety of diseases.This
so-called diaceturia may be associated with a peculiar form of coma,
but it is oftener observed without any symptoms referable to it[56]
(see page 555).[Footnote 56: The various tests for aceton in the urine are not
altogether satisfactory.They are to be found in an article by Von
Jaksch in the _Zeitschrift f. klin.For
English readers a good abstract of an article by Penzoldt on these
tests and on acetonaemia in general is to be found in _The Medical
News_ of Philadelphia, Aug.162, but this does not consider
the corrections and additions to be found in V. Jaksch's article cited
above.Acetonuria has been observed especially in diabetes mellitus,
fevers, carcinoma, and dyspepsia.The substance which produces Gerhardt's reaction is to be distinguished
from other substances which may be present in the urine and give a red
color with ferric chloride--first, by the fact that boiling the urine
in a test-tube for five or six minutes destroys the first-named
substance, or causes the red color to disappear in case this has been
produced by ferric chloride; and, secondly, by the fact that ether
extracts the substance from acidified urine, and that the red color
produced in the ether extract by ferric chloride (it may be necessary
to first neutralize the acid) fades away in the course of a few days
(V. Jaksch, _Zeitschrift f. Heilkunde_, Bd.Urines which
respond to Gerhardt's reaction in a marked degree yield aceton on
distillation, but aceton or an aceton-yielding substance may be present
in considerable quantity without response of the urine to Gerhardt's
test.]Disorders of nutrition embrace an important group of symptoms, such as
loss of flesh and strength, impoverished blood, and cachectic color of
the skin.Emaciation and debility are sometimes the first symptoms of
gastric cancer to attract attention, and often the first symptoms to
arouse anxiety.More frequently these symptoms of disordered nutrition
first appear after dyspeptic ailments or pain have existed for several
weeks or months.It may aid in the diagnosis of gastric cancer to weigh
the patient {552} from time to time, as carcinoma is generally attended
by progressive loss of weight.The patient frequently becomes morose and depressed in spirits.His
strength fails, sometimes disproportionately to the loss of flesh.There is no disease in which emaciation becomes more extreme than in
cases of gastric cancer.In many cases profound anaemia develops, and sometimes in such a degree
that this symptom cannot be regarded always as simply co-ordinate with
the other disorders of nutrition, but is to be regarded rather as an
evidence of some special disturbance of the blood-forming organs.The
blood may present the same changes as are observed in pernicious
anaemia, such as extreme reduction in the number of red
blood-corpuscles (to one million or even half that number in a cubic
millimeter) and manifold deformed shapes of the corpuscles
(poikilocytosis).In extreme cases the proportion of haemoglobin in the
blood may be reduced to 50 or 60 per cent.[57]
There is occasionally a moderate increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles.In one case of gastric cancer I observed a
leucocytosis in which there was one white to twenty red
blood-corpuscles without enlargement of the spleen.[58]

[Footnote 57: The granular disintegrating corpuscles
(Zerfallskorperchen of Riess) may also be found in the blood in
considerable number.Leichtenstern has observed that toward the end of
life the relative proportion of haemoglobin in the blood may be
increased, sometimes rapidly, and may even exceed the normal limit.This is due to concentration of the blood in consequence of the loss of
water.In such cases the tissues appear abnormally dry and the blood
thick and tarry at the autopsy (_Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.It seems to me proper to distinguish two kinds of anaemia in gastric
cancer--a simple anaemia, which is present in the majority of cases,
and can be explained by the development of the cancer and the
disturbance of the gastric functions; and a pernicious anaemia, which
is present only in exceptional cases, and has the typical symptoms of
progressive pernicious anaemia.][Footnote 58: In a case of large medullary cancer of the stomach
reported by H. Mayer there was one white to fifty red blood-corpuscles.The spleen was not enlarged (Bayer, _Aerztl.Intelligenzblatt_, 1870,
No.A similar case is related by Lebert, in which, however, the
spleen was enlarged (_op.To the pallor of anaemia is added often a faded yellowish tint of the
skin which is considered characteristic of the cancerous cachexia.At
the same time, the skin is frequently dry and harsh, and may present
brownish spots (chloasma cachecticorum).The pallid lips, the pale
greenish-yellow color of the face, the furrowed lines, and the pinched
and despondent expression make up a characteristic physiognomy, which,
however, is neither peculiar to gastric cancer nor present in all cases
of the disease.There is no cachectic appearance which is pathognomonic
of cancer; and in this connection it is well to note that there are
cases of gastric ulcer, and particularly of non-cancerous stenosis of
the pylorus, in which all of the symptoms described as peculiar to the
cancerous cachexia are met with.Nevertheless, the weight of these
symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric cancer should not be
underestimated.There is no disease in which profound cachectic
symptoms so frequently and so rapidly develop as in gastric cancer.The profound nutritive disturbances of gastric cancer are referable
partly to the cancer as such, and partly to the impairment of the
functions of the stomach.It is impossible to separate the effects of
these two sets of causes, and distinguish, as some have done, a
cachexia of cancer {553} and a cachexia of inanition.It is the
combination of these causes which renders the cachexia of cancer of the
stomach so common, so rapid in its development, and so profound as
compared with that of cancer in other situations.The relation of
cancer in general to cachexia need not here be discussed, save to say
that there is the best ground for believing that the cachexia is
directly dependent upon the growth and metamorphoses of the primary
cancer and its metastases, and that there is not reason to assume any
dyscrasia antedating the cancerous formation.While the failure of the general health and the gastric symptoms in
general develop side by side, it is especially significant of gastric
cancer when the symptoms of impaired nutrition are more pronounced than
can be explained by the local gastric disturbance.When, however, as
sometimes happens, gastric symptoms are absent or no more than can be
explained by anaemia and marasmus, then in the absence of tumor a
positive diagnosis is impossible.Such cases of gastric cancer during
life often pass for essential or pernicious anaemia.Otherwise,
unexplained symptoms of anaemia with emaciation and debility,
particularly in elderly people, should lead to a careful search for
gastric cancer.Finally, it is necessary to add that there are exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which there is no emaciation, and in which the
general health appears to be astonishingly well preserved.In most of
these cases death occurs either from some accident of the disease or
from some complication.Slight or moderate oedema about the ankles is a common symptom during
the cachectic stage of gastric cancer.This oedema is due to hydraemia.This cachectic dropsy in rare cases becomes excessive and leads to
anasarca, with serous effusion in the peritoneal, pleural, and
pericardial sacs.Such cases are liable to be mistaken for heart
disease, particularly as a haemic murmur often coexists, or for
Bright's disease.Ascites may be the result not only of hydraemia, but
also of cancerous peritonitis or of pressure on the portal vein by
cancer.Many cases of gastric cancer associated with ascites have been
falsely diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver, and sometimes the
distinction is extremely difficult or impossible.During the greater part of the disease the pulse is usually normal;
toward the end it is not infrequently rapid, small, and compressible.In consequence of weakness and anaemia any exertion may suffice to
increase the frequency of the pulse, and may induce palpitation of the
heart and syncope.As might be expected as the result of anaemia, haemic murmurs in the
heart and blood-vessels are not rare in gastric cancer.Epigastric pulsation is often very prominent in cases of gastric
cancer, as it may be in various other conditions.This pulsation is
sometimes of a paroxysmal nature.Venous thrombosis is not a rare complication in the last stages of
gastric cancer.It is most common in the femoral and saphenous veins,
and is rapidly followed by painful oedematous swelling of the affected
extremity.Thrombosis of the subclavian and axillary veins is much less
frequent.When it occurs there are the same symptoms of phlegmasia alba
dolens in the upper extremity as have been mentioned for the lower.Lebert has recorded a case of thrombosis of the right external jugular
{554} vein.[59] The thrombosis is the result of marasmus, and therefore
may occur in other gastric diseases besides gastric cancer, so that
this symptom has not all the diagnostic importance for gastric cancer
claimed by Trousseau.Being an evidence of great weakness of the
circulation, marantic thrombosis in cancer of the stomach is of grave
prognostic import.The temperature is often normal throughout the course of gastric
cancer.Febrile attacks, however, are not uncommon in this disease.Elevation of temperature may occur without any complication to explain
it.During the second half of the disease there may be either irregular
febrile attacks or a more continuous fever, which is, however, usually
of a light grade, the temperature not generally exceeding 102 degrees.Lebert describes a light and a hectic
carcinomatous fever.There may be subnormal temperature with collapse during the last days
of life, and in general anaemia and inactivity of nutritive processes
tend to produce a low temperature.Dyspnoea on slight exertion may be present in gastric cancer as a
result of anaemia or of fatty heart.In a few cases of gastric cancer
have been observed symptoms pointing to a reflex vagus neurosis, such
as paroxysms of dyspnoea, oppression in the chest, and palpitation of
the heart, but these symptoms are less common in gastric cancer than in
some other diseases of the stomach.Watson[60] relates a case of
gastric cancer in which increasing dyspnoea and palpitation were such
prominent symptoms that he was led to diagnose fatty heart with portal
congestion as the sole trouble.At the autopsy the heart and lungs were
found healthy, but there was extensive cancer of the greater curvature
of the stomach.He subsequently ascertained that there had been
symptoms pointing to gastric disease.[Footnote 60: Sir T. Watson, _Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Physic_, vol.The various complications of gastric cancer which affect the
respiratory organs will be considered later.Depression of spirits, lack of energy, headache, neuralgia,
sleeplessness, and vertigo are functional nervous disturbances which
are often the result of disordered digestion from whatever cause, and
are therefore not uncommon in gastric cancer.The theory that these
symptoms are due to the absorption of noxious substances produced in
the stomach and intestine by abnormal digestive processes is
plausible,[61] and more intelligible than reference to some undefined
sympathy between the digestive organs and the nervous system.[Footnote 61: This theory is elaborated by Senator ("Ueber
Selbstinfection durch abnorme Zersetzungsvorgange, etc.," _Zeitschrift
f. klin.The intelligence is generally not impaired in the course of gastric
cancer.Considerable interest belongs to coma as a symptom of cancer of the
stomach, and more particularly to the occurrence of coma with the
peculiar characters which have been described by Kussmaul as
distinguishing diabetic coma.[62] The most distinctive feature in
Kussmaul's group of symptoms is the accompaniment of the coma by a
peculiar {555} dyspnoea in which, without evidence of disease of the
lungs or air-passages, the respirations are strong and deep and often
attended with a groaning sound in expiration.The breathing is either
normal in frequency or oftener moderately increased.The temperature is not much elevated, and
sometimes is much below the normal.Sometimes the coma is preceded by a
period of excitement, with restlessness, and perhaps with screaming.Gerhardt's reaction in the urine may or may not be present.When it is
present in a marked degree there is often an aromatic, chloroform-like
odor to the breath and to the fresh urine.The patient may come out of
the coma, but in the vast majority of cases the coma terminates
fatally.[Footnote 62: _Deutsches Arch.It is now known that this dyspnoeic coma is not confined to diabetes
mellitus, but that it occurs also in gastric cancer and in various
other diseases.[63] Its occurrence in gastric cancer is rare.In this
disease it does not usually appear until anaemia is far advanced, but
it may occur in cases of cancer in which the patient's general health
and nutrition are still fairly good.I recently made the post-mortem
examination of an elderly man, fairly well nourished, who was found in
the streets comatose and brought in this condition to Bellevue
Hospital, where he died in about twelve hours.While in the hospital
his breathing was increased in frequency, forcible, and deep.The urine contained a small quantity of
albumen, but no sugar.At the autopsy was found a large, soft, ulcerated
cancer of the lesser curvature and posterior wall of the stomach near
the pylorus.The kidneys, brain, heart, and other organs were
essentially healthy.[Footnote 63: Von Jaksch was the first to describe this form of coma in
cancer of the stomach (_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, pp.He adopted the term coma carcinomatosum, and more recently coma
diaceticum.L. Riess has reported seventeen cases of this coma
occurring in a variety of diseases, such as pernicious anaemia, gastric
cancer, gastric ulcer, tuberculosis, which all had in common profound
anaemia.He proposes the term dyspnoeic coma (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Senator has described two
cases of gastric cancer with this coma.He uses the terms dyscrasic
coma and Kussmaul's group of symptoms (_ibid._, Bd.In the
cases described by Litten under the name coma dyspepticum, dyspnoea was
absent, but Gerhardt's reaction in the urine was present.In Litten's
cases structural disease of the stomach was not supposed to be present.The patients recovered from the coma (_ibid._, Suppl.We possess no satisfactory explanation of this form of coma.In
diabetes it is considered to be due to the presence in the blood of
some intoxicating agent.For a time this agent was thought to be
aceton; it is now believed by Von Jaksch to be diacetic acid.Much
stress has been laid upon the aromatic, fruity odor of the breath and
of the fresh urine, and upon the presence of some substance in the
urine which imparts to it a burgundy-red color upon the addition of
liquor ferri chloridi (Gerhardt's reaction.See changes in the urine,
page 551).Although the whole aceton question is at present in a very
confused state, there is no proof that aceton or its allies possesses
the toxic properties assumed by this theory;[64] and it is certain that
dyspnoeic coma may occur in diabetes and in other diseases without the
presence of Gerhardt's reaction in the urine.It is also true that this
reaction often occurs without any clinical symptoms referable to it.Riess and Senator believe that in non-diabetic {556} cases anaemia is
the most important factor in the production of this coma.[65]

[Footnote 64: Frerichs, _Zeitschrift f. klin.[Footnote 65: Riess refers the coma to the anaemia as such, whereas
Senator thinks that, in consequence of the depraved nutrition of the
body resulting from the anaemia, some toxic substance is developed
which enters the circulation.]Coma, probably belonging to this same variety, may occur in gastric
cancer without the peculiar dyspnoea which has been described.There is
reason to believe that this dyspnoea is not a necessary symptom of the
so-called diabetic coma.Chronic Bright's disease terminating with uraemic coma is an occasional
but not frequent complication of gastric cancer.Coma and other cerebral symptoms may be produced by secondary cancerous
tumors in the brain.Stupor deepening into coma may develop during the often-prolonged
death-agony of gastric cancer.The distribution, origin, and frequency of cancerous growths secondary
to gastric cancer are most conveniently considered under Pathological
Anatomy.Symptoms referable to certain localizations of these secondary
cancerous deposits, however, are so common, and so interwoven with the
clinical history of cancer of the stomach, that it is desirable to
consider some of these symptoms in the present connection.Cancer of the liver is the most important of these secondary cancerous
growths.It is estimated to be present in nearly one-third of the cases
of gastric cancer, but by no means in all these cases does it produce
symptoms.As a rule, the earlier hepatic cancer forms in the course of
gastric cancer the more likely is it to be attended by symptoms.The
most important symptoms of secondary cancer of the liver are
enlargement of the liver, peritoneal exudation, and persistent icterus.When nodular growths can be felt in the free border or surface of the
liver, the diagnosis is generally easily established.Sometimes the
liver remains of normal size or is even contracted, and then the
diagnosis is difficult or impossible.Ascites or exudative peritonitis
is present in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the liver.It is only persistent jaundice
which aids in the diagnosis of hepatic cancer.The various combinations of gastric cancer with secondary hepatic
cancer may be clinically grouped as follows:

1.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Symptoms of gastric cancer with latent hepatic cancer.Symptoms of gastric cancer followed by symptoms of hepatic cancer.Symptoms both of gastric cancer and of hepatic cancer present when
the case comes under observation.Symptoms of hepatic cancer with latent gastric cancer.Symptoms of hepatic cancer followed by symptoms of gastric cancer.Symptoms of anaemia and
marasmus, or of chronic exudative peritonitis, or of chronic pleurisy.From this grouping it is evident that the existence of secondary
hepatic cancer may aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, or
may mislead, or may be without influence.The greatest assistance in
diagnosis is rendered when the physical signs and the symptoms of
hepatic {557} cancer develop some time after the appearance of gastric
symptoms which may previously have been equivocal.Much more difficult
to diagnosticate are the cases of hepatic cancer accompanied or
followed by gastric symptoms, inasmuch as cancer of the liver, whether
primary or secondary, may be attended with marked disturbance of the
gastric functions, including haematemesis.In these cases, unless a
tumor of the stomach can be discovered, a positive diagnosis of gastric
cancer is impossible.In view of the infrequency of primary cancer of
the liver, however, there will be in many of these cases a strong
probability in favor of primary cancer of the stomach.When it is
remembered that over one-third of the cancers of the liver are
secondary to cancer of the stomach, it is evident that in cases which
appear to be primary hepatic cancer very careful attention should be
given to the exploration of the stomach.But even then diagnostic
errors will often be unavoidable.Cancer of the peritoneum secondary to cancer of the stomach may produce
no symptoms, and so pass unrecognized.The diagnosis of peritoneal
cancer is readily made when, after the recognition of gastric cancer,
secondary cancerous nodules in the peritoneum can be felt through the
abdominal walls or through the vagina.There are cases of gastric
cancer in which the symptoms are all referable to secondary cancer of
the peritoneum.Cancer of the peritoneum is usually attended with fluid
exudation in the peritoneal cavity.The chemical and the microscopical
examination of this fluid withdrawn by paracentesis may aid in the
diagnosis of cancerous peritonitis.Whereas in dropsical accumulations
in the peritoneal cavity the quantity of albumen in the fluid is
usually less than 2-1/2 per cent., in cancerous peritonitis there is
usually from 3 to 4 per cent.of albumen, the percentage rarely falling
as low as 2-1/2 per cent., but sometimes being as high as from 5 to 6
per cent.The percentage of albumen in ordinary peritonitis is usually
over 4.[66] Clumps of cancer-cells are sometimes to be found by
microscopical examination of the fluid.These cells are large,
epithelioid in shape, and often contain vacuoles and fatty granules.It
is only when these cells are arranged in clumps or as so-called budding
cells, and when they are present in abundance, that they are
diagnostic.They are to be sought especially in fibrinous coagula.They
are present only when the cancerous alveoli actually communicate with
the peritoneal cavity.[67] The development of cancerous nodules in the
margins of an opening made in the abdominal walls by a trocar is also
evidence of cancerous disease of the peritoneum.The same thickening
and retraction of the mesentery and omentum may occur in cancerous as
in tuberculous peritonitis.In both the exudation is often hemorrhagic.[Footnote 66: The conditions under which the estimation of the quantity
of albumen in the peritoneal exudation may prove of diagnostic aid are
fully considered by Runeberg (_Deutsches Arch.Here also are given methods for making this analysis for
clinical purposes.][Footnote 67: The literature on this subject is as follows: Foulis,
_Brit.2, 1878; Thornton, _ibid._, Sept.7,
1878; Quincke, _Deutsches Arch.580;
Ehrlich, _Charite Annalen_, vii.226; Brieger, _ibid._, viii.]Importance has been attached to enlargement of the supraclavicular
lymphatic glands in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, but there
are so many causes of enlargement of these glands that not much
significance can be attached to this symptom, which, moreover, is
absent in most {558} cases.Still, under certain circumstances this
glandular enlargement may aid in the diagnosis.The same remarks apply
to enlargement of the inguinal glands, which is a common occurrence in
case cancer involves the peritoneum.One must not mistake abnormal
prominence of the lymphatic glands in consequence of emaciation for
actual enlargement.Gastric cancer much less frequently than gastric ulcer causes
perforation of the stomach.Of 507 cases of gastric cancer collected by
Brinton, perforation into the general peritoneal cavity occurred in 17
(3-1/3 per cent.).[68] In two cases of gastric cancer reported by Ellis
perforative peritonitis was preceded by symptoms supposed to be only
those of ordinary dyspepsia, hemorrhage and vomiting being absent.[69]
Various fistulous communications like those described under gastric
ulcer may be the result of perforation of gastric cancer, but with the
exception of gastro-colic fistula they are much more frequently
produced by ulcer than by cancer.In 160 cases of gastric cancer
collected by Dittrich, gastro-colic fistula existed in 6 (3-3/4 per
cent.).[70] In 507 cases collected by Brinton this fistula existed in
11 (2.17 per cent.).In Lange's 210 cases gastro-colic fistula existed
in 8 (3.8 per cent.).Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were caused by cancerous ulceration.[71] The symptoms
characteristic of fistulous communication between the stomach and the
colon are the vomiting of fecal matter and the passage of undigested
food by the stools.These symptoms are not present in all cases, so
that a diagnosis is not always possible.Fecal vomiting is influenced
by the size of the opening between the stomach and the colon.With
great obstruction at the pylorus, fecal vomiting, as might be expected,
is absent or infrequent, while the passage of undigested food by the
bowels is common.Under these circumstances vomiting is sometimes
relieved after the establishment of the fistula.Aid may be afforded in
the diagnosis of gastro-colic fistula by the introduction into the
rectum or into the stomach of  or other easily recognizable
substances, and determining their presence in the vomit or in the
stools in consequence of their escape by the unnatural outlet.V.
Ziemssen has determined in a case of gastro-colic fistula due to cancer
the escape into the stomach of carbonic acid gas artificially generated
in the rectum, with failure to obtain distension of the colon.[72] A
number of instances of gastro-cutaneous fistula due to gastric cancer
have been recorded, but this form of fistula is much less common than
gastro-colic fistula, and much less frequently the result of cancer
than of ulcer of the stomach.Subcutaneous emphysema may precede the
formation of the fistula.Other gastric fistulous communications
resulting from cancer, such as with the pleura, the lungs, the small
intestine, are too infrequent to merit consideration under the
symptomatology of the disease.cit._) records in 210 cases of
gastric cancer 12 perforations into the peritoneal cavity (5.7 per
cent.).][Footnote 70: _Prager Vierteljahrsch._, vol.[Footnote 72: _Deutsches Arch.He
recommends for extreme distension of the colon in an adult the
introduction, by means of a tube passed up the rectum, of a solution of
about 5 drachms of sodii bicarb.and 4-1/2 drachms of tartaric
acid--injected not all at once, but in three or four doses at intervals
of a few minutes, the tube being cleaned in the intervals by the
injection of three ounces of water, so as to avoid generation of gas in
the tube.The generation of a smaller quantity of gas would suffice for
the purpose here in view.]{559} As a rule, patients with gastric cancer die from gradual
exhaustion.In a condition of extreme emaciation and feebleness the
patient sinks into a state of collapse, accompanied often with stupor,
sometimes with mild delirium.The death-agony is prolonged frequently
from twelve to twenty-four hours, and sometimes even longer.On the
other hand, death may occur somewhat suddenly in the last stages of
gastric cancer, and without satisfactory explanation.Death from copious gastric hemorrhage does not occur probably in more
than 1 per cent.In the rare cases of death from perforation of the stomach the patient
is sometimes so exhausted at the time of perforation that the
occurrence of this accident remains unrecognized in the absence of any
complaint of characteristic symptoms.The coma which sometimes leads to the fatal termination of gastric
cancer has already been sufficiently considered.Finally, death may be the result of certain complications more or less
dependent upon the cancer.Of these the most important are suppurative
peritonitis and pulmonary complications, particularly oedema, terminal
pneumonia, and embolism of the pulmonary artery.DURATION.--It is evidently impossible to determine the exact duration
of a cancer of the stomach.Doubtless in all cases there is a period of
growth of the tumor before it produces symptoms, and the duration of
this latent period can never be determined.When symptoms appear they
are often at first so mild as to be readily overlooked, and so
ambiguous that even if recognized they are not clearly referable to the
cancer.Gastric symptoms may have preceded, perhaps for years, the
development of the cancer, so as to lead to the assumption of a longer
duration of the cancer than is really the case.Estimates, therefore,
of the duration of gastric cancer can be only of limited value.From 198 cases Brinton[73] estimates the average duration of gastric
cancer as about twelve and a half months, the maximum duration as about
thirty-six months, and the minimum as one month.From 36 cases
Katzenellenbogen[74] estimates the average duration as eighteen months,
the maximum as five years and five months, the minimum as one month.From 112 cases Lebert[75] makes the average duration fifteen months and
the maximum four years.of the cases Lebert found the
duration less than three months, in 62 per cent.between six and
eighteen months, in 42 per cent.between six and twelve months, in 17
per cent.between three and six months, and in the same number of cases
between eighteen months and four years.cit._]

[Footnote 74: _Op.cit._]

[Footnote 75: _Op.cit._]

Estimates of several years' duration (such as nine years in the case of
Napoleon) are to be received with scepticism.In these cases symptoms
of gastralgia or of dyspepsia or of gastric ulcer have preceded the
development of the cancer.It has already been mentioned that cancer
may develop in a simple ulcer of the stomach.Mathieu,[76] from an analysis of 27 cases of gastric cancer occurring
under thirty-four years, found the average duration in early life to be
only three months.In only 2 out of 19 cases did the duration exceed
one year.Although this analysis is based upon too small a number of
cases, there {560} seems to be no doubt that gastric cancer pursues a
more rapid course in early life than it does in old people.[Footnote 76: _Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884, p.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric cancer have been
mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice may appear in the course of
gastric cancer from a variety of causes, such as catarrhal
gastro-duodenitis, impaction of gall-stones in the common bile-duct,
and pressure on the bile-duct by cancerous growths in the pancreas, in
the portal lymphatic glands, or in the liver itself.Pylethrombosis,
which is likely to be suppurative, is a rare complication.In a case of
cancer of the anterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach
reported by Wickham Legg[77] the symptoms seem to have been mostly
referable to a complicating suppurative pylethrombosis.Simple and
cancerous pylethromboses also occur.Other forms of peritonitis than
the cancerous may complicate gastric cancer, such as suppurative,
sero-fibrinous, and chronic proliferative peritonitis.Catarrhal
enteritis, and particularly diphtheritic colitis, are not infrequent
complications, especially in the later stages of the disease.Chronic
diffuse nephritis, both in the form of the large and of the small
kidney, is a rare complication of cancer of the stomach.Hydrothorax,
sero-fibrinous pleurisy, and emphysema may develop either with or
without cancerous invasion of the pleura.Pericarditis is much less
common; it is most likely to occur with cancer of the cardia.Pyo-pneumothorax, abscess, and gangrene of the lung may result from
perforation of the pleura or of the lung by gastric cancer.Oedema of
the lungs, splenization, and pneumonia, involving usually the lower
lobes, are common in the last days of gastric cancer.Emboli derived
from venous thrombi are sometimes carried into the pulmonary artery or
its branches.Although much has been written as to the exclusion of
tuberculosis by cancer, no such law exists.Both old and fresh
tubercles have been repeatedly observed in cases of gastric cancer.Reference has already been made to the frequent development of aphthae
in the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus in the final stage of gastric
cancer.Fatty degeneration of the heart may develop in gastric cancer
as in other anaemic states.Phlegmasia alba dolens has already been
mentioned.It is not probable that insanity is to be regarded as more
than an accidental complication of gastric cancer; still, it has been
noticed in several cases--for instance, of Dittrich's 160 cases, 5
patients were insane, 2 with violent mania.Amyloid degeneration has
been present in some cases.Purpura haemorrhagica has been present in a
few instances in the later stages (cachectic purpura).Chronic
catarrhal gastritis and dilatation of the stomach are less
complications than a part of the disease.The relation of cancer to
simple ulcer of the stomach has already been considered.The various
secondary cancerous deposits are most conveniently considered under the
Morbid Anatomy.It is to be remarked that many of the complications of
gastric cancer--as, for instance, pneumonia and peritonitis--may have a
very obscure clinical history, as they often occur when the patient is
greatly prostrated.MORBID ANATOMY.--The following table gives the situation of the tumor
in 1300 cases of cancer of the stomach:[78] {561}

  Pyloric region.791  60.8%
  Lesser curvature.148  11.4%
  Cardia.104   8.0%
  Posterior wall.68   5.2%
  The whole or the greater
    part of the stomach.61   4.7%
  Multiple tumors.45   3.5%
  Greater curvature.34   2.6%
  Anterior wall.30   2.3%
  Fundus.19   1.5%

From this table it appears that three-fifths of all gastric cancers
occupy the pyloric region, but it is not to be understood that in all
of these cases the pylorus itself is involved.In four-fifths of the
cases the comparatively small segment of the stomach represented by the
cardia, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region is the part
affected by gastric cancer.The lesser curvature and the anterior and
the posterior walls are involved more frequently than appears from the
table, inasmuch as many cancers assigned to the pyloric region extend
to these parts.The fundus is the least frequent seat of cancer.In the
cases classified as involving the greater part of the stomach the
fundus often escapes.[Footnote 78: These cases are collected from the following sources:
Lebert, _op.cit._; Prague statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Wrany, and
Eppinger, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _op.cit._; and Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._ Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter assign to the class of cancers involving the whole
stomach all cases which they found designated simply as carcinoma
ventriculi without further description.This produces in their
statistics an excessive number of cancers under this class.I have
preferred, therefore, to estimate in their collection of cases the
number of cancers involving the whole stomach, according to the
percentage for this class obtained from the other authors above cited.]As was shown by Rokitansky, it is the exception for cancer of the
pylorus to extend into the duodenum, whereas cancer of the cardia
usually invades for a certain distance the oesophagus.The varieties of carcinoma which develop primarily in the stomach are
scirrhous, medullary, colloid, and cylindrical epithelial
carcinoma.[79] The distinction between scirrhous and medullary cancer
is based upon the difference in consistence, the former being hard and
the latter soft.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma cannot be recognized as
such by the naked eye.It presents usually the gross appearances of
medullary cancer.Soft cancer (including both cylindrical-celled
epithelioma and medullary carcinoma) is the most frequent form of
gastric cancer.Next in frequency is scirrhous cancer, and then comes
colloid cancer, which, although not rare, is much less frequent than
the other varieties.[Footnote 79: I have not been able to find an authentic instance of
primary melanotic cancer of the stomach, although this form is included
by most authors in the list of primary gastric cancers.It is known
that most cases formerly described as melanotic cancers are melanotic
sarcomata, which originate usually in the skin or the eye and are
accompanied frequently with abundant metastases.Secondary melanotic
tumors have been several times found in the stomach.They were present
in 7 out of 50 cases of melanotic cancer (or sarcoma) analyzed by
Eiselt, although out of 104 cases not a single primary melanotic cancer
occurred in the stomach (_Prager Viertaljahrschr._, vol.The list of secondary melanotic sarcomata of the stomach might be still
further increased.Of course gastric cancers  by pigment from
old blood-extravasations should not be confounded with melanotic
tumors.]As all degrees of combination and of transition exist between the
different forms of cancer, and as a large number of cancers of the
stomach are of a medium consistence and would be classified by some
observers as scirrhous and by others as medullary, statistics as to the
relative frequency of the different varieties have very little value.Moreover, in most statistics upon this point there is no evidence that
simple fibrous growths have not been confounded with scirrhous cancer,
and as a rule {562} little or no account is taken of cylindrical-celled
epithelioma, which is a common form of gastric cancer--according to
Cornil and Ranvier, the most common.[80]

[Footnote 80: For any who may be interested in such statistics I have
collected 1221 cases of gastric cancer, of which 791 (64.8 per cent.)were medullary, 399 (32.7 per cent.)scirrhous, and 31 (2.5 per cent.)22 cases described as epithelial have been included with the
medullary; 29 cases described as fibro-medullary, and 1 as
fasciculated, have been included with the scirrhous.The cases are from
the previously-cited statistics of Lebert, Dittrich, Wrany, Eppinger,
Gussenbauer, and V. Winiwarter, and from Fenger (_Virchow u. Hirsch's
Jahresbericht_, 1874, Bd.Cancer of the stomach may grow in the form of a more or less complete
ring around the circumference of the stomach, or as a circumscribed
tumor projecting into the cavity of the stomach, or as a diffuse
infiltration of the walls of the stomach.The annular form of growth is
observed most frequently in the pyloric region.Cancerous tumors which
project into the interior of the stomach are sometimes broad and
flattened, sometimes fungoid in shape, but most frequently they appear
as round or oval, more rarely irregular, crater-like ulcers, with
thickened, prominent walls and ragged floor.The free surface of the
tumor presents sometimes a cauliflower-like or dendritic appearance,
which characterizes the so-called villous cancer.Diffuse cancerous
infiltration is seated oftenest in the right half of the stomach, but
it may occupy the cardiac region or even the entire stomach.The relation of the cancerous growth to the coats of the stomach varies
in different cases.The tumor usually begins in the mucous membrane and
rapidly extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucous coat.In this lax connective-tissue coat the tumor spreads often more rapidly
than in the mucous membrane, so that it may appear as if the cancer
originated in the submucosa.The mucous membrane, however, is usually
invaded, sooner or later, over the whole extent of the tumor.The dense
muscular coat offers more resistance to the invasion of the tumor.Cancerous masses, however, penetrate along the connective-tissue septa
between the muscular bundles, which often increase in number and size.In the muscular coat thus thickened can be seen the opaque white
fibrous and cancerous septa enclosing the grayish, translucent bundles
of smooth muscular tissue.Often, however, the whole muscular coat
beneath the tumor is replaced by the cancerous growth, and can no
longer be recognized.The serous and subserous connective tissue, like
the submucous coat, offers a favorable soil for the growth of the
tumor, which here appears usually in the form of large and small
nodules projecting from the peritoneum.Adhesions now form between the
stomach and surrounding parts, and opportunity is offered for the
continuous growth of the cancer into these parts.In the manner
described the tumor grows in all directions, sometimes more in depth,
sometimes more laterally, sometimes more into the interior of the
stomach.Ulceration occurs in all forms of gastric cancer.[81] The ulceration is
caused either by fatty degeneration and molecular disintegration of the
surface of the tumor or by the separation of sloughy masses.Doubtless
the solvent action of the gastric juice aids in the process.The softer
and {563} the more rapid the growth of the cancer, the more extensive
is likely to be the ulcer.Such ulcers are usually round or oval in
shape, but their contours may be irregular from the coalescence of two
or more ulcers or from serpiginous growth.The edges are usually high,
soft in consistence, and often beset with polypoid excrescences.The
floor is generally sloughy and soft, and often presents warty
outgrowths.The edges and floor may, however, be hard and smooth.In
the more slowly-growing scirrhous and colloid cancers the ulcers are
more likely to be superficial.Partial cicatrization of cancerous
ulcers may take place.The development of cicatricial tissue may
destroy the cancerous elements to such an extent that only by careful
microscopical examination can the distinction be made between cancer
and simple ulcer or fibroid induration.The examination of secondary
cancerous deposits in adjacent lymphatic glands or other parts becomes,
then, an important aid in the diagnosis.[Footnote 81: Ulceration was present in 60 per cent.of Lebert's cases,
and in 66-1/2 per cent.of Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's pyloric
cancers.]Suppuration has been known to occur in gastric cancers, but it is
extremely rare.Each form of gastric cancer has certain peculiarities which require
separate consideration.Medullary carcinoma grows more rapidly than the other varieties of
cancer.It forms usually soft masses, which project into the stomach
and are prone to break down in the centre and develop into the
crater-like ulcers already described.All of the coats of the stomach
are rapidly invaded by the growth.The consistence of the tumor is
soft, the color upon section whitish or reddish-gray, sometimes over a
considerable extent hemorrhagic.Milky juice can be freely scraped from
the cut surface of the tumor.The so-called villous cancer and the
haematodes fungus are varieties of medullary carcinoma.Medullary
carcinoma is more frequently accompanied by metastases than the other
forms.In consequence of its tendency to deep ulceration medullary
cancer is more liable to give rise to hemorrhage and to perforation
than is scirrhous or colloid cancer.The continuous new formation of
cancerous tissue in the floor of the ulcer and the formation of
adhesions, however, greatly lessen the danger of perforation into the
peritoneal cavity.Histologically, medullary cancer is composed of a scanty stroma of
connective tissue enclosing an abundance of cancerous alveoli filled
with polyhedrical or cylindrical epithelial cells.The stroma is often
richly infiltrated with lymphoid cells, and contains blood-vessels
which often present irregular dilatations of their lumen.Waldeyer describes with much detail, for this as for the other forms of
gastric cancer, the origin of the tumor from the gastric tubules.According to his description, a group of gastric tubules, ten to twenty
in number, sends prolongations downward into the submucous coat.These
tubular prolongations are filled with proliferating epithelial cells,
which make their way into the lymphatic spaces of the surrounding
tissue and give origin to the cells in the cancerous alveoli.A
small-celled infiltration of the surrounding connective tissue
accompanies this growth of the tubules.The tissue beneath and at the margins of medullary cancer may be
predominantly fibrous in texture and contain comparatively few
cancerous alveoli.This scirrhous base is often exposed after the
destruction of the greater part of the soft cancer by ulceration and
sloughing.It is {564} probable that many of the scirrhous cancers are
formed in this way secondarily to medullary cancer (Ziegler).Cylindrical-celled epithelioma presents the same gross appearances and
the same tendency to ulceration and to the formation of metastases
which characterize medullary cancer.The consistence of cylindrical
epithelioma may, however, be firm like that of scirrhus.Not
infrequently the alveoli are distended with mucus secreted by the
lining epithelium, and then the tumor presents in whole or in part
appearances similar to colloid cancer.Upon microscopical examination are seen spaces resembling more or less
closely sections of tubular glands.These spaces are lined with
columnar epithelium.Often in certain parts of the tumor the alveolar
spaces are filled with cells, so that the structure is a combination of
that of ordinary cancer and of epithelioma.The stroma is generally
scanty and rich in cells, but it may be abundant.Cysts may be present
in this form of tumor, and in one case I have found such cysts nearly
filled with papillary growths covered with cylindrical epithelium, so
that the appearance resembled closely that of the so-called proliferous
cysto-sarcoma of the breast.The origin of cylindrical epithelioma from the gastric tubules is
generally accepted, and is more readily demonstrable than the similar
origin claimed for the other forms of gastric cancer.Scirrhous cancer assumes often the form of a diffuse thickening and
induration of the gastric walls, particularly in the pyloric region,
where it causes stenosis of the pyloric orifice.Scirrhus may, however,
appear as a circumscribed tumor.Irregular hard nodules frequently
project from diffuse scirrhous growths into the interior of the
stomach.Scirrhous cancer and medullary cancer are often combined with
each other.The dense consistence of scirrhous cancer is due to the predominance of
the fibrous stroma, the cancerous alveoli being relatively small in
size and few in number.Colloid cancer generally appears as a more or less uniform thickening
of the gastric walls.All of the coats of the stomach are converted
into the colloid growth.Nearly the whole of the stomach may be invaded
by the new growth.[82] The tumor has a tendency to spread to the omenta
and to the rest of the peritoneum, where it may form enormous masses,
but it rarely gives rise to metastases in the interior of organs.Colloid cancer may, however, form a circumscribed projecting tumor in
the stomach, and in rare instances it causes abundant secondary colloid
deposits in the liver, the lungs, and other parts.[Footnote 82: In a case reported by Storer the whole stomach, except a
little of the left extremity over an extent of about an inch, was
converted into a colloid mass in which no trace of the normal coats of
the stomach could be made out.The colloid growth replacing the gastric
wall measured seven-eighths of an inch in thickness in the pyloric
region.Digestion was less disturbed in this case than in most cases of
gastric cancer (_Boston Med.In
Amidon's case (reported in the _Trans.38) there seems to have been an equally extensive colloid
metamorphosis of the stomach.]Colloid cancer presents, even to the naked eye, an exquisite alveolar
structure, whence the name alveolar cancer as a designation of this
tumor.Bands of opaque white or gray connective tissue enclose alveolar
meshes which are filled with the gelatinous, pellucid colloid {565}
substance.This colloid material is thought to be produced by a colloid
transformation of the epithelial cells in the alveoli, but the same
transformation seems to occur also in the stroma.Few or no intact
epithelial cells may be found in the alveoli.Colloid metamorphosis may
take place in all forms of gastric cancer, but it is particularly
common in cylindrical epithelioma.Colloid cancer may originate in the
peritoneum unconnected with any glandular structures.It occurs often
at an earlier age than other forms of cancer.Deep ulceration rarely
attacks colloid cancer.Flat-celled epithelioma is found at the cardiac orifice and as a
metastatic growth in other parts of the stomach.Originating in the
oesophagus, it may extend downward into the stomach.By noting whether
the structure is that of squamous or of cylindrical epithelioma it is
often possible to determine whether a tumor at the cardiac orifice
originates in the oesophagus or in the stomach.Secondary cancer of the stomach, although rare, is not such a curiosity
as is often represented.Without aiming at completeness, I have been
able to collect 37 cases of secondary cancer of the stomach, of which
the larger number will stand critical examination.[83] Of these cases,
17 were secondary to cancer of the breast, 8 to cancer of the
oesophagus, 3 to cancer of the mouth or nose, and the remainder to
cancer of other parts of the body.The large number of cases secondary
to cancer of the breast is explained by the large statistics relating
to mammary cancer which were consulted.Gastric cancer is more
frequently secondary to cancer of the oesophagus than to cancer of any
other part.In this category of course are not included cases of
continuous growth of oesophageal cancer into the stomach, but only
metastatic cancers of the stomach.A part at least of the gastric
cancers secondary to cancer of the alimentary tract above the stomach I
refer, with Klebs, to implantation in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of cancerous particles detached from the primary growth in the
oesophagus, pharynx, or mouth.This view is supported by the absence in
some cases of any involvement of the lymphatic glands.The secondary
deposits in the stomach conform in structure to the primary growth.They are usually situated in the submucous coat, where they form one or
often several distinctly circumscribed tumors.The secondary tumors may
or may not ulcerate.[Footnote 83: These cases are from Dittrich, 2 (the remainder of his
cases I rejected); Cohnheim, 1; Petri, 2; Klebs, 3; Lucke, 1; Weigert,
1; Coupland, 1; Cruse, 1; Hausmann, 1; Bartholow, 1; Oldekop, 5; Edes,
1; V. Torok and V. Wittelshofer, 8; Grawitz, 4; Haren Noman, 5.So-called melanotic cancers, cancers involving only the serous coat of
the stomach, and those extending by continuous growth into the stomach,
are not included in this list.]Primary cancers may be present at the same time in different organs of
the body; for instance, in the uterus and in the stomach.[84] The
possibility of multiple primary cancers is to be borne in mind in
considering some of the apparently secondary cancers of the stomach, as
well as in determining whether certain cancers are secondary to gastric
cancer or not.Here the microscopical examination is often
decisive.[85]

[Footnote 84: Case of A. Clark's (_Trans.260), and a similar one reported by J. B. S. Jackson in _Extr.[Footnote 85: The subject of multiple primary cancers is considered by
Kauffmann (_Virchow's Arch._, Bd.317), and by Beck (_Prager
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, Nos.V. Winiwarter reports a
cancer of the stomach in a patient who died one year seven and a half
months after extirpation of a cancer of the nose.He regards the case
as one of multiple primary cancer.]{566} Gastric cancer often causes important secondary changes in the
coats and the lumen of the stomach.In the neighborhood of the tumor
are often found hypertrophy of the muscular coat and fibrous thickening
of the submucous coat.Polypoid hypertrophy of the mucous membrane near
the cancer is not rare.Not only near the tumor, but over the whole
stomach, chronic catarrhal gastritis usually exists.The most important alterations are those dependent upon obstruction of
the orifices of the stomach.This obstruction may be caused either by a
tumor encroaching upon the orifice or by an annular thickening of the
walls of the orifices.Even without apparent stenosis, destruction of
the muscular layer at or near the pylorus may be an obstacle to the
propulsion of the gastric contents into the duodenum.As a result of
obstruction of the pyloric orifice the stomach becomes dilated,
sometimes enormously, so as to occupy most of the abdominal cavity.The
walls of the dilated stomach, particularly the muscular coat, are
usually thickened, but exceptionally they are thinned.Sometimes with
pyloric stenosis the stomach is reduced in size.This occurs
particularly when a scirrhous growth extends diffusely from the pyloric
region over a considerable part of the stomach.Obstruction of the
cardiac orifice or in the oesophagus leads to atrophy of the stomach,
although here also there are exceptions.Above the obstruction the
oesophagus is often dilated.An existing obstruction may be reduced or
removed by ulceration or sloughing of the tumor.Both dilatation and contraction of the stomach may attend gastric
cancer without any involvement of the orifices of the stomach in the
cancerous growth.The cavity of the stomach may be so shrunken by
scirrhous thickening and contraction of the gastric walls that it will
hardly contain a hen's egg.Irregular deformities in the shape of the
stomach, such as an hour-glass shape and diverticular recesses, may be
caused by gastric cancer.Changes in the shape of the stomach and the weight of the tumor may
cause displacements of pyloric cancers, so that these tumors have been
found in nearly all regions of the abdomen, and even in the true
pelvis.[86] Such displaced cancers usually contract adhesions with
surrounding parts.[Footnote 86: Lebert, _op.It is not necessary to dwell upon the formation of adhesions which may
bind the stomach to nearly all of the abdominal organs, most frequently
to the liver, the pancreas, the intestine, and the anterior abdominal
wall.Adhesions of pyloric cancers are found in at least two-thirds of
the cases, and probably oftener.[87]

[Footnote 87: Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter found adhesions recorded in
370 out of 542 pyloric cancers.In considering the propriety of
resection of gastric cancers it has become a matter of importance to
know in what proportion of cases adhesions are present.I agree with
Ledderhose and with Rydygier in believing that adhesions are present
oftener than appears from Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's statistics.The fact that adhesions are not noted in post-mortem records of gastric
cancer cannot be considered proof of their absence.Little has been
done in the study of gastric cancer from a surgical point of view.Metastases and adhesions were absent in only 5 out of 52 cases of
pyloric cancer in which either pylorectomy or exploratory laparotomy
was performed (Rydygier).]Cancer of the stomach in the majority of cases is accompanied with
{567} metastases in other parts of the body.In 1120 cases of gastric
cancer secondary cancers were present in 710, or 63.4 per cent., and
absent in 410, or 36.6 per cent.[88] In about two-thirds of the cases,
therefore, secondary deposits were present.[Footnote 88: These cases are from Habershon, _op.i.; and Gussenbauer and Von
Winiwarter, _loc.cit._]

In order to determine the relative frequency of the secondary deposits
in various organs of the body, I have constructed the following table,
based upon an analysis of 1574 cases of cancer of the stomach in which
the situation of the metastases were given:[89]

  Lymphatic glands.551  35.0%
  Liver.475  30.2%
  Peritoneum, omentum, and intestine.357  22.7%
  Pancreas.122   7.8%
  Pleura and lung.98   6.2%
  Spleen.26   1.7%
  Brain and meninges.9   0.6%
  Other parts of the body.92   5.8%

[Footnote 89: These cases include, in addition to those cited in the
preceding foot-note, those of Dittrich (_Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.), Wrany (_ibid._, vols.Metastases in the intestine formed only
a small number of those under the heading peritoneum, omentum, and
intestine, but as they were all included together in Gussenbauer's
large statistics, the intestinal metastases could not well be placed
separately.In 673 cases the peritoneum and omentum were cancerous in
21.7 per cent.]Secondary cancerous deposits are probably even more frequent in the
lymphatic glands than appears from the table.In 1153 cases of gastric
cancer in which the situation of the affected lymphatic glands is
specified, the abdominal glands, and chiefly those near the stomach,
were the seat of cancer in 32-1/2 per cent.In Lange's 210 cases the
cervical glands were affected in 4.3 per cent.In other statistics this
percentage is much smaller.In nearly one-third of the cases there are
secondary cancers in the liver.These may attain an enormous size in
comparison with the tumor of the stomach.Cancer of the peritoneum and
of the omentum is found in about one-fifth of the cases of gastric
cancer.The spleen is rarely involved, except by continuous growth of a
cancer of the fundus or in cases of widespread distribution of cancer
through the aortic circulation.Cancer of the liver increases the
liability to metastases in the lungs, but the latter may be present
without any cancerous deposits in the liver.Secondary cancers may be
present in the suprarenal capsules, the kidneys, the ovaries, the
heart, the thoracic duct, the bones, the skin, etc.In an interesting
case reported by Finlay[90] the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk was
thickly studded with small nodules, of which two were excised during
life and found to be cylindrical epitheliomata.This led to the
diagnosis of a primary tumor of the same nature in the stomach or in
the intestine.At the autopsy was found a cylindrical epithelioma of
the stomach which had not given rise to characteristic symptoms.Secondary cancer of the intestine is rare if the deposits in the
peritoneal coat be {568} excepted.Several cancerous ulcers or multiple
cancerous nodules may be found along the intestinal tract, involving
the mucous and the submucous coats.[91] These metastases seem best
explained by the theory of implantation of cancerous elements which
have been carried from the primary growth in the stomach into the
intestine.In some of the cases the idea of multiple primary cancers
may also be entertained.Unfortunately, in Roseler's case of multiple skin-cancers with an
ulcerated cancer of the stomach no microscopical examination of the
skin-nodules was made.The interpretation of this case is therefore
doubtful (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.[Footnote 91: Cases in point are recorded by Wrany (_loc.cit._), Blix
(_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1876, ii.207), Lange,
Katzenellenbogen, and Lebert.]It is not rare for gastric cancer to cause secondary deposits in the
stomach itself.Sometimes it is difficult to decide which of two or
more cancers in the stomach is the primary growth, as in Ripley's case
of ulcerated cancer of the cardiac orifice with a similar growth around
the pyloric orifice.[92] It is probable that in very rare instances
multiple primary cancers may develop in the stomach.[Footnote 92: J. H. Ripley, _Trans.Maurizio has also reported a case of scirrhous cancer of the cardia
with scirrhous cancer of the pylorus (_Annal.di Medicina_, Oct.,
1869).A similar case was observed by Barth (_Gaz.hebdom._, 1856, No.Cancerous metastases are produced by the transportation of cancerous
elements by the lymphatic current or by the blood-current.In a number
of instances the portal vein or some of the branches which help to form
it have been found plugged with a cancerous mass which may or may not
be organized.[93] The cancer in these cases has burst through the walls
of the vessel into the lumen, where it may grow both in the direction
and against the direction of the current.On serous surfaces, and
probably also, although rarely, on mucous surfaces, secondary cancers
may develop from cancerous particles detached from a parent tumor and
scattered over the surface as a kind of seminium.[Footnote 93: Cases of this kind have been reported with especial
fulness by Spaeth (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.432), Acker
(_Deutsches Arch.173), and Audibert (_De la
Generalisation du Cancer de l'Estomac_, Paris, Thesis, 1877).]Mention has already been made of the invasion of parts adjacent to the
stomach by the continuous growth of gastric cancer.In this way
lymphatic glands, the liver, the pancreas, the omenta, the transverse
colon, the spleen, the diaphragm, the anterior abdominal wall, the
vertebrae, the spinal cord and membranes, and other parts may be
involved in the cancerous growth.Under the head of Complications reference has already been made to
various lesions which may be associated with gastric cancer.As regards
the manifold complications caused by perforation of gastric cancer, in
addition to what has already been said the article on gastric ulcer may
be consulted.In general, the various fistulous communications caused
by gastric cancer are less direct than those produced by gastric ulcer.The wasting of various organs of the body in cases of gastric cancer
may be found on post-mortem examination to be extreme.Habershon
mentions a case in which the heart of a woman forty years old weighed
only 3-1/2 ounces after death from cancer of the pylorus.As in other
profoundly anaemic states, the embryonic or lymphoid alteration of the
marrow of the bones is often present in gastric cancer.PATHENOGENESIS.--The problems relating to the ultimate causation and
origin of gastric cancer belong to the pathenogenesis of cancer in
general.Our knowledge with reference to these points is purely
hypothetical.It will suffice in this connection simply to call
attention to {569} Virchow's doctrine, that cancer develops most
frequently as the result of abnormal or of physiological irritation,
hence in the stomach most frequently at the orifices; and to Cohnheim's
theory, that cancer as well as other non-infectious tumors originate in
abnormalities in development, more specifically in persistent embryonic
cells.According to the latter view, gastric cancer develops only in
those whose stomachs from the time of birth contain such embryonic
remnants.These unused embryonic cells may lie dormant throughout life
or they may be incited to cancerous growth by irritation, senile
changes, etc.According to Cohnheim's theory, the orifices of the
stomach are the most frequent seat of cancer on account of complexity
in the development of these parts.For a full consideration of these theories the reader is referred to
the section of this work on General Pathology.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of a recognizable tumor in the region of the
stomach outweighs in diagnostic value all other symptoms of gastric
cancer.The detection of fragments of cancer in the vomit or in
washings from the stomach is of equal diagnostic significance, but of
rare applicability.The discovery of secondary cancers in the liver, in
the peritoneum, or in lymphatic glands may render valuable aid in
diagnosis.Of the local gastric symptoms, coffee-ground vomiting is the
most important.The relation between the local and the general symptoms
may shed much light upon the case.While anorexia, indigestion,
vomiting, and epigastric pain and tenderness point to the existence of
a gastric affection, the malignant character of the affection may be
surmised by the development of anaemia, emaciation, and cachexia more
rapid and more profound than can be explained solely by the local
gastric symptoms.The value to be attached in the diagnosis of gastric
cancer to the absence of free hydrochloric acid from the contents of
the stomach must still be left sub judice.The age of the patient, the
duration, and the course of the disease are circumstances which are
also to be considered in making the diagnosis of gastric cancer.These
symptoms of gastric cancer have already been fully considered with
reference to their presence and absence and to their diagnostic
features.It remains to call attention to the differential diagnosis between
gastric cancer and certain diseases with which it is likely to be
confounded.The points of contrast which are to be adduced relate
mostly to the intensity and the frequency of certain symptoms.There is
not a symptom or any combination of symptoms of gastric cancer which
may not occur in other diseases.Hence the diagnosis is reached by a
balancing of probabilities, and not by any positive proof.Notwithstanding these difficulties, gastric cancer is diagnosed
correctly in the great majority of cases, although often not until a
late stage of the disease.Errors in diagnosis, however, are
unavoidable, not only in cases in which the symptoms are ambiguous or
misleading, but also in cases in which all the symptoms of gastric
cancer, including gastric hemorrhage and tumor, are present, and still
no gastric cancer exists.Cases of the latter variety are of course
rare.In the absence of tumor the diseases for which gastric cancer is most
liable to be mistaken are gastric ulcer and chronic gastric catarrh.In
the following table are given the main points of contrast between these
three diseases: {570}

{571} The diagnosis between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer is more
difficult than that between cancer and gastritis, and sometimes the
diagnosis is impossible.The differential points mentioned in the table
are of very unequal value.An age under thirty, profuse hemorrhage, and
absence of tumor are the most important points in favor of ulcer;
tumor, advanced age, and coffee-ground vomiting continued for weeks are
the most important points in favor of cancer.As cancer may have been
preceded by ulcer or chronic gastritis for years, it is evidently
unsafe to trust too much to the duration of the illness.As has already
been said, it is best to place no reliance in the differential
diagnosis upon the character of the pain.Any peculiarities of the
vomiting, the appetite, or the digestion are of little importance in
the differential diagnosis.Cachexia is of more importance, but it is
to be remembered that ulcer, and even chronic gastritis in rare
instances, may be attended by a cachexia indistinguishable from that of
cancer.Cases might be cited in which very decided temporary
improvement in the symptoms has been brought about in the course of
gastric cancer, so that too much stress should not be laid upon this
point.Enough has been said under the Symptomatology with reference to
the diagnostic bearings of the absence of free hydrochloric acid from
the stomach, of the presence of cancerous fragments in fluids from the
stomach, and of secondary cancers in different parts of the body.One must not lose sight of the fact that the whole complex of symptoms,
the order of their occurrence, and the general aspect of the case, make
an impression which cannot be conveyed in any diagnostic table, but
which leads the experienced physician to a correct diagnosis more
surely than reliance upon any single symptom.In the early part of the disease there may be danger of confounding
gastric cancer with nervous dyspepsia or with gastralgia, but with the
progress of the disease the error usually becomes apparent.What has
already been said concerning the symptomatology and the diagnosis of
gastric cancer furnishes a sufficient basis for the differential
diagnosis between this disease and nervous affections of the stomach.Chronic interstitial gastritis or fibroid induration of the stomach
cannot be distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.Fibroid induration of the stomach is of longer duration than gastric
cancer, and it is less frequently attended by severe pain and
hemorrhage.Sometimes a hard, smooth tumor presenting the contours of
the stomach can be felt, but this cannot be distinguished from diffuse
cancerous infiltration of the stomach.Non-malignant stenosis of the pylorus is of longer duration than cancer
of the pylorus.The symptoms of dilatation of the stomach are common to
both diseases.Cicatricial stenosis is the most common form of
non-malignant pyloric stenosis.This is usually preceded by symptoms of
gastric ulcer which may date back for many years.Non-malignant
stenosis more frequently occurs under forty years of age than does
cancer.The diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant stenosis of
the pylorus is in some cases impossible.Although the surest ground for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is the
appearance of tumor, there are cases in which it is difficult to decide
whether the tumor really belongs to the stomach, and even should it be
{572} established that the tumor is of the stomach, there may still be
doubt whether or not it is cancerous.The diagnosis between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach, such as sarcoma, fibroma, myoma, etc., hardly comes into
consideration.The latter group of tumors rarely produces symptoms
unless the tumor is so situated as to obstruct one of the orifices of
the stomach.Even in this case a positive diagnosis of the nature of
the tumor is impossible.Of greater importance is the distinction between cancerous tumors of
the stomach and tumors produced by thickening of the tissues and by
adhesions around old ulcers of the stomach.Besides the non-progressive
character of the small and usually indistinct tumors occasionally
caused by ulcers or their cicatrices, the main points in diagnosis are
the age of the patient and the existence, often for years, of symptoms
of gastric ulcer antedating the discovery of the tumor.The long
duration of symptoms of chronic catarrhal gastritis and of dilatation
of the stomach is also the main ground for distinguishing from cancer a
tumor produced by hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus.Tumors of organs near the stomach are liable to be mistaken for cancer
of the stomach.The differential diagnosis between gastric cancer on
the one hand, and tumors of the left lobe of the liver and tumors of
the pancreas on the other hand, is often one of great difficulty.Tumors of the liver are generally depressed by inspiration, whereas
tumors of the stomach are much less frequently affected by the
respiratory movements.The percussion note over tumors of the liver is
flat, while a tympanitic quality is usually associated with the dulness
over tumors of the stomach.Light percussion will often bring out a
zone of tympanitic resonance between the hepatic flatness and the
dulness of gastric tumors.Gastric tumors are usually more movable than
hepatic tumors.By palpation the lower border of the liver can perhaps
be felt and separated from the tumor in case this belongs to the
stomach.Most of the points of distinction based upon these physical
signs fail in cases in which a gastric cancer becomes firmly adherent
to the liver.The basis for a diagnosis must then be sought in the
presence or the absence of marked disturbance of the gastric functions,
particularly of haematemesis, vomiting, and dilatation of the stomach.On the other hand, ascites and persistent jaundice would speak in favor
of hepatic cancer.There are cases in which the diagnosis between
hepatic cancer and gastric cancer cannot be made.This is especially
true of tumors of the left lobe of the liver, which grow down over the
stomach and compress it, and which are accompanied by marked
derangement of the gastric functions.The frequency with which cancer
of the stomach is associated with secondary cancer of the liver should
be borne in mind in considering the diagnosis.There are certain symptoms which in many cases justify a probable
diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, but this disease can rarely be
distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.The
situation of the tumor is the same in both diseases.With pancreatic
cancer the pain is less influenced by taking food, the vomiting is less
prominent as a symptom, and anorexia, haematemesis, and dilatation of
the stomach are less common than with gastric cancer.Of the positive
symptoms in {573} favor of cancer of the pancreas, the most important
are jaundice, fatty stools, and sugar in the urine.Of these symptoms
jaundice is the most common.Should there be any suspicion that the tumor is caused by impaction of
feces, a positive opinion should be withheld until laxatives have been
given.Mistakes may occur as to the diagnosis between gastric cancer and
tumors of the omenta, the mesentery, the transverse colon, the
lymphatic glands, and even the spleen or the kidney.Encapsulated
peritoneal exudations near the stomach have been mistaken for gastric
cancer.Where a mistake is likely to occur each individual case
presents its own peculiarities, which it is impossible to deal with in
a general way.Of the utmost importance is a careful physical
exploration of the characters and relations of the tumor, aided, if
necessary, by artificial distension of the stomach or of the colon by
gas (see page 549).No less important is the attentive observance of
the symptoms of each case.In doubtful cases fluids withdrawn from the
stomach by the stomach-tube should be carefully examined for cancerous
fragments, and the gastric fluids may be tested for free hydrochloric
acid by methods already described.Pyloric cancers which receive a marked pulsation from the aorta
sometimes raise a suspicion of aneurism, but the differential diagnosis
is not usually one of great difficulty.Gastric cancer when it presses
upon the aorta may simulate aneurism, not only by the presence of
pulsation, but also by the existence of a bruit over the tumor.The
tumor produced by aneurism is generally smoother and rounder than that
caused by cancer.The pulsation of an aneurism is expansile, but the
impulse of a tumor resting upon an artery is lifting and generally
without lateral expansion.The impulse transmitted to a tumor resting
upon the abdominal aorta may be lessened by placing the patient upon
his hands and knees.Sometimes the tumor can be moved with the hands
off from the artery, so that the pulsation momentarily ceases.A severe
boring pain in the back, shooting down into the loins and the lower
extremities, and not dependent upon the condition of the stomach,
characterizes abdominal aneurism, but is not to be expected in gastric
cancer.With aneurism gastric disorders and constitutional disturbance
are much less prominent than with cancer of the stomach.[94]

[Footnote 94: In a case of pulsating pyloric cancer observed by Bierner
the symptoms were much more in favor of aneurism than of cancer.The
cancer had extended to the retro-peritoneal glands, which partially
surrounded and compressed the aorta.There were marked lateral
pulsation of the tumor, distinct systolic bruit, diminution of the
femoral pulse, and severe lancinating pain in the back and sacral
region.With the exception of vomiting, the gastric symptoms were
insignificant.The patient was only thirty-three years old (Ott, _Zur
Path.des Magencarcinoms_, Zurich, 1867, p.Spasm of the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle may simulate a
tumor in the epigastric region.The diagnosis is made by noting the
correspondence in shape and position between the tumor and a division
of the rectus muscle, the superficial character of the tumor, the
effect of different positions of the body upon the distinctness of the
tumor, the tympanitic resonance over the tumor, and, should there still
be any doubt, by anaesthetizing the patient, when the phantom tumor
will disappear.Spasm of the rectus muscle has been observed in cases
of cancer of the stomach.{574} Attention is also called to the possibility of mistaking in
emaciated persons the head of the normal pancreas, or less frequently
the mesentery and lymphatic glands, for a tumor.[95] As emaciation
progresses the at first doubtful tumor may even appear to increase in
size and distinctness.[Footnote 95: In the case of the late Comte de Chambord the diagnosis
of gastric cancer was made upon what appeared to be very good grounds.No cancer, however, existed, and the ill-defined tumor which was felt
during life in the epigastric region proved to be the mesentery
containing considerable fat (Vulpian, "La derniere Maladie de M. le
Comte de Chambord."It is sufficient to call attention to the danger of mistaking, in cases
where the gastric symptoms are not prominent and no tumor exists,
gastric cancer for pernicious anaemia, senile marasmus, or the chronic
phthisis of old age.In some of these cases the diagnosis is
impossible, but the physician should bear in mind the possibility of
gastric cancer in the class of cases here considered, and should search
carefully for a tumor or other symptom which may aid in the diagnosis.The possibility of mistaking gastric cancer accompanied with peritoneal
exudation for cirrhosis of the liver or for tubercular peritonitis is
also to be borne in mind.The diagnosis of the position of the cancer in the stomach can usually
be made in cases of cancer of the cardia or of the pylorus.The
symptoms diagnostic of cancer of the cardia are dysphagia,
regurgitation of food, obstruction in the passage of the oesophageal
bougie, and sinking in of the epigastric region in consequence of
atrophy of the stomach.It has already been said that catheterization
of the oesophagus does not always afford the evidence of obstruction
which one would expect.Cancerous stenosis of the cardia is to be
distinguished from cicatricial stenosis in this situation.The
diagnosis is based upon the history of the case, which is generally
decisive, and upon finding fragments of cancer in the tube passed down
the oesophagus.That the cancer is seated at the pylorus is made evident by the
situation of the tumor (see p.561) and by the existence of dilatation
of the stomach.There are many more causes of stenosis of the pylorus
than of stenosis of the cardia, so that, notwithstanding the absence of
tumor, cancer of the cardia is often more readily diagnosticated than
cancer of the pylorus.The greatest difficulty in diagnosis is presented by cancers which do
not obstruct the orifices of the stomach.Many of these cancers run an
almost latent course so far as the gastric symptoms are concerned, and
in case they produce no recognizable tumor and are unattended with
hemorrhage, the difficulties in their diagnosis are almost
insurmountable.In general, a diagnosis of the particular form of cancer which is
present cannot be made, nor is such a diagnosis of any practical value.In very exceptional cases such a diagnosis might be made by the
examination of secondary subcutaneous cancers[96] or of fragments found
in the fluids obtained from the stomach.[Footnote 96: As for example, in Finlay's case, already referred to (p.It is not safe to trust implicitly in this criterion, as the
subcutaneous tumors may be of a different nature from the tumor of the
stomach, as in an interesting case observed by Leube (_op.Although the diagnosis of gastric cancer can generally be made before
the death of the patient, unfortunately a positive diagnosis in the
early stages of the disease is usually impossible.Should resection of
cancer {575} of the stomach become a legitimate operation in surgery,
it will be of the utmost importance to make the diagnosis in an early
stage of the disease.Only those cases are suitable for resection in
which there are no secondary deposits, the general health of the
patient is in fair condition, and extensive adhesions have not been
formed.It was to be hoped that the ingenious instrument devised by
Mikulicz for exploring the interior of the stomach by electrical
illumination would prove a valuable aid in diagnosis.The gastroscope
in its present construction, however, has proved of little value.[97]
It is, moreover, difficult to manipulate, and is not free from danger
to the patient.We may be permitted, however, to hope for improvement
in this direction.[Footnote 97: Mikulicz has observed with the gastroscope in a case of
pyloric cancer immobility of the pylorus and absence of rugae in the
mucous membrane of the pyloric region (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1883,
No.It does not seem probable that there can be anything peculiar
to cancer in these appearances.]In cases in which there is reasonable suspicion of the existence of
gastric cancer, and in which there is proper ground to contemplate
resection of the tumor, it is justifiable to make an exploratory
incision into the abdomen.It can then be decided whether or not cancer
exists, and whether the case is suitable for operation.When this
incision is made with all of the precautions known to modern surgery,
it is attended with little or no danger,[98] and it should not be made
except by surgeons who are practically familiar with these precautions.[Footnote 98: Of 20 exploratory incisions for tumor of the stomach
performed by Billroth, not one had ended fatally (_Deutsche med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, ii.).]PROGNOSIS.--There is no proof that cancer of the stomach has ever ended
in recovery.It may be admitted that partial cicatrization of gastric
cancer may occur.We have, however, no sufficient reason to believe
that cancer of the stomach has ever been completely destroyed by any
process of nature or by any medicinal treatment.A successful resection of a cancer of the pylorus by Billroth in
January, 1881, made a great sensation in the medical world.Since that
time the operation has been performed successfully ten times, and with
fatal issue twenty-seven times.A radical cure has not, however, been
effected, although life has been prolonged for a year and a half after
the operation.[99] The possibility of permanent cure of gastric cancer
by extirpation must be admitted.Enthusiasm over this possibility,
however, is seriously lessened by the fact that a radical cure is not
to be expected unless the operation is undertaken when the tumor is of
small size, has produced no distant metastases, is free from many
adhesions, and the patient is not greatly prostrated.In view of the
difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages it is not likely that these
favorable conditions can be fulfilled except in the rarest instances.Metastases may already exist when the tumor is small and before it has
given rise to any symptoms.[100] Pylorectomy, moreover, will probably
be successful in the hands of only comparatively few surgeons.It is
therefore but a feeble glimmer of hope {576} which is now admitted to
the hitherto relentlessly fatal forecast of this disease.[Footnote 99: Several of the patients are still living (1884), but, so
far as I can learn, no patient has survived the operation more than a
year and a half.][Footnote 100: Birch-Hirschfeld relates a case in which a non-ulcerated
cancerous tumor not larger than a silver half-dollar was found in the
pyloric region of the stomach of a woman who died from injury.The
tumor had given rise to no symptoms.Nevertheless, numerous metastases
existed in the lymphatic glands of the omentum and of the lesser
curvature (_Jahresb.d. gesellschaft f. Natur u. Heilk.im Dresden_
[1882-83], 1883, p.TREATMENT.--Even up to the present time various drugs have been vaunted
as effecting a radical cure of cancer of the stomach.Some of these,
such as mercury, are positively harmful; others, such as conium,
belladonna, and condurango, are often palliative; but not one has been
proven to be curative.Since its recommendation by Friedreich in 1874,
condurango has enjoyed the greatest vogue.The few observations in
which, under the use of this agent, tumors, real or apparent, of the
stomach have lessened in size or disappeared, admit of other
interpretations than as cures of gastric cancer.There is, however,
considerable testimony as to the virtues of condurango as a stomachic.In some cases it relieves the pain, vomiting, and indigestion of
gastric cancer, but in many cases it is employed without benefit.The
drug which passes by the name of condurango in the market is a very
variable preparation.According to Friedreich's directions, decoction
of condurango is prepared as follows: Macerate oz.condurango for twelve hours with fluidounce xij of water; then boil
down to fluidounce vj and strain.The dose is a tablespoonful two or
three times daily.The decoction of condurango may be combined with
syr.While all specific treatment of gastric cancer is to be abandoned, much
can be done for the relief and comfort of the patient.In general, the indications are similar to those in gastric ulcer.It
is not necessary, however, to restrict the diet to the same extent as
in gastric ulcer.The patient's tastes may be consulted to a
considerable extent.Still, it will be found, as a rule, that the
patient is most comfortable when his diet is confined to
easily-digestible substances, such as milk, beef-juice, Leube's
beef-solution, rare beefsteak, and other articles mentioned under the
treatment of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric cancer will usually require the administration of
opium in some form.There is manifestly not the same objection to the
employment of narcotics in a necessarily fatal disease like cancer as
in ulcer of the stomach.Opium may be given in pill form or as the
tincture or deodorized tincture, or often most advantageously as
hypodermic injections of morphia, to which atropia may be added.Vomiting is sometimes controlled by regulation of the diet,
particularly by iced milk.For this symptom also opium or morphia is
often necessary.In addition, the customary remedies for relief of
vomiting, such as bits of ice, iced champagne, soda-water, hydrocyanic
acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, may be tried.Cold or hot
applications to the abdomen and mild counter-irritants, such as mustard
plaster or turpentine stupes, sometimes afford relief.If the vomiting
be incoercible, it may be well to administer food for a short time
exclusively by the rectum, and in case of stenosing cancer of the
cardia this method of administering food may be the only one possible.Acid eructations and heartburn are often relieved by the antacids, as
bicarbonate of sodium, lime-water, or calcined magnesia.Against
fermentative processes in the stomach have been recommended salicylate
of sodium, creasote, carbolic acid, and the alkaline hyposulphites.Charcoal tablets are as useful as, and less likely to disagree than,
other antifermentatives.{577} In view of V. d. Velden's
investigations, already mentioned, the administration of dilute
hydrochloric acid in an hour after a meal is indicated.Excellent results have been obtained by regularly washing out the
stomach in cases of gastric cancer, particularly in pyloric cancer with
dilatation of the stomach.By this procedure pain, indigestion, and
vomiting are often greatly relieved, and the patient experiences a
renewed sense of well-being.Unfortunately, the benefit is only
temporary.The syphon process is most conveniently employed.Contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube are copious
gastrorrhagia and great weakness of the patient.When constipation is not relieved by washing out the stomach, enemata
should be employed.Drastic purgatives should not be given.For diarrhoea opium may be given, particularly in the form of small
enemata of starch and laudanum.Scanty hemorrhage in the form of coffee-grounds vomiting requires no
treatment.Copious haematemesis is to be treated according to the
principles laid down under the treatment of hemorrhage from gastric
ulcer.Discussion of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer of course does
not belong to this work.The opinion entertained by the physician as to
the propriety of surgical interference in gastric cancer is not,
however, a matter of indifference, for cases of gastric cancer come
first into the hands of the physician, and generally only by his
recommendation into those of the surgeon.So long as the physician
stands absolutely powerless before this disease, his general attitude
as to the propriety of surgical interference should not be one of
hostility.Experience only can determine the justification of surgical
operation in cases of gastric cancer.As yet, it is too soon to express
a positive opinion as to the value of resection of gastric cancer.Of
37 published resections of cancer of the pylorus, 27 died from the
effects of the operation, and of the fatal cases 18 within the first
twenty-four hours.These results are certainly not calculated to awaken
much enthusiasm for the operation.Still, it would be wrong to draw
definite conclusions from the existing statistics of resection of the
cancerous pylorus, partly because the number of operations is as yet
too small, partly because the operation has been done when it was
certainly unwarrantable according to the best judges (Billroth,
Czerny), and chiefly because the number of operators in proportion to
the number of operations is too great.For the 37 published operations
there have been 27 operators.Ovariotomy was not considered a
justifiable operation until the excellent results of individual
operators were obtained.It is probable that to an even greater extent
resection of the pylorus will become the specialty of certain
operators.Therefore, before concluding as to the value of resection of
cancer of the stomach it is necessary to await the results of
individual surgeons in a series of cases.[101]

[Footnote 101: Already, from this point of view, the operation appears
more hopeful.Czerny has performed 6 resections of the stomach with
only 2 fatal results; 4 of the operations were pylorectomies for
cancer.Billroth has performed the operation 8 times with 3 fatal
results (_Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1884, Nos.So much, however, is now certain, that with our present means of
diagnosis the number of cases suitable for extirpation is very
small.[102] A {578} radical cure is to be expected only in the rarest
instances, so that the value of the operation will depend chiefly upon
the condition of the patient after its performance.As regards this
point, the results in the successful cases have been encouraging.In
several instances the terrible sufferings of the patient have given
place to months of comparative health and comfort.[Footnote 102: Billroth at the eleventh session of the Congress of
German Surgeons said that he was amazed at the number of resections of
the pylorus which had been performed.Out of 50 to 60 cases of gastric
cancer, only 1 appeared to him suitable for operation.]In cases of extreme cancerous stenosis of the pylorus which are not
suitable for resection Wolfler proposed forming a fistulous
communication between the stomach and the small intestine
(gastro-enterostomy).The results of the operation have not been
encouraging.Out of six cases in which this operation has been
performed, only two patients lived after the operation.For the same condition Schede proposed making a duodenal fistula
(duodenostomy), but I am not aware that the operation has been
performed.The results of gastrostomy for relief of cancerous stenosis of the
cardia or of the oesophagus have not been encouraging.[103]

[Footnote 103: Of 76 cases of gastrostomy for the relief of cancer of
the oesophagus or of the cardia, only 14 lived over thirty days
(Leisrink and Alsberg, _Arch.Non-Cancerous Tumors of the Stomach.Little clinical interest attaches to non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach.They are comparatively rare and usually unattended by
symptoms.Even should a tumor be discovered, there are no means of
determining the nature of the tumor; and if symptoms are produced by
the tumor, the case will probably be diagnosticated as one of cancer.It is necessary, therefore, in the present work to do little more than
enumerate the different forms of non-cancerous tumor of the stomach.The most common of benign gastric tumors are polypi projecting into the
interior of the stomach.These are usually so-called mucous or
adenomatous polypi, being composed of hypertrophied or hyperplastic
elements of the mucous membrane with or without new growth of submucous
tissue.They may be present in large number (one hundred and fifty to
two hundred in a case of Leudet's).Their development is usually
attributed to a chronic catarrhal gastritis, so that a gastritis
polypora has been distinguished.These polyps are important only when
they obstruct one of the orifices of the stomach, in which case they
may cause even fatal stenosis.Benign adenomata appear less frequently as growths in the submucous
coat of the stomach (Winiwarter).Myomata and myosarcomata, projecting sometimes as polyps either into
the gastric or the peritoneal cavity, may attain a very large size, as
in a case reported by Brodowski in which a cystic myosarcoma of the
stomach weighed twelve pounds.[104]

[Footnote 104: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Sarcoma, either as a primary or a secondary tumor of the stomach, is
rare.Two cases of secondary lympho-sarcoma of the stomach (primary of
the retro-peritoneal glands) without gastric symptoms have come under
my observation.In a similar case reported by Coupland the symptoms
resembled those of gastric cancer.[105]

[Footnote 105: _Trans.{579} In connection with gastric ulcer mention has already been made of
the occurrence of miliary aneurisms in the stomach, which may be the
cause of fatal haematemesis.Sometimes the mucous membrane is studded with little cysts, as in a
case reported by Harris.[106]

[Footnote 106: _Am.Fibromata and lipomata are very rare.Foreign bodies in the stomach, particularly balls of hair, have been
sometimes mistaken for tumors, particularly cancer, of this organ.Schonborn removed successfully a ball of hair from the stomach by
gastrotomy.[107] Before the operation the tumor was considered to be a
movable kidney.{580}

HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.Hemorrhage from the stomach is a symptom, and not a disease.It is a
result of a great variety of morbid conditions in the description of
which it receives more or less consideration.Already the
symptomatology and treatment of hemorrhage from the stomach have been
considered in connection with its two most important causes--namely,
gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.It remains to give a summary of the
etiology and diagnosis of gastric hemorrhage.Hemorrhage from the stomach is also called gastrorrhagia.The term
haematemesis is not synonymous with gastric hemorrhage, for blood may
be vomited which has simply been swallowed or has passed from the
intestine into the stomach.ETIOLOGY.--The causes of gastric hemorrhage are as follows:

1.Ulcer of the Stomach.--Simple gastric ulcer is the most frequent
cause of abundant hemorrhage from the stomach.Tuberculous gastric
ulcers, typhoid gastric ulcers, and the ulcers of phlegmonous gastritis
are extremely rare causes of hemorrhage.Hemorrhagic erosion of the
stomach, which by many writers is assigned an important place in the
etiology of gastric hemorrhage, is not an independent affection, and in
my opinion is without any clinical significance.Cancer of the Stomach.--(Non-cancerous tumors of the stomach hardly
deserve mention in this connection, so infrequently are they the cause
of gastric hemorrhage.)Traumatism (mechanical, chemical, thermic).--_a_.Acting from
without the stomach: severe injury to the abdomen, as by a blow or a
fall; penetrating wounds of the stomach.Acting from within the stomach: foreign bodies, particularly
sharp-pointed ones; corrosive poisons, as acids and alkalies; other
toxic inflammatory irritants; and very hot substances.Here should also
be mentioned injury from an inflexible stomach-tube and aspiration of
mucous membrane with the stomach-pump.Diseases of the Gastric Blood-vessels.--_a_.Aneurism of the
arteries of the stomach.Miliary aneurisms have been found by Galliard
and others as a cause of profuse and even fatal hemorrhage from the
stomach.Especially in obscure cases should careful search be made for
miliary aneurisms.Varices of the veins are a not unimportant cause of gastric
hemorrhage.They are most frequently associated with chronic passive
{581} congestion of the stomach, but they may be found without any
apparent disturbance of the circulation.Degenerations of the vessels, particularly fatty and atheromatous
degeneration of the arteries.Probably gastric hemorrhage in
phosphorus-poisoning is to be attributed to fatty degeneration of the
arteries.Amyloid degeneration of the blood-vessels is a doubtful cause
of hemorrhage.Active Congestion of the Stomach.--Here is usually placed gastric
hemorrhage as a result of severe inflammation of the stomach (as acute
catarrhal gastritis), although in these cases the inflammatory
alteration of the vascular walls is an equally important factor.With more probability the so-called vicarious hemorrhages from the
stomach are to be assigned to active congestion.Sceptical as one is
inclined to be as regards vicarious hemorrhages of the menses, the
occurrence of such hemorrhages, although rare, must be admitted.Doubtful, however, are alleged cases of gastric hemorrhage taking the
place of suppressed hemorrhoidal bleeding or of epistaxis.Passive Congestion of the Stomach.--This embraces an important group
of causes of gastric hemorrhage.This hemorrhage is the result of
venous congestion caused by some obstruction to the portal circulation.The obstruction may be--

_a_.In the portal vein itself or its branches within the liver, as in
pylethrombosis, cirrhosis of the liver, tumors, such as cancer or
echinococcus cysts, compressing the portal vein, occlusion of
capillaries in the liver by pigment-deposits in melanaemia, and
dilatation of the bile-ducts in the liver from obstruction to the flow
of bile.Next to ulcer and to cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the
liver is the most frequent and important cause of gastrorrhagia.In the pulmonary blood-vessels, as in pulmonary emphysema, chronic
pleurisy, and fibroid induration of the lungs.In the heart in consequence of uncompensated valvular and other
diseases of the heart.For evident reasons, obstruction of the pulmonary or of the cardiac
circulation is much less likely to cause gastric hemorrhage than is
obstruction in the portal vein or the liver.Possibly, gastric hemorrhage which is caused by violent acts of
vomiting may be caused by venous congestion of the mucous membrane of
the stomach.In support of this view, Rindfleisch advances the idea
that the veins in the muscular layers of the stomach, in consequence of
the thinness of their coats, are much more likely than the arteries to
suffer from the compression of the muscle during its contraction.The occasional occurrence of gastric hemorrhage during pregnancy has
also been attributed to passive congestion of the stomach.Acute Infectious Diseases--namely, yellow fever, acute yellow
atrophy of the liver, relapsing fever; less frequently cholera, typhoid
fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and the exanthematous
fevers, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.The cause of gastric hemorrhage in these diseases is not understood.The usual explanation attributes the hemorrhage to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles and secondary alteration of the walls of the
blood-vessels.Plugging of the vessels with micro-organisms has been
found {582} in only a few instances.The gastrorrhagia of acute yellow
atrophy of the liver has been attributed to dissolution of the blood,
not only by some infectious agent, but also by constituents of the
bile, and also to obstruction of the portal circulation by destruction
and occlusion of capillaries in the liver.Hemorrhagic
diatheses--namely, scorbutus, purpura, and haematophilia.Strictly
speaking, a hemorrhagic diathesis exists in other affections of this
class.Here we may distinguish, first, periodical malarial
hemorrhages from the stomach which are cured by quinia; second,
pernicious gastric malarial fever, of very grave prognosis; and third,
hemorrhages in malarial cachexia due to extreme anaemia.Cases which
have been described as malaria with scorbutic complications belong
mostly to the last variety.Mention has already been made of gastric
hemorrhages attributed to malarial pigmentation of the liver.The most important affections in this category
are progressive pernicious anaemia, leucocythaemia, and
pseudo-leucocythaemia, including the so-called splenic anaemia.The hemorrhage is attributed to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles by the action of the biliary salts.Gastric hemorrhage is a rare event in Bright's disease, occurring more
especially with small kidneys.In one such case I found that the fatal
hemorrhage was due to the bursting of a miliary aneurism of a small
artery in the submucous coat.Probably in all similar cases the
hemorrhage is referable to disease of the vascular walls.Neuropathic Conditions.--Although ecchymoses in the mucous membrane
of the stomach can be experimentally produced by injury of various
parts of the brain and spinal cord, there is no proof that gastric
hemorrhage which is of any clinical importance is referable to
structural diseases of the nervous system.The occasional occurrence of
gastric hemorrhage in progressive paralysis of the insane, in
tuberculous meningitis, in epilepsy, is to be attributed to other
causes.In lack of a better explanation, however, the gastric hemorrhages which
have been occasionally observed in hysterical women may be classified
here.These constitute not the least important class of gastric
hemorrhages.The hemorrhages from the stomach in chlorosis belong
partly here and partly to anaemia.Melaena Neonatorum.--Although in some cases ulcers have been found
in the stomach or duodenum, and in others a general hemorrhagic
diathesis exists, it must be said that the etiology of this grave
disease is still very obscure.Bursting of Aneurisms or of Abscesses from without into the
Stomach.Idiopathic Causes.--Under this unsatisfactory designation are
included cases which are aptly described by Flint[1] in the following
words: "Hemorrhage sometimes occurs from the stomach, as from the
bronchial tubes, the Schneiderian membrane, and in other situations,
without any apparent pathological connections, neither following nor
preceding any appreciable morbid conditions.It is then to be
considered {583} as idiopathic."A person in apparent health has
suddenly a hemorrhage, often profuse, from the stomach, which is
followed only by symptoms immediately referable to the hemorrhage.The
hemorrhage is naturally the source of great anxiety.Ulcer or cancer of
the stomach or some other grave disease is usually suspected.But the
patient develops no further symptoms, and often never has another
hemorrhage.Whatever hypotheses one may construct for these cases of
so-called idiopathic hemorrhage, the recognition of the clinical fact
of their occurrence is important.[Footnote 1: Austin Flint, _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine_, 5th ed., p.Inasmuch as hemorrhage from the stomach is usually made manifest by the
vomiting of blood, it is important to bear in mind that gastric
hemorrhage is not the only cause of haematemesis.Blood may gain access
to the stomach by being swallowed in cases of hemorrhages from the
nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, lungs, and oesophagus.Blood may also
enter the stomach from the duodenum in cases of simple ulcer of the
duodenum or of typhoid ulcers situated in the upper part of the
intestine.The SYMPTOMS of hemorrhage from the stomach have already been described
in connection with ULCER OF THE STOMACH.MORBID ANATOMY.--As is evident from the enumeration of the causes of
gastric hemorrhage, the lesions found after death are manifold.A
description of these lesions, however, does not belong here.It is
necessary, however, to say a few words concerning the demonstration of
the source of the hemorrhage.The hemorrhage is arterial, venous, or capillary in origin.Ulcerations
from the stomach into the heart, which have been mentioned in
connection with gastric ulcer, are too infrequent to come into
consideration in this connection.If the bleeding is from a large
artery or vein or from a medium-sized aneurism or varix, the
demonstration of its source is not difficult.Often, however, in cases
of fatal gastric hemorrhage the search for the source of the hemorrhage
has proved fruitless.It is supposed that in many such cases the
hemorrhage is due to diapedesis, and not to rupture of a blood-vessel
(rhexis).Doubtless, small gastric hemorrhages, particularly those into
the tissues of the stomach, are often the result of diapedesis, but in
cases of profuse hemorrhages from the stomach where the source of the
hemorrhage is not demonstrable after death, the convenient assumption
of hemorrhage by diapedesis, in my opinion, plays too important a role.In most cases of profuse gastrorrhagia the symptoms point to a sudden
outpouring of blood into the stomach; and our knowledge of diapedesis
does not warrant the belief that the red blood-corpuscles can escape
through the unsuffused walls of the vessels with that combined rapidity
and abundance which would be necessary to explain the sudden and
profuse hemorrhage.In these cases hemorrhage by rhexis is altogether
more probable even when ruptured vessels cannot be demonstrated.It
often requires a long-continued and careful search to find a small
vessel which is ruptured.In the case above mentioned of fatal
haematemesis from miliary aneurism over an hour of continuous searching
was required to find the pinhole perforation in the mucous membrane in
the bottom of which lay the small aneurism.Chiari[2] has reported a
fatal gastric hemorrhage due to rupture of a submucous vein.The
erosion of the mucous membrane was not larger than a hempseed.The
examination of the mucous membrane is often much impeded by the {584}
closely-adherent mucus and blood, which have to be carefully removed.Injection of the vessels of the stomach with fluid may aid in finding a
ruptured vessel.It is not intended to assert that in all cases of
fatal gastric hemorrhage a painstaking search would reveal the source
of the hemorrhage, but it is believed that cases of fatal gastric
hemorrhage would less frequently be reported with negative anatomical
result as hemorrhages by diapedesis, or by exhalation, or as
parenchymatous or capillary hemorrhages, if such a search were made.Wochenschr._, 1882, No.DIAGNOSIS.--Undoubtedly, small hemorrhages into the stomach often occur
which are not recognized, and in the absence of vomiting even larger
hemorrhages may escape detection unless a careful examination of the
stools be made.The patient may die from abundant gastric hemorrhage
before any blood has been vomited or has passed by the bowels.When there is doubt whether the black color of the stools is due to
blood or to the administration of iron or of bismuth, it generally
suffices to add water to the stools.If blood be present, the water
will acquire a reddish color.Should doubt still remain, then the
microscope, the spectroscope, or the test for haemin crystals may be
called into requisition (see p.Whether black, tarry stools are produced by hemorrhage from the stomach
or by hemorrhage in the upper part of the intestine can be decided only
by the clinical history.If haematemesis be likewise present, the
presumption is strongly in favor of gastric hemorrhage.The diagnosis,
however, between hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer and that from gastric
ulcer is very difficult, and can rarely be positively made.The mere inspection of the vomit is generally sufficient to determine
whether it contain blood or not.Color more or less resembling that of
altered blood may be produced in the vomit by iron, bismuth, red wine,
various fruits, such as cranberries, and by bile.When a careful
inspection by the physician leaves doubt as to the presence of
blood--which will rarely be the case--then here also recourse may be
had to the microscope, spectroscope, and test for haemin crystals.Sometimes blood is swallowed and then vomited by hysterical females or
by malingering soldiers or prisoners for purpose of deceit.In such
cases there are generally no evidences of acute anaemia or of gastric
disease.The blood of some animals can be distinguished by the
microscope from human blood.When suspicion of deceit exists, there are
generally various ways of entrapping the patient.When blood is vomited by nursing infants the possibility of its coming
from the breast of the mother is to be thought of.Sometimes blood from the nose or throat is swallowed, particularly when
the bleeding occurs during the night.This blood may subsequently be
vomited.The inspection of the nose or throat will generally reveal the
source of the hemorrhage in such cases.The diagnosis between hemorrhage from the oesophagus and that from the
stomach must be based upon the clinical history.The oesophagoscope,
however, has been successfully employed for diagnostic purposes.Several cases have been reported of fatal hemorrhage from varices of
the oesophagus.Such hemorrhage cannot be distinguished from gastric
hemorrhage.Much more frequently arises the question whether the hemorrhage is from
the stomach or from the lungs.Sometimes the decision of this point
{585} is very difficult, and it may even be impossible, especially when
the physician is obliged to trust only to the statements of the patient
or his friends.Difficulty in the diagnosis results mainly from the
fact that coughing and vomiting of blood are often associated with each
other.With haemoptysis blood may be swallowed and then vomited, and
with haematemesis more or less coughing occurs.The diagnosis is to be
based upon the points contained in the following table:

As it is important that the patient should be as quiet as possible
during and for some time after the hemorrhage, any physical examination
which disturbs the patient, such as percussing the posterior part of
the chest or palpating the abdomen, should be avoided.The diagnosis of the many causes of gastric hemorrhage belongs to the
description of the various diseases which have been enumerated under
the etiology.PROGNOSIS.--It is exceptional for gastric hemorrhage to prove
immediately fatal.According to Fox, such an occurrence is more
frequent with cirrhosis of the liver than with ulcer or cancer of the
stomach.The ultimate result of the hemorrhage depends greatly upon the
previous condition of the patient.If this condition was good, he often
rallies from the most desperate prostration immediately following the
hemorrhage.A previously enfeebled patient is of course more likely to
yield to the further anaemia and exhaustion caused by profuse
hemorrhage.Although the symptoms of gastric ulcer and of cirrhosis of
the liver are sometimes improved after hemorrhage from the stomach,
nevertheless this hemorrhage can never be regarded as a welcome event.For the treatment of gastric hemorrhage see ULCER OF THE STOMACH.{586}

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--By dilatation of the stomach is understood a condition in
which the stomach is abnormally large and is unequal to the performance
of its normal functions.It will be observed that this definition of
dilatation of the stomach includes an anatomical disturbance and a
physiological disturbance.A stomach which, although unusually large,
performs its functions perfectly well is not, in the clinical sense, a
dilated stomach.The most characteristic functional disturbance in
dilatation of the stomach is delay in the propulsion of the gastric
contents into the intestine in consequence of inability of the muscular
coat of the stomach to perform the work imposed upon it.This muscular
insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, necessarily involves
disorder of the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach.SYNONYMS.--Dilatatio ventriculi; Gastrectasia.It has been proposed to
call the early stages of the disease insufficiency of the stomach
(Rosenbach).The condition described by Chomel as dyspepsia of liquids
is undoubtedly dilatation of the stomach.HISTORY.--Dilatation as a disease of the stomach is not mentioned by
writers of antiquity.Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1623 was among the
first to record an observation of dilatation of the stomach.During the
following century cases of dilatation of the stomach were recorded more
as curiosities than as of clinical interest.Most cases were attributed
to eating or drinking inordinate quantities.In 1743, Widman clearly
recognized stenosis of the pylorus as a cause of gastric dilatation.In
the works of Van Swieten, Morgagni, Lieutaud, and J. P. Frank, during
the latter half of the last century, different causes of dilatation of
the stomach are recognized.The last writer especially distinguishes
clearly between dilatation due to stenosis and that due to atony.The
data as to the symptoms of the disease were still very imperfect.In
1833, Duplay[1] published an important article in which the main points
in the causation and symptomatology of dilatation of the stomach are
clearly described.After this time the important works on the practice
of medicine or on diseases of the stomach contain, in the main, correct
descriptions of the disease under consideration.Since the publication
in 1869 of Kussmaul's memorable article[2] on the treatment of
dilatation of the stomach by the {587} stomach-pump, much greater
attention has been paid to this disease than ever before, so that the
literature upon this subject during the last fifteen years is very
considerable.In 1875, Penzoldt published an excellent monograph upon
dilatation of the stomach.[3]

[Footnote 1: _Arch.[Footnote 2: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul
first employed the stomach-pump in dilatation of the stomach in 1867,
and in that year he reported a successful result (_Schmidt's Jahrb._,
Bd.[Footnote 3: _Die Magenerweiterung_, Erlangen, 1875.To this work I am
indebted for most of the historical data in the text.]ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the stomach is the result of inability of this
organ to propel its contents into the intestine within the normal space
of time.In the performance of this mechanical work three factors are
involved--namely, the muscular force of the stomach, the quantity and
quality of the gastric contents, and the size of the opening between
the stomach and the intestine.All causes of dilatation of the stomach
may be referred to abnormalities of one or more of these factors.The most important group of causes is represented by stenosis of the
pyloric orifice or of the adjacent part of the stomach or of the
intestine.[4] Most cases of hypertrophic dilatation of the
stomach--that is, dilatation with hypertrophy of the muscular walls of
the stomach--are produced by causes belonging to this group.[Footnote 4: Dilatation of the stomach in consequence of intestinal
obstruction below the duodenum is so rare that no further attention is
given to the subject in the present article.The term pyloric stenosis
is often used in the course of the article to include any obstruction
to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the intestine,
whether the obstruction be in the duodenum, the pyloric orifice, or the
pyloric region.]The most frequent cause of pyloric stenosis is carcinoma, either in the
form of a diffuse infiltration of the gastric walls in this region or
as a tumor projecting into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the
stomach.Next in frequency are cicatricial growths resulting from
simple ulcer involving the pyloric region.Much less frequent are
similar cicatricial stenoses of the pylorus resulting from ulcers
produced by swallowing corrosive poisons.Simple hypertrophy of the
coats of the stomach in the pyloric region, particularly of the fibrous
and muscular coats, is an occasional cause of dilatation.Obstruction
of the pylorus by mucous polypi or by hypertrophic folds of mucous
membrane is so rare as to have little practical interest.Likewise,
stenosis caused by sarcomata, fibromata, myomata, lipomata, and cysts
need be mentioned only for the sake of completeness.Narrowing of the pyloric orifice may be caused also by pressure from
outside of the stomach, as by tumors, particularly cancer, of the liver
and of the pancreas, and by the contraction of fibrous adhesions and
thickenings resulting from perigastritis.Obstruction of the duodenum
by tumors growing in its walls, by cicatrices resulting from ulcers,
and by external pressure may also cause dilatation of the stomach.According to Barker, compression of the duodenum by a wandering right
kidney may induce dilatation of the stomach.The mere association of
dilatation of the stomach and movable right kidney, however, cannot be
considered proof that the former is caused by the latter, for the
subjects of movable kidney (most frequently women with flabby abdominal
walls who have borne many children) are often also favorable subjects
for atonic dilatation of the stomach.Sometimes with dilatation of the stomach the pyloric orifice is found
abnormally small, without any thickening or other appreciable change in
the walls of the pylorus.These cases in adults have been described by
{588} Landerer under the name of congenital stenosis of the pylorus,
but his conclusions are not free from doubt.[5] Congenital stenosis,
and even complete occlusion of the pylorus, has been observed in
infants.[6]

[Footnote 5: _Ueber angeborene Stenose des Pylorus_, Inaug.Diss.,
Tubingen, 1879.In the ten cases studied by Landerer the patients were
all adults, mostly in advanced life.In only one case is it mentioned
that indigestion existed from childhood; the clinical history in all is
incomplete.With the exception of one case there was no marked
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, such as is usually
found with benign pyloric stenosis and would naturally be expected with
a stenosis existing since birth.The pyloric orifice varied from 1-1/2
cm.Some of the specimens had been in alcohol for
a considerable time.In my opinion, Landerer has not brought forward
sufficient proof that in these cases stenosis of the pylorus existed
since birth.][Footnote 6: Wunsche, _Jahrb.d. Kinderheilk._, viii.Andral, Forster, and Bull have found congenital stenosis and atresia of
the pylorus.]Spasm of the pyloric muscle, which, according to Kussmaul, may be
referable to erosions, ulcers, and inflammations of the adjacent mucous
membrane, can be admitted only as a hypothetical explanation of some
cases of dilatation of the stomach.Somewhat problematical, although not improbable, is the production of
stenosis of the pylorus or of the duodenum by torsion and by
displacement of these parts.Dilatation of the stomach is sometimes
associated with scrotal hernia, particularly with that containing
omentum or transverse colon.This dilatation Kussmaul explains by the
production of a sharp bend between the movable first part and
comparatively fixed second part of the duodenum, in consequence of the
dragging downward of the stomach by the displaced omentum or transverse
colon.In a similar way Kussmaul believes that the weight of an
over-distended stomach may produce stenosis, and by this mechanism he
explains the occasional occurrence of symptoms of complete pyloric
obstruction when a large quantity of material has accumulated in an
already dilated stomach, and the prompt relief of these symptoms when
the burden of the stomach is removed either by vomiting or by the
stomach-tube.[7]

[Footnote 7: Another explanation given by Kussmaul, and likewise based
upon experiments on the cadaver, is that when the stomach is
over-distended it may rotate upon its own axis, so that the pylorus
acquires a sagittal direction and impinges against the first part of
the duodenum.This rotation of the stomach, however, can occur only
when the abdominal walls are flabby (Kussmaul, "Die Peristaltische
Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.The manner in which stenosis of the pylorus causes dilatation of the
stomach is sufficiently obvious to require no especial explanation.It
is, however, important to know that stenosis of the pylorus may be
compensated, so that even a very considerable degree of obstruction of
this orifice may exist without any dilatation of the stomach.The
obstruction may be completely counteracted by hypertrophy of the
muscular coat of the stomach, particularly of that in the right half of
the organ.Leube suggests that this increased muscular force, by
increasing the peristaltic movements, may also hasten the digestion and
absorption of the food, so far as these processes take place in the
stomach.[8] The timely removal of the contents of the stomach by
vomiting may also prevent over-distension of the organ.Another
compensatory circumstance may be the reduction of the quantity of solid
and liquid food taken by the patient.Conditions are often present,
however, which oppose the development of these {589} compensatory
circumstances.Such conditions are feebleness of the patient,
degeneration of the muscular coat of the stomach, chronic catarrhal
gastritis, insufficient secretion of gastric juice, and delayed
absorption, causing stagnation and fermentation of the food in the
stomach.[Footnote 8: Leube, in _V.Dilatation of the stomach may occur without any obstacle to the
evacuation of the gastric contents into the intestine.The cases of
so-called atonic dilatation of the stomach belong to this class.The
degree of dilatation in these cases is rarely so great as when the
dilatation is caused by stenosis.The cause of gastric dilatation in
the absence of stenosis is not always clear, so that a variety of
hypotheses, more or less probable, have been broached to explain these
obscure cases.Dilatation with unobstructed outlet of the stomach must be referable
either to abnormalities in the quantity or quality of the contents of
the stomach or to weakness of the muscular walls of the stomach.In
most cases both of these causes are combined, and it is not easy to
separate their action.Abnormal gastric contents may be the result of improper ingesta or of
disturbances in gastric digestion.Although in former times the
frequency of excessive eating and drinking as a cause of dilatation of
the stomach was doubtless exaggerated, nevertheless the efficacy of
this cause cannot be doubted.Dilatation of the stomach is said to be
common in people who live almost exclusively upon a vegetable diet and
therefore require large quantities of food.The habitual drinking of
large quantities of beer may cause dilatation of the stomach.The
occasional association of a dilated stomach with diabetes is referred
to the inordinate appetite and thirst which characterize this disease.If the food reaches the stomach imperfectly masticated, the process of
digestion is delayed, and as a result the stomach may become dilated.Indigestible food, particularly that which readily ferments in the
stomach, may be an indirect cause of the disease under consideration.A
similar role may be played by swallowing foreign substances either by
accident or by design.It is not proven that dilatation of the stomach
may be referable to exhaustion of its muscular power by the abuse of
agents which at first excite peristalsis, such as emetics, purgatives,
alcoholics, tobacco, spices, etc.Equally doubtful is the production of
dilatation by the misuse of narcotics, such as opium, which restrain
peristalsis.Of great importance in the production and continuance of gastrectasia
are all circumstances which cause stagnation and fermentation of the
contents of the stomach.These abnormalities of the gastric contents
are referable both to muscular and to chemical insufficiency of the
stomach, but in this connection it is desired to call attention
especially to chemical insufficiency, although in the production of
gastric dilatation this becomes always associated with muscular
insufficiency.In this way chronic catarrhal gastritis is operative in
the causation of gastric dilatation.In consequence of insufficient
secretion of normal gastric juice and of delayed absorption, the food
remains abnormally long undigested in the stomach, and fermentative
changes, with the development of gas, occur.No less important,
however, is the impairment of the muscular power of the stomach in
chronic gastritis.Stagnation and fermentation of the contents of the
stomach occur also in functional or atonic dyspepsia, which is to be
reckoned as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.{590} Naunyn[9]
emphasizes especially the importance of abnormal fermentations in the
stomach (alcoholic, butyric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid
fermentations) both as a cause and as a result of dilatation of the
stomach.Ulcer and cancer of the stomach may cause dilatation by
interfering with the normal digestive processes.[Footnote 9: _Deutsches Arch.We come now to the third and final group of causes of dilatation of the
stomach--namely, those included under weakness of the muscular walls of
the stomach.In the last analysis all causes of gastric dilatation come
under this heading, for even with pyloric stenosis and with excessive
contents a stomach will not dilate so long as its muscular power is
equal to the proper performance of the work which is demanded.In this
connection, however, reference is had especially to those cases in
which impairment or restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach
may be regarded more or less directly as the primary cause of
dilatation of the stomach.Clearest of comprehension are those cases in which the muscular power
of the stomach is impaired by organic changes in the muscular coat.Here may be mentioned partial destruction of the muscular coat,
particularly of that in the pyloric region, by ulcers and by cancers.Thus, ulcers and cancers which in no way obstruct the outlet of the
stomach may cause dilatation of the organ.Inflammatory infiltration
(inflammatory oedema) of the muscular coat has been adduced as a cause
of its weakness in chronic catarrhal gastritis and in peritonitis.Whether this is the proper explanation or not, there is no doubt that
the muscular coat of the stomach may become paretic in cases of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, as well as the subjacent muscle in inflammations
of other mucous membranes, as in laryngitis or in cystitis.Our
knowledge of the relation between degeneration of the muscular coat of
the stomach and gastrectasia is very imperfect.Fatty and colloid
degeneration of the muscle of dilated stomachs is probably to be
interpreted as a secondary change.It is probable that amyloid
degeneration may be a cause of atonic dilatation of the stomach.[10]
Oedematous infiltration of the coats of the stomach in cases of
cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary emphysema, cardiac disease, and
Bright's disease has been assigned as a cause of gastric dilatation,
but without satisfactory evidence.Chronic interstitial gastritis
(cirrhosis of the stomach) is more frequently a cause of contraction
than of dilatation of the stomach.[Footnote 10: Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.The restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach by adhesions and
by dragging downward of the organ in hernia may cause dilatation.Relaxation of the abdominal walls, as in women who have borne many
children, by removing the normal support of the stomach, has been
thought to cause dilatation.Atony of the muscular walls of the stomach may be a part of general
muscular weakness and impaired nutrition.Here belong cases of adynamic
dilatation of the stomach secondary to typhoid fever, cholera,
tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, cachexia, senile marasmus,
neurasthenia.Whether primary paralysis of the stomach can occur or not is wholly
uncertain.We have no positive knowledge as to the occurrence of
paresis of the stomach in consequence of organic or functional changes
{591} in the peripheral or central nervous system.Nor does our meagre
information as to the relation between the nervous system and the
muscular movements of the stomach justify the construction of any
hypotheses as to this point.For the sake of clearness the various causes of dilatation of the
stomach according to the foregoing classification may be recapitulated
as follows.Some of the more doubtful and of the rarer causes are
omitted:

  A. Stenosis of the Pylorus or of the Duodenum.Cancerous;
    2.Cicatricial;
    3.Hypertrophic (of pylorus);
    4.From external pressure;
    5.B. Abnormalities in Contents of Stomach.Ingesta:
      _a_.Excessive;
      _b_.Imperfectly masticated;
      _c_.Stagnation and fermentation in consequence of chemical
         insufficiency of the stomach, as in chronic catarrhal
         gastritis and functional dyspepsia.C. Impairment of Muscular Force of Stomach.Organic changes in muscular coat:
      _a_.Partial destruction by ulcers and cancers;
      _b_.Inflammation, as in chronic catarrhal gastritis and
             peritonitis;
      _c_.Degenerations (fatty, colloid, amyloid);
      _d_.;
      _e_.Mechanical Restraint:
      _a_.By adhesions;
      _b_.Impaired Nutrition and General Muscular Weakness, Adynamic
         dilatation from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anaemia, etc.As a rule, not a single one, but several, of the above-mentioned causes
are operative in the production of dilatation of the stomach, and it is
often impossible to say which is the primary cause.The various gastric
functions are so dependent upon each other that if one is disturbed the
others also suffer.If, for instance, atony of the muscular coat of the
stomach exists, then in consequence of enfeebled peristalsis the
secretion of gastric juice is insufficient, the food is not thoroughly
mingled with the gastric juice, and the absorption of the products of
digestion in the stomach is interfered with; in consequence of which
the accumulating peptones still further hinder the digestive process.The pylorus remains contracted for an abnormal length of time, as it
naturally is closed until the process of chymification in the stomach
is far advanced, and this process is now delayed.The stagnating
contents of the stomach readily ferment, and the irritating products of
fermentation induce a chronic {592} catarrhal gastritis, which further
impairs the functions of the mucous and muscular coats of the stomach.Thus, in a vicious circle one cause of dilatation induces another.To
assign to each cause its appropriate share in the production of the
final result is a matter of difficulty, and often of impossibility.From this point of view the dispute as to whether in atonic dilatation
the most important factor in causation is chemical insufficiency of the
stomach (impaired secretion of gastric juice, fermentations) or
mechanical insufficiency (weakened muscular action, stagnation),
appears of little practical importance.Of the causes of non-stenotic dilatation of the stomach, the first
place is to be assigned to chronic catarrhal gastritis and to atonic
dyspepsia, as this term is understood by most English and American
writers.As regards frequency, gastric dilatation is a common result of cancer
of the pylorus.It is less frequently caused by simple ulcer.Other
forms of pyloric stenosis than the cancerous and the cicatricial are
rare.Opinions differ as to the frequency of non-stenotic or atonic
dilatation of the stomach according to the manner in which one
interprets the cases.Non-stenotic dilatations which are comparable in
degree to those produced by stenosis are rare.The lesser grades of
atonic dilatation, however, are not rare; but here arises the
difficulty of distinguishing these cases from mere chemical or
mechanical insufficiency of the stomach, which often represents the
early stage of the process.Hence it has been proposed to discard
altogether the term dilatation, and to substitute that of insufficiency
of the stomach.But this latter term is applicable to many affections
of the stomach other than dilatation.A typical case of atonic
dilatation of the stomach is a well-defined disease, and because it is
difficult to diagnosticate its early stages is not sufficient reason
for discarding altogether the designation.Gastrectasia may develop at any age.It is most frequent in middle and
advanced life.The largest number of cases of atonic dilatation is met
with between thirty and forty years of age.[11] The disease occurs in all classes of life.Atonic
dilatation seems to be comparatively more frequent in private practice
and among the favorably situated than in hospitals and among the poor.Kussmaul says that the largest contingent of patients is furnished by
persons who lead a sedentary life and eat and drink a great deal.[Footnote 11: Kundrat and Widerhofer mention no case of stenotic
dilatation of the stomach in children.They say, however, that atonic
dilatation due to over-feeding, and particularly to rachitis, is not
infrequent in children.Widerhofer reports a case of very large
dilatation of the stomach in a girl twelve years old.The cause of the
dilatation was not apparent, and the clinical history was imperfect
(_Gerhardt's Handb.d. Kinderkrankh._, Bd.Lafage
(_These_, Paris, 1881) reports a case of gastric dilatation at ten
years, and another at sixteen years of age.R. Demme (abstract in
_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.1) reports a case of large
dilatation of the stomach in a boy six and a half years old.Cicatricial stenosis was suspected.Pauli (_De Ventriculi Dilatatione_,
Frankfurt, 1839) reports an enormous dilatation of the stomach,
believed to be due to congenital stenosis.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Inasmuch as dilatation of the stomach is usually
secondary to some other disease, the symptoms of the primary disease
have often existed a long time before those of dilatation appear.The subjective symptoms of gastric dilatation are for the most part
directly referable to disturbances of the functions of the stomach.These {593} subjective symptoms alone do not suffice for a positive
diagnosis of the disease.Of the greatest diagnostic importance are an
examination of the vomit and a careful physical exploration of the
stomach.The appetite with dilatation of the stomach may be normal, diminished,
increased, or perverted.In the majority of cases the appetite is
diminished, and there may be complete anorexia.Sometimes the appetite
is increased even to voracity, which is explicable by the small amount
of nutriment which is absorbed.Polyphagia may therefore be a result as
well as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.Often there is excessive thirst in consequence of the small quantity of
fluid absorbed.Dilatation of the stomach in itself does not usually cause sharp
epigastric pain, although it is often associated with painful diseases
of the stomach.There is usually in the region of the stomach a sense of fulness and
weight, which is often distressing and may be accompanied with dull
pain.Heartburn and eructations of gas and of bitter or of acid fluids are
frequently present.The gas is often odorless, but sometimes it is very
offensive.In a number of
cases--which, however, are exceptional--the gas has been found
inflammable, burning usually with a colorless flame (hydrogen), but
rarely, as in a case from Frerichs' clinic, with a bright
yellowish-white flame (hydrocarbons).Detonation upon setting fire to
the gas has been noted.The analysis of the inflammable gas has shown
oxygen and nitrogen in approximately the same proportion as in the
atmosphere, in addition to large quantities of carbonic acid and of
hydrogen, also marsh gas, and in Frerichs' case olefiant gas in small
amount.[12] The oxygen and nitrogen are doubtless simply swallowed, but
the carbonic acid and hydrogen are the result of abnormal fermentations
in the stomach.The origin of the hydrocarbons in the gas is not clear,
but they are probably also produced by fermentation within the stomach.[Footnote 12: One of the analyses in Frerichs' case gave carbonic acid,
17.40; hydrogen, 21.52; marsh gas, 2.71; olefiant gas, traces; oxygen,
11.91; nitrogen, 46.44.In another analysis were found marsh gas,
10.75, and olefiant gas, 0.20.Sulphuretted hydrogen was also present
(Ewald, in _Reichert und Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv_, 1874, p.One of the most frequent symptoms, although not a constant one, of
dilatation of the stomach is vomiting.This symptom often presents
characters which, if not pathognomonic of dilatation, at least raise a
strong presumption in favor of its presence.The act of vomiting is
sometimes accomplished with such ease that it is hardly more than
regurgitation; at other times the act is accompanied with violent and
exhausting retching.A feature particularly characteristic of
dilatation of the stomach is the abundance of the vomited material.In
no other disease is such an enormous quantity evacuated from the
stomach at one time.Blumenthal relates a case in which the vomited
material amounted to sixteen pounds.Such large quantities can
accumulate in the stomach of course only when a considerable time
intervenes between the acts of vomiting.The vomiting of gastric
dilatation does not generally occur until some hours after a meal.It
often presents a certain periodicity, occurring, for instance, at
intervals of two or three days, and followed usually by temporary
relief.It is often observed that as the stomach {594} becomes larger
and larger the vomiting becomes less and less frequent, but at the same
time more abundant.Especially toward a fatal termination of the
disease the walls of the stomach may become so paralyzed and
insensible, and the patient so feeble, that the vomiting ceases
altogether.Another valuable diagnostic sign furnished by the vomit is
the presence of undigested food which has been taken a considerable
time, it may be many days, previously.[13] If the morning vomit
habitually contains undigested food which has been eaten the previous
day, gastric dilatation either exists or is almost sure to develop.[Footnote 13: Ritter relates the case of a man who vomited cherry-pits,
although he had not eaten cherries for over a year (_Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1851, iii.The vomited matter is almost always in a condition of fermentation.If
the vomit be allowed to stand in a vessel, it will separate into three
layers--an upper, frothy; a middle, of turbid fluid, usually yellowish
or brownish in color; and a lower layer, composed of solid particles,
mostly alimentary debris.The vomit often emits an extremely offensive
odor.Different kinds of
fermentation--alcoholic, acetous, lactic acid, and butyric acid--are
present, usually in combination with each other.The microscope
reveals, besides undigested and partly-digested food, crystals of fatty
acids, sarcinae ventriculi, fungus-spores, and various forms of
bacteria, particularly rod-shaped ones.The connection between sarcinae
and fermentative processes is not understood.There is no evidence that
sarcinae are capable of causing fermentation.Of greater importance is
the recognition by the microscope of the spores of the yeast-fungus
(Torula cerevisiae).These spores are rarely absent, and their constant
presence is evidence that fermentation is in progress.Fermentation
often exists in undilated stomachs, but, as has already been mentioned,
it is an important factor in the production of dilatation, so that its
early recognition, if followed by proper treatment (washing out the
stomach especially), may ward off the development of dilatation.The
article on GASTRIC CANCER is to be consulted with reference to the
habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid from the stomach in cases of
cancerous dilatation.If cancer or ulcer of the stomach exists, blood
is frequently present in the vomit, but even in the absence of ulcer or
cancer or other demonstrable source of hemorrhage the vomit in cases of
dilatation of the stomach may exceptionally contain blood, even for a
considerable length of time.If the dilatation be due to pyloric
stenosis, bile is not often found in the vomited material.It has already been mentioned that vomiting is not a constant symptom
of dilatation of the stomach.It remains to add that vomiting may be
present without any of the distinctive features which have been
described.Gastric dilatation, especially in its early stages, is often
accompanied by attacks of acute indigestion (embarras gastrique) after
some indiscretion in diet.Constipation is an almost constant symptom of dilatation of the
stomach.This is naturally to be expected when so little substance
passes from the stomach into the intestine.The constipation is also to
be explained in part by the absence of the usual reflex stimulus which
the stomach during digestion normally exerts upon intestinal
peristalsis, for the constipation is usually much relieved when the
overweighted stomach is systematically washed out.{595} Occasionally, attacks of diarrhoea occur in cases of dilatation
of the stomach.The diarrhoea may perhaps be explained by the sudden
discharge of a large quantity of fermenting material from the stomach
into the intestine.With marked dilatation of the stomach, especially when there is profuse
vomiting, the urine is often considerably diminished in quantity.Particularly in cases treated by systematic washing out of the stomach,
but also in other cases, especially with abundant vomiting, the acidity
of the urine is often much reduced.The reaction may be even
continuously alkaline (Quincke).Crystals of phosphate of magnesium
have been occasionally found in the alkaline urine of gastrectasia
(Ebstein).The urine is prone to deposit abundant sediments.It often
contains an excess of indican.The patient may suffer from attacks of dyspnoea and of palpitation of
the heart in consequence of flatulent distension of the stomach.The general condition of the patient will of course depend chiefly upon
the character of the primary disease and upon the severity of the
gastric symptoms.A moderate degree of dilatation may exist without
much disturbance of the general health of the patient.But as the
disease progresses and the food stagnates more and more in the stomach,
finally to be rejected by vomiting, the patient cannot fail to lose
flesh and strength.In extreme cases of gastrectasia, even without
organic obstruction, the patient may be reduced to a degree of
emaciation and of cachexia indistinguishable from that of cancer.As in
so many other gastric diseases, the patient is usually mentally
depressed and hypochondriacal.He suffers much
from headache and vertigo.He feels incapable of physical or mental
exertion.The skin is dry and harsh; the extremities are cold.Toward
the last, cachectic oedema about the ankles can often be recognized.Kussmaul was the first to call attention to the occurrence of tetanic
spasms in cases of dilatation of the stomach.[14] This symptom has been
observed almost exclusively in an advanced stage of the disease when
the patient has become anaemic and weak.The spasms come on chiefly
after attacks of profuse vomiting or after evacuating large quantities
by the stomach-tube.The spasms may be preceded by a sense of pain or
distress in the region of the stomach, by dyspnoea, by numbness of the
extremities, or by great prostration.The tetanic spasms affect
especially the flexor muscles of the hand and forearm, the muscles of
the calves of the legs, and the abdominal muscles.The spasm may be
confined to one or more of these groups of muscles, or there may be
general tetanic contraction of the muscles of the body.Sometimes
typical epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness occur.With
general tetanic spasms the pupils are usually contracted, and often
irresponsive to light.Sometimes there is abnormal sensitiveness upon
pressure over the contracted muscles.The spasms may last for only a
few minutes, or they may continue for several hours, or even for days.After their disappearance the patient is left extremely prostrated.Although tetanic spasms increase the gravity of the prognosis, they are
not necessarily fatal.[Footnote 14: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul considers that these spasms are analogous to those occurring
in cholera, and are referable to abnormal dryness of the tissues in
consequence of the extraction of fluid.This view is supported by the
usual {596} occurrence of the spasms after profuse vomiting or after
washing out the stomach.Another explanation, which is perhaps more
applicable to the epileptiform attacks, refers the convulsions to
auto-infection by toxic substances produced in the stomach by abnormal
fermentative and putrefactive changes (Bouchard).[15]

[Footnote 15: Laprevotte, _Des Accidents tetaniformes dans la
Dilatation de l'Estomac_, These, Paris, 1884, p.Coma, with or without the peculiar dyspnoea of diabetic coma, is a rare
occurrence in gastrectasia.(For a description of this form of coma see
page 205.)The temperature in gastric dilatation is generally unaffected.Penzoldt, however, saw two cases with moderate rise of temperature in
the evening, which could not be explained by any complication.On the
other hand, abnormally low temperature with slow pulse has been
observed (Wagner).Essential to the diagnosis of gastric dilatation is the physical
examination of the stomach.If the stomach be markedly dilated, inspection may reveal an abnormal
prominence of the abdominal walls in the epigastric region and
extending a variable distance below the level of the umbilicus.This
prominence is most marked on the left side.When the abdominal walls
are sufficiently thin and relaxed, sometimes the outline of the greater
curvature between the umbilicus and pubes, less frequently that of the
lesser curvature, can be made out.Sometimes the peristaltic waves of
the stomach can be perceived through the thin abdominal walls.By
pressure or by passing the hand across the abdomen gastric peristalsis
may sometimes be excited.The peristaltic movements of the stomach,
however, are rarely perceived except when the dilatation is due to
stenosis and the muscular coat of the stomach is hypertrophied.The
peristaltic waves generally pass from left to right, rarely in the
opposite direction as well.Careful attention to the situation,
direction, and extent of these waves is necessary to distinguish them
from similar peristaltic movements of the intestine.[16] The diminution
in size of the abdominal prominence caused by a dilated stomach after
profuse vomiting or after washing out the stomach may aid in the
diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Kussmaul says that vigorous peristaltic movements of the
stomach may be perceptible through the abdominal walls even when there
is no dilatation of the stomach.Under these circumstances he
attributes the peristaltic commotion to an independent neurosis of the
stomach ("Die Peristaltische Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.An important aid in bringing out the contours of the stomach is the
artificial distension of the organ by the generation within it of
carbonic acid gas, as first suggested by Frerichs.For this purpose
20-30 grains of bicarbonate of sodium and 15-20 grains of tartaric
acid, each dissolved in a little lukewarm water, may be given one after
the other.If the stomach be much dilated and relaxed, it may be
necessary to give much larger quantities of the powders (up to 2-2-1/2
drachms of the soda and a corresponding quantity of the acid).It is
well to have a stomach-tube at hand in order to withdraw the gas in
case unpleasant symptoms develop.Sometimes the stomach fails to become
distended by this procedure.This is due in some cases to the escape of
the gas through the pyloric orifice into the intestine--a condition
designated by Ebstein as incontinence of the pylorus.It may be that
sometimes the gas produces such firm {597} contraction of the gastric
walls that the stomach does not expand by the pressure of the gas.Instead of generating gas, a similar result may be produced by simply
injecting air into the stomach through a stomach-tube, as recommended
by Oser and by Runeberg.The air may, however, escape along the side of
the tube.Palpation of the distended stomach yields an elastic resistance which
has been compared to that of an air-cushion.By palpating carefully
from above downward the greater curvature can sometimes be appreciated,
but in general it is difficult to distinguish it from the transverse
colon.Peristaltic movements may perhaps be appreciated by palpation
when they are not evident on inspection.If a dilated stomach contains
considerable fluid and the abdominal walls are yielding, fluctuation
may be perceived by palpation.The lowest level at which this
fluctuation can be felt may afford a clue as to the position of the
lower border of the stomach, but not much dependence can be placed upon
this sense of fluctuation unless many sources of error in its
interpretation are excluded.By pressing gently and repeatedly against the abdominal walls a
splashing sound can usually be heard in cases of well-marked dilatation
of the stomach (bruit de clapotement).This sound can best be brought
out when the patient is in the recumbent position, with relaxed
abdominal walls, by palpating near the left border of the ribs.The
same sound can be produced by shaking the patient (bruit de glou-glou).This sound may be heard at a considerable distance from the patient, to
whom it may be a source of much annoyance.In itself this splashing
sound is without diagnostic significance, as the condition for its
production--namely, the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid in the
stomach--exists often in healthy persons.By paying attention, however,
to the time at which this sound can be produced after eating or
drinking, and to its greater or less constancy, some diagnostic
importance can be attached to this sign.If the splashing sound can be
usually produced two hours or longer after the ingestion of liquid or
six hours after an ordinary meal, it generally indicates that
dilatation of the stomach exists.[17] It is necessary to exclude
somewhat similar sounds which may be produced in the intestines,
particularly in the transverse colon and caecum.The series of gurgling
sounds which may sometimes be produced in the intestine by palpation
are not likely to be confounded with the single splashing sound
produced in the stomach, but under certain circumstances a splashing
sound may be produced in the transverse colon which cannot be
distinguished from the gastric sound.If a dilated stomach contains a
very large quantity of fluid, the splashing sound cannot readily be
produced.[Footnote 17: Baradat, _Etude sur le Bruit de Clapotement stomacal_,
These, Paris, 1884.Baradat says that this bruit is also diagnostic of
dilatation when it can be produced by palpating below a horizontal line
passing through the junction of the ninth and tenth ribs, but it is
evident that motion might be transmitted to the stomach even when its
greater curvature is above this line by palpating below the level of
the umbilicus.]Leube has pointed out that the end of the stomach-tube (of course the
hard tube), after it has been inserted into the stomach, can often be
felt through the abdominal walls.[18] He says that if the tube can be
felt below a horizontal line passing through the anterior superior
spinous processes of the ileum, dilatation of the stomach may be
positively diagnosed, {598} and the existence of dilatation is probable
if the tube can be felt much below the umbilicus.No force should be
used in trying to make the end of the tube palpable.Of course if the
abdominal walls are thick or very tense the tube cannot be felt.Leube's method is simple and convenient, and applicable to many cases.As will be explained hereafter, a position of the lower border of the
stomach even quite as low as Leube's rule demands cannot be considered
by itself positive evidence of dilatation.[19]

[Footnote 18: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 19: According to Oser, there is a possible source of error in
Leube's method--namely, that the sound may slide along the greater
curvature of the stomach, and even reach the pylorus, so that the end
may be felt higher than the lowest point of the stomach.Considerable
objection has been made to Leube's method on the ground of its danger,
but this objection is based on the assumption that greater energy is
employed in pressing forward the sound than Leube recommends (Oser,
article "Magenerweiterung" in _Eulenburg's Real Encyclopadie_, Bd.The length to which the stomach-tube can be inserted before meeting
resistance may evidently give some idea as to the size of the stomach.The attempt, however, to establish any general law with reference to
this point has not proven successful.In many cases valuable information as to the size of the stomach is
afforded by percussion.Over the greater part of the stomach the
percussion note is tympanitic, sometimes with a metallic quality.Over
the most dependent part of the stomach a dull sound is produced on
percussion in case a sufficient quantity of fluid or solid material is
contained in the viscus.In the upright position, therefore, in
percussing over the stomach from above downward, the tympanitic note
gives place to a dull sound, and this zone of dulness will change with
the position of the patient, so that in the recumbent posture the
dulness may entirely disappear.In order to prove that the region of
dulness belongs to the stomach, Piorry caused the patient to drink a
large quantity of water (a pint to a quart).In a healthy empty stomach
this quantity of water suffices to produce a zone of dulness which does
not descend below the level of the umbilicus.If, however, the dulness
be produced below the level of the umbilicus, it is inferred that
dilatation exists.Penzoldt's modification of Piorry's method gives
more certain results.[20] By withdrawing the fluid from the stomach by
the stomach-tube the dulness may be made to disappear, and by injecting
more fluid the dulness may be made to reappear at will.By noting the
lower limit of the dulness thus produced the position of the lower
border of the stomach may be determined.The farther this lies below
the umbilicus the greater, presumptively, is the degree of dilatation.The artificial distension of the stomach with gas may also aid in
determining its limits by percussion.It must be said that in general
the separation of the lower limits of the stomach from the transverse
colon by means of percussion is a matter of great difficulty, and
sometimes is impossible.[Footnote 20: Penzoldt, _op.Upon auscultation over a dilated stomach sometimes a fine crackling or
sizzling sound, like that audible upon first uncorking a bottle of
soda-water, can be heard.[21] This is referable to the fermentation
which is in progress in the stomach.Eichhorst says that a similar but
finer crackling sound can be heard over a stomach in which carbonic
acid gas is {599} being artificially generated, and that this sound
abruptly ceases when the ear passes below the limits of the greater
curvature.[22]

[Footnote 21: Pauli was the first to record this phenomenon (_De
Ventriculi Dilatatione_, Frankfurt, 1839).]The displacement of neighboring organs by a dilated stomach does not
generally give rise to important physical signs.As the tendency of a
dilated stomach is to sink down in the abdomen, there is not usually
much displacement of the thoracic viscera.If, however, the fundus of
the stomach be distended with gas, the heart may be pushed upward, and,
being pressed against the chest-wall, its apex-beat may be more
forcible and diffused than normal.The tympanitic stomach may impart a
metallic quality to the cardiac sounds.MORBID ANATOMY.--Considerable degrees of dilatation of the stomach are
easily recognized by post-mortem examination.In extreme cases the
stomach occupies all of the anterior region of the abdomen, covering
over the intestines and extending down to the pubes or even into the
true pelvis.Many cases are recorded in which the stomach was capable
of holding six to twelve pints.Godon[23] describes under the name
ventriculi hydrops a hardly credible case in which it is said that the
stomach contained ninety pounds of fluid!In the ordinary cases of
gastrectasia the lower border of the stomach is found somewhere between
the umbilicus and the pubes, frequently about a hand's breadth below
the level of the umbilicus.de Hydrops Ventriculi_, London, 1646.This
celebrated case is described with much detail.For three years the
abdomen was enormously distended, but the patient, a woman, never
vomited.The affection was supposed to be dropsy of the peritoneum.Death occurred in a condition of extreme marasmus.The pylorus was the
seat of a hydatid cyst which extended into the duodenum.The stomach,
which was enormously distended, contained ninety pounds of fluid, in
which floated a great number of hydatid cysts, some of which were
ruptured.The anterior wall of the stomach was adherent to the parietal
peritoneum.The two orifices of the stomach were drawn close to each
other.The length of the stomach equalled a Paris ell.]The fundus, being the most dilatable part of the stomach, is in most
cases disproportionately dilated in comparison with the pyloric region.This excessive dilatation of the fundus is most noticeable in
gastrectasia due to stenosis.In most cases of dilatation the pylorus
sinks down somewhat in the abdomen, but in consequence of the
distension of the lower segment of the stomach the long axis of the
organ is more nearly transverse than normal.If the pylorus be fixed,
the lesser curvature may be drawn down in its middle so as to acquire a
hooked shape.The lesser curvature, which should be covered by the
liver, may be found considerably below its normal level.The dilated
fundus may extend from the left hypochondrium into the left iliac
region.[24]

[Footnote 24: Fogt reports a case in which an enormously dilated
stomach occupied a scrotal hernia of the left side.He refers to two
other similar cases (_Aerztl.Intelligenzbl._, 1884, No.More or less dilatation of the oesophagus is associated with marked
dilatation of the stomach.If dilatation of the stomach be due to
obstruction in the upper part of the intestine, then the pyloric
orifice and the intestine on the proximal side of the obstruction will
be found dilated.The walls of a dilated stomach may be hypertrophied, and such cases are
called hypertrophic dilatation; or the walls may be of normal thickness
or may be thinned, and these cases are called atrophic or atonic
dilatation.In general, the thickness of the gastric walls in
gastrectasia {600} depends upon that of the muscular coat.As a rule,
in cases of pyloric stenosis the muscular coat of the stomach is
hypertrophied.This hypertrophy affects chiefly the muscle of the
pyloric region.The gastric walls in stenotic dilatation may, however,
be of normal thickness or even atrophied.In non-stenotic dilatation
the muscular coat may be either hypertrophied or atrophied, but it
rarely attains the thickness observed in cases of gastrectasia due to
obstruction.Maier and others have repeatedly observed fatty and
colloid degeneration of the muscular fibres of dilated stomachs.[25]
More frequently, however, no degenerative change has been found in the
muscle.[Footnote 25: _Deutsches Archiv f. klin.cit._ Maier designates as colloid degeneration a
peculiar homogeneous, glistening appearance of the muscular fibres.This change is not such as would usually be called colloid, but this
term is loosely used to designate a great variety of pathological
changes.The form of muscular hypertrophy in gastrectasia is chiefly
the numerical.]The mucous membrane in dilatation of the stomach is usually in the
condition of chronic catarrhal gastritis.Although there are various
statements as to atrophy of the gastric tubules and degeneration of the
epithelial cells in the tubes in cases of gastric dilatation,
satisfactory histological investigations of the mucous membrane of the
stomach in this disease are wanting.[26]

[Footnote 26: For satisfactory studies of this nature it is desirable
that alcohol or some preservative fluid should be injected into the
stomach immediately after death.]Atrophy of various abdominal viscera--particularly of the spleen, which
is usually small in this disease--has been attributed to the pressure
of a dilated stomach.This atrophy, however, is probably in many cases
only a part of the general emaciation and anaemia.While well-marked cases of dilatation of the stomach cannot be mistaken
on post-mortem examination, it is important to add that the
pathological anatomist cannot always decide whether or not dilatation
of the stomach exists in the clinical sense.The following
considerations will make this evident: In the first place, the stomach
is a very variable organ as regards its size, so that it is impossible
to set definite limits, and say that a stomach exceeding these is
necessarily dilated, while a stomach not exceeding these limits is
normal.In the second place, it belongs to the clinical definition of
dilatation of the stomach that the organ is insufficient for the
performance of its normal functions.This insufficiency cannot be
determined at the post-mortem table.To determine, therefore, whether
stomachs which fall within certain not easily definable limits of size
are pathologically dilated or not, it is necessary to correct and
complete the results of the post-mortem examination by a knowledge of
the clinical history.[27]

[Footnote 27: To deny all value to post-mortem examination in the
determination of dilatation of the stomach, as has been done, is
absurd.In the majority of cases this examination affords satisfactory
evidence, but for some cases a reservation like that in the text must
be made.Rosenbach in an able article shows the error of regarding
dilatation of the stomach too exclusively from the anatomical point of
view ("Der Mechanismus und die Diagnose der Mageninsufficienz,"
_Volkmann's Samml.DIAGNOSIS.--A considerable degree of dilatation of the stomach can
generally be diagnosticated without difficulty by means of the symptoms
and physical signs which have been described.The most important
diagnostic features relate to the character of the vomiting and to the
physical signs, together with the information afforded by the use of
the {601} stomach-tube.The diagnostic characters of the vomiting are
the large quantity rejected, its occurrence several hours after a meal,
its periodicity with long intervals, the temporary relief afforded, the
presence of undigested food taken a considerable time previously, and
the existence of fermentation.Washing out the stomach will also afford
evidence of stagnation of food.The time generally occupied in the
digestion of an ordinary meal is not over six to seven hours, so that
in health the contents of the stomach removed by the stomach-tube at
the end of this time should usually be free from undigested food.There
are of course individual idiosyncrasies with reference to the time
occupied in digestion, so that implicit reliance cannot be placed on
this diagnostic test.Delayed digestion is in itself no evidence of the
existence of dilatation, but the establishment of the presence of this
symptom may confirm other points in the diagnosis.Simple inspection, palpation, and percussion of the abdomen are
sometimes, although rarely, sufficient for the diagnosis of dilatation
of the stomach.Various devices have already been described which aid
in the physical examination of the stomach, such as the administration
of effervescing powders, the introduction of the stomach-tube, and
Piorry's and Penzoldt's methods of determining the lower border of the
stomach.[28] It {602} is not necessary to repeat here the diagnostic
evidence afforded by physical examination.Excellent service as these
devices often perform, it must be confessed that they do not always
answer the purpose intended.The artificial distension of the stomach
with gas does not enable us always to distinguish intestine from
stomach.If the abdominal walls are thick or very rigid, this method,
like most of the others, is of little or no assistance.Then, as
already mentioned, the administration of the powders may fail to
produce any distension of the stomach, and may possibly mislead by
causing distension of intestine.Moreover, the artificial tympanites
may cause the patient much discomfort.The method of determining the
lower border of the stomach by Piorry's or Penzoldt's method is not
always conclusive.If the stomach be much dilated, it may take a very
large quantity of water to produce an appreciable zone of dulness.If
the transverse colon be distended with feces, it will not be easy to
separate the dulness of the stomach from that of the colon.Moreover,
loops of intestine containing feces or gas may lie over the anterior
surface of the stomach.The use of the stomach-tube simply for
diagnostic purposes is, for various reasons, not always practicable.With due recognition of the important additions during the last few
years to our means of exploring the stomach, it must be admitted that
we are still far from any positive and universally applicable method of
determining the size and position of this organ during life.This
admission is the more necessary in view of the extravagant claims which
have been made for various more or less complicated contrivances for
physical exploration of the stomach.[Footnote 28: Several other methods have been suggested for determining
the size and position of the stomach, but they have not found general
acceptance.Thus, Schreiber attaches a soft rubber balloon to the end
of a stomach-tube, and after its insertion in the stomach inflates it
(_Deutsches Arch.In Neubauer's method the long
end of a syphon-tube communicating with the stomach is bent upward, and
a glass tube is placed in the bent portion.The fluid will evidently
stand at the same level in the tube as in the stomach in case the
atmospheric pressure in both is the same.The atmospheric pressure in
the stomach is produced by using a double tube or by passing a second
tube into the stomach (_Prager med.Wochenschr._, 1879).Purjesz
attached a manometer to a stomach-tube, and thought that he could fix
the position of the cardia by noting the moment when in the passage
downward of the tube the negative pressure changed to positive, but
Schreiber has shown that the manometer may indicate negative pressure
even after the tube has entered the stomach (_Deutsches Arch.It has been asserted that by means of
auscultatory percussion of a stomach artificially distended with gas
the boundaries of the organ can be determined.Leichtenstern considers
the metallic quality of the tone heard over the stomach under these
circumstances more or less characteristic, while Skamper compares the
characteristic tone to that produced by tapping with the finger on the
dorsal surface of the hand of which the valar surface is placed against
the external ear (_Inaug.Diss._, Berlin, 1879, p.It has been
claimed that the sound as of water dropping into a large cavity, which
can be heard when the patient is drinking, can no longer be heard when
the auscultating ear passes beyond the greater curvature (V.
Bamberger).Wunderlich suggests the possibility of feeling the arteries
of the greater curvature through the abdominal walls.Ferber calls
attention in cases of gastrectasia to a strip of dulness, with absent
vocal and respiratory sounds, corresponding to the posterior inferior
border of the left lung.This dulness, which is produced by material in
the most dependent part of the dilated stomach, disappears when the
patient assumes the knee-elbow position (_Deutsche Zeitschr.When it is impossible by other methods to
distinguish the lower portion of the stomach from the transverse colon,
it has been proposed to distend the colon with water, with gas, or with
air injected through a tube passed into the rectum.cit._) found that the length of a tube (hard) or bougie reaching the
bottom of the stomach, estimating from the upper incisor teeth, should
be in a normal stomach at least 5 cm.less than that of the vertebral
column (occiput to coccyx), and at the most not much more than
one-third of the length of the body (1:2.8-1:3.3).In three cases of
gastrectasia he found the length of the tube inserted into the stomach
considerably more than one-third of the length of the body (1:2.4); in
one of the cases this length even exceeded that of the vertebral
column, and in the others it nearly equalled the length of the
vertebral column.Rosenbach's method of determining the elastic and
contractile power of the stomach is ingenious, but hardly of practical
utility.By injecting air into the stomach through a bulb apparatus
attached to the end of a stomach-tube, he is able to tell when the
point of the tube passes beneath the surface of fluid in the stomach by
hearing on auscultation a characteristic moist bubbling sound.Elevation or depression of the level of the fluid can be determined by
withdrawing or by pushing forward the tube.That quantity of fluid
which, introduced into an empty stomach, causes no elevation, or
perhaps causes a depression, of the level of the food in the stomach,
indicates the utmost limit of the elastic and contractile forces of the
stomach (Rosenbach, _Volkmann's Samml.The determination of the position of the lower border of the stomach
does not in itself enable us to infer positively the size of the organ.It may be taken as a general rule that if the lower border of the
stomach be found persistently below the level of the umbilicus, the
stomach is dilated; but there are many exceptions to this rule.Sometimes an otherwise normal stomach preserves in adult life the
vertical position which it had in the foetus, so that its lowest point
may be below the umbilicus.According to Kussmaul, a vertical position
of the stomach is a predisposing cause of dilatation.Occasionally a
stomach has a looped shape, so that without any dilatation of the organ
the lowest point may fall below the level of the umbilicus.It is,
moreover, a clinical fact established by the experience of many
observers that the lower border of the stomach may be found below the
level of the umbilicus without the existence of any symptoms of
dilatation.The uncertainty of the anatomical diagnosis of dilatation of the
stomach in some cases makes it all the more necessary, as has been
repeatedly urged in the course of this article, to make a careful study
of the evidences of disordered gastric functions.The symptoms of most
importance in determining whether the condition called insufficiency of
the stomach is present or not are fermentation of the gastric contents
and the {603} persistent presence of undigested food in the stomach
beyond the limits of normal digestion.It is true that these symptoms
may be present without any dilatation of the stomach, but they are
likely to lead to dilatation if unchecked, and, what is of practical
importance, they require essentially the same treatment as dilatation.A differential diagnosis between chronic catarrhal gastritis and atonic
dyspepsia on the one hand, and the early stages of dilatation of the
stomach on the other, cannot be made with any positiveness.Of course, with our present means of diagnosis the confounding of
dilated stomachs with ascites, ovarian cysts, pregnancy, hydatid cysts
(of each of these errors there are recorded instances), is inexcusable.PROGNOSIS AND COURSE.--The prognosis of dilatation of the stomach
depends first of all upon the nature of the primary disease causing the
dilatation.The prognosis of cancerous dilatation is as unfavorable as
possible.In dilatation due to non-cancerous stenosis the prognosis is
in general more favorable.Life may be prolonged sometimes for many
years, and the patient's condition greatly benefited by proper
treatment.A permanent cure of stenotic dilatation is not impossible,
but it is rarely to be expected.Even if temporarily relieved, the
symptoms of dilatation are likely sooner or later to return and to lead
to a fatal termination.The progress of the disease depends upon the
degree and the stationary or advancing character of the stenosis.In
the article on GASTRIC ULCER mention has been made of the cure of a few
cases of desperate gastric dilatation due to cicatricial pyloric
stenosis by means of resection of the diseased pylorus.In general, the prognosis is more favorable in dilatation without
stenosis.If the degree of dilatation be only moderate, a permanent
cure may often be effected by proper treatment.If, however, the
dilatation be considerable, while the symptoms may be relieved or even
made to disappear for a time, relapses are prone to occur, and a
permanent cure is rarely obtained.Undoubtedly, Kussmaul's publication
in 1869, in giving to us a most valuable method of treatment, at the
same time raised extravagant expectations of the frequency with which
dilatation of the stomach can be cured.Too often the treatment with
the stomach-tube proves only palliative and not curative.The course of dilatation of the stomach is chronic.The mode of death
is usually by inanition, very rarely from rupture of the stomach.TREATMENT.--Reference to the causation of dilatation of the stomach
will show that there is considerable scope for the prophylactic
treatment of dilatation not referable to stenosis or incurable organic
disease.Thus, the correction of the habits of eating or drinking
inordinate quantities, or of imperfectly masticating the food in
consequence of haste or bad teeth or vicious custom, may avert the
development of gastric dilatation.Of especial importance is the timely
treatment of cases of dyspepsia or of chronic catarrhal gastritis which
are accompanied with fermentation or delayed digestion--conditions in
which the stomach-tube is of great service.Of the means at our disposal for meeting the causal and the symptomatic
indications of dilatation of the stomach, the most important by far is
the use of the stomach-tube for the purpose of emptying and of washing
out the stomach.The introduction of this procedure by Kussmaul in 1867
marked a new era in the treatment of gastric disorders.{604} By washing out the stomach we accomplish three important things:
first, we remove the weight which helps to distend the organ; secondly,
we remove mucus and stagnating and fermenting material which irritates
and often inflames the stomach and impedes digestion; and, thirdly, we
cleanse the inner surface of the stomach and obtain the beneficial
influence of the direct application of water, to which various
medicinal substances can be added.It is probable that in removing the
fermenting contents of the stomach we also remove a possible source of
self-infection of the system (see page 596).By accomplishing these things we may possibly also enable the stomach
to regain its lost elasticity and muscular contractility.But unless
the normal elastic and contractile powers of the stomach are restored,
the treatment with the stomach-tube, indispensable as it is for the
relief of symptoms, is only palliative and not curative.Whether or not
this restoration of the stomach to its normal functional activity is to
be expected depends chiefly upon the cause and the degree of the
dilatation.Unfortunately, as has already been stated under Prognosis,
the permanent cure of dilatation of the stomach due to organic
stenosis, although possible, is not to be expected, and the number of
cases in which largely dilated stomachs can be restored to their normal
volume or made to perform permanently their normal functions is small.There remains, however, a considerable number of curable cases--to be
sure, not always easily diagnosticated--in which the muscular coat of
the stomach has not been seriously damaged and in which the dilatation
is generally only moderate.Furthermore, excellent results are obtained
by the use of the stomach-tube in the cases which have been designated
insufficiency of the stomach, and which are closely allied to
dilatation--in fact, often represent its early stage.As has already
been mentioned, the most important criteria of this so-called
insufficiency are the fermentation of the contents of the stomach and
the presence therein of undigested food after the period required for
normal digestion (six to seven hours for an ordinary meal).There are two principal methods of washing out the stomach--one by the
stomach-pump, the other by the siphon process.The stomach-pump is the
older method, and still has its advocates.The pump used by Kussmaul is
the Wyman pump, described by Bowditch in the _American Journal of
Medical Sciences_, vol.This (which is also called
the Weiss pump), as well as other forms of stomach-pump, consists in
principle simply of an aspirating syringe having at its anterior
extremity two openings communicating with the barrel of the syringe.These openings can be alternately opened and closed by means of an
arrangement of valves.Through one opening, which is made to
communicate with an incompressible tube inserted into the stomach (the
other opening being now closed), the gastric contents are drawn into
the barrel of the syringe.This opening is now closed, and through the
other opening the contents of the syringe are discharged through a tube
externally.In a similar way fluid can be drawn into the syringe and
pumped into the stomach.In the siphon process the outer end of the tube inserted into the
stomach is connected with a piece of elastic tubing about three and a
half feet long, in the free end of which is inserted the extremity of a
medium-sized glass funnel.A single elastic tube about six feet long
may also be used.{605} When the funnel is elevated, water which has
been poured into it will run into the stomach.If now, before the water
has all run out, the funnel be depressed below the level of the
stomach, the fluid contents of the stomach will flow out through the
tube according to the principle of the siphon.20 and 21 will
make clear the mode of operation of this process.(The tube shown in
these figures is the Faucher tube, commonly used in France, and
consisting, with the funnel, of one piece.A longer tube than that
shown in the figure should be used.)[29]]

[Illustration: FIG.[29]]

[Footnote 29: From Souligoux, _De la Dilatation de l'Estomac_, Paris,
1883.]Another convenient but somewhat more complicated method of employing
the siphon process is according to Rosenthal's principle, and is
represented in Fig.To the outer end of the stomach-tube is
attached a Y-shaped glass tube, one arm of which is connected with an
elastic tube running to an irrigator, while the other arm is connected
with the discharging tube.Through the irrigating tube water runs into
the stomach, the discharging tube being compressed.If the discharging
tube be opened while the fluid is flowing from the irrigator, and if
then, after the establishment of a column of water in the discharging
tube, the irrigating tube be compressed or the stopcock of the
irrigator be closed, a siphon communicating with the stomach is formed
and empties this organ of its fluid contents.[30]]

[Footnote 30: From Leube, in _Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.In the siphon process the tube inserted into the stomach may be an
incompressible hard-rubber tube like that employed with the
stomach-pump, but by far the simplest, most convenient, and safest form
of stomach-tube is the soft, flexible, red rubber tube, resembling the
Jacques catheter, but of course larger and longer.[31] This soft tube
can inflict no {606} injury, and in most cases it is readily
introduced.Generally, the patient himself can best manipulate the
introduction of the tube.After the tube is introduced into the
pharynx, the patient, who should be in a sitting posture, makes
repeated acts of swallowing, by means of which, accompanied by
directing and gently pushing the tube with the fingers, the tube passes
along the oesophagus into the stomach.Often at first the nervousness
and inexperience of the patient occasion some trouble, but after a
little practice he generally succeeds in introducing the tube without
discomfort or difficulty.Before its introduction the tube should be
anointed with a little vaseline or some similar substance.In an adult
the tube is introduced for a length of at least 20 to 25 inches, and in
cases of dilatation of the stomach of course for a greater distance.Whatever form of stomach-tube be used, it is important that the tube
should be at least 30 inches long, and should be provided with one, and
preferably with two, large eyes at its distal extremity.[Footnote 31: Such a tube (marked 19 A) is made by Tieman & Co.of New
York, and is to be had of most surgical instrument-makers.(For a
fuller description of the tube and the mode of its employment see
article by W. B. Platt, "The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the
Stomach," _Maryland Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884.)Oser's tube is 2 meters long, and is made of mineralized rubber.The smaller has a lumen of 8 mm.The thickness of the
wall is 2-1/2 mm.In the larger tube the lumen is 10 mm., and the
thickness of the wall 3 mm.Faucher's tube is 1-1/2 meters long.The external diameter of the tube
is 10 to 12 mm.The walls are of such thickness that the tube can be
bent without effacing its lumen.At one extremity is a lateral eye with
two orifices.To the other extremity is adapted a funnel with a
capacity of about 500 grammes.]Although the stomach-pump has the advantage of more completely
evacuating the stomach and of removing coarser solid particles than is
possible with the siphon, nevertheless its disadvantages--namely, the
possibility of inflicting injury to the mucous membrane of the
stomach,[32] the expense and greater complexity of the instrument, and
the circumstance that it should be used only by the physician--in
contrast with the advantages of the siphon--namely, its cheapness,
simplicity, safety, and possible employment by the patient or his
attendants--have led to the general adoption of the latter process.Only the soft-rubber stomach-tube should be left to the employment of
the patient.[Footnote 32: A number of cases have been recorded in which pieces of
the mucous membrane of the stomach have been detached by the
stomach-pump.Although as yet no serious effects have followed this
accident, the possibility of its occurrence can certainly not be
regarded with equanimity.]Sometimes the flow through the siphon is interrupted by occlusion of
the eye of the stomach-tube by a solid mass or by some cause not always
clear.As already mentioned, it is desirable that there should be two
openings at the gastric extremity of the tube.When the flow is {607}
interrupted the position of the tube in the stomach may be changed, or
the patient may be directed to cough or to exert the pressure of the
abdominal muscles, or more water may be allowed to run into the stomach
in order to displace an occluding mass in the tube.It is, however,
well for such cases to have, if possible, a stomach-pump and an
incompressible tube in reserve.Moreover, as is apparent from the
foregoing statement of the advantages of the stomach-pump, there are
cases in which this instrument is much more useful than the siphon, so
that one cannot decide unconditionally in favor of one instrument over
the other.The stomach-tube should be secured so that there can be no possibility
of its being swallowed entirely.A string may be attached to the distal
end of the tube.Leube[33] has reported an instance in which the whole
tube disappeared into the stomach, and Jackson[34] has also narrated a
case in which an insane patient swallowed the stomach-tube.In both
cases the tube was subsequently rejected by vomiting.[Footnote 33: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 34: _Extracts from the Records of the Boston Society for
Medical Improvement_, vol.For washing out the stomach after the greater part of the contents have
been withdrawn, about a pint of tepid fluid is allowed to slowly run
into the stomach, and is then siphoned out.This process is to be
repeated several times.In general, tepid water suffices for washing
out the stomach, but it is often better to use, at least a part of the
time, a 1 to 2 per cent.solution of bicarbonate of sodium, which
facilitates the removal of mucus.The artificial and the natural Vichy
and Carlsbad waters are also excellent for this purpose.Various
additions are also made to the water with the view of counteracting
fermentative changes in the stomach.For this purpose perhaps the best
agents are salicylate of sodium (1 per cent.solution) or resorcin (2
per cent.Other substances which have also been recommended
are carbolic acid, permanganate of potassium, hyposulphite of sodium,
creasote, benzine.Simple water, however, accomplishes about all that
is possible, and many are satisfied to use it without any medication.As regards the frequency with which the stomach is to be washed out,
one is to be guided by the symptoms and the effect obtained by the use
of the stomach-tube.As a general rule, it suffices to wash out the
stomach once a day, and often the process need be repeated only every
second or third day.Opinions are divided as to the best time of day to select for washing
out the stomach.Kussmaul recommends the morning before breakfast, and
the majority have followed his advice; others prefer the evening.There
is much, however, in favor of washing out the stomach about half an
hour before the principal meal of the day.The best opportunity has
been offered for the digestion and absorption of the food taken at the
previous main meal, and the stomach is placed in the best possible
condition for the reception of more food.The habitual washing out of the stomach is not without its drawbacks.We often remove, as has been pointed out especially by Leube, not only
noxious substances from the stomach, but also the completed products of
digestion.To withdraw from the nourishment of the body this chyme
which the stomach has laboriously manufactured cannot be a matter of
indifference.Still, with the weakened absorptive powers of the
stomach, {608} and its inability to properly propel its contents into
the intestine, it is a question how much of this chyme would eventually
be utilized for nutrition.The
relief which the patient experiences when his overloaded stomach is
freed of its burden, and the knowledge that this method of relief is
always at hand, may make him careless in the observance of the dietetic
rules which are of great importance in the treatment of this disease.It is well, therefore, not to wash out the stomach oftener than is
necessary, nor to continue the habitual use of the stomach-tube longer
than is required.There are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.In very
rare instances the attempt to introduce the tube causes the patient so
much distress, produces such violent spasm of the pharyngeal and
adjacent muscles, or induces so much retching and vomiting, or is
attended with such prostration or even syncope, that this method of
treatment has to be abandoned.Great weakness, recent gastric
hemorrhage, ulcer of the stomach in most cases (see page 523), often
cancer of the cardia or of the oesophagus, and aneurism of the aorta,
are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.If we group together the results obtained by the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric dilatation, we shall find cases in which no
benefit results; cases which are benefited, but are obliged to continue
the use of the stomach-tube throughout life; cases in which recovery is
slow and gradual; cases with more or less speedy relief or apparent
cure, but followed by relapses; and cases of prompt relief and
permanent cure.The regulation of the diet is never to be neglected in cases of
dilatation of the stomach.Here the guiding principles are that little
fluid should be taken, and that the food should be small in bulk,
nutritious, easily digestible, and not readily undergoing fermentation.The patient should drink as little water as possible, and should
therefore avoid whatever occasions thirst.It is hardly practicable to
carry out the plan of giving water mostly by the rectum, as has been
proposed.In most cases milk is useful, but an exclusively milk diet is
not generally well borne on account of the quantity of fluid required.Leube's beef-solution is often serviceable.Soft-boiled eggs and tender
meats are to be allowed, particularly the white meat of fowl and rare
beefsteak, especially that prepared from scraped and finely-chopped
beef, as recommended in the treatment of gastric ulcer (page 521).Fatty, saccharine, and amylaceous articles of food--hence most
vegetables and fruits--are to be avoided on account of their tendency
to undergo fermentation in the stomach.Alcohol in any form is usually
detrimental.If gastric symptoms, particularly vomiting, be very
urgent, or if food introduced into the stomach affords little or no
nourishment, as in some cases of tight pyloric stricture, then rectal
alimentation is to be resorted to.An important indication is to restore the tone and contractile power of
the muscular coat of the stomach.For this purpose electricity, in the
form both of the constant and of the faradic current, has been
beneficially employed.The best results are reported from the use of
the faradic current.Both poles may be applied over the region of the
stomach.The application of electricity to the inside of the stomach by
means of electrodes attached to stomach-tubes or bougies is a more
{609} difficult procedure, but has its advocates.Uniformly good
results are not obtained by the use of electricity in gastric
dilatation, but there can be no doubt that in some cases decided
benefit follows this method of treatment.Nux vomica, particularly its alkaloid strychnia, has been much employed
with the view of stimulating the muscular power of the stomach.Strychnia is given either internally or hypodermically.Hypodermic
injections of ergotin have also been used for the same purpose.It has
been hoped to increase the contraction of the stomach by cold
applications to the abdomen, as by ice-bags applied immediately after
washing out the stomach.The benefit derived from these various
attempts to increase the tonicity of the gastric muscle is not very
apparent.A belt or bandage around the abdomen in order to support the stomach
sometimes makes the patient feel more comfortable; in other cases it
aggravates the symptoms.In many cases digestion is promoted by giving dilute hydrochloric acid
with or without pepsin.About ten drops of dilute hydrochloric acid may
be given half an hour to an hour after each meal.When the stomach is systematically washed out, the individual symptoms
of dilatation of the stomach will rarely require special treatment.The
sensation of fulness and weight in the stomach, the eructations, the
vomiting, and the constipation are generally relieved, at least
temporarily, by washing out the stomach.The appetite is improved, and
an increase in weight is usually soon noticeable.If heartburn and eructations of gas continue troublesome, an antacid,
such as bicarbonate of sodium or prepared chalk, will be found useful.Leube, in order to relieve constipation and to increase the peristalsis
of the stomach, administers Carlsbad water (see page 522).Not more
than five or six ounces of the water need be given, and this should be
taken slowly in divided doses.A laxative pill containing rhubarb may
be given occasionally.If anaemia be the cause or a prominent accompaniment of dilatation of
the stomach, iron may be administered in a form as little disturbing
the digestion as possible, as the effervescing citrate or the lactate,
or arsenic in the form of Fowler's solution may be tried.In general,
however, all drugs which impair the appetite or digestion are to be
withheld.The digestion and the general condition of the patient are
often benefited by massage.Resection of the pylorus in cases of cancerous and of cicatricial
stenosis of this orifice has been performed in several instances.The
subject, as regards its medical in distinction from its surgical
bearings, has already been discussed in connection with cancer of the
stomach (see page 577).Here it may be added that the propriety of
resection is less open for dispute in cases of non-cancerous pyloric
stenosis than it is in cancer of the pylorus.Remarkable results have been reported by Loreta in cases of cicatricial
stenosis of the pylorus.After performing gastrotomy he inserts his
fingers through the constricted pyloric orifice and forcibly dilates
the stricture.[35] To judge from experience in divulsing strictures in
other parts of {610} the body, it does not seem probable that a
permanent cure can be often effected by this bold and dangerous
procedure.[Footnote 35: Loreta has performed this operation successfully no less
than nine times (_The Lancet_, April 26, 1884).]Acute Dilatation of the Stomach.Under the name acute dilatation of the stomach[36] have been described
cases in which it has been supposed that a more or less suddenly
developed paralysis of the muscular coat of the stomach exists.But the
propriety of the term acute dilatation, and the very existence of an
acute paralysis of the stomach, are, to say the least, questionable.[Footnote 36: The literature pertaining to the subject of acute
dilatation of the stomach is to be found in Poensgen, _Die Motorischen
Verrichtungen des Menschlichen Magens_, Strasburg, 1882, p.As causes of this so-called acute dilatation of the stomach have been
assigned injuries, particularly those affecting the abdomen, surgical
operations involving the peritoneum, acute inflammations of the mucous
and of the peritoneal coats of the stomach, acute fevers, especially
during convalescence, and overloading the stomach with food or with
liquids.The symptoms which have been chiefly emphasized are severe abdominal
pain, tympanitic distension of the stomach, and absence or cessation of
vomiting if this has previously existed.It will be noted that
inability to vomit under these circumstances implies not only paralysis
of the stomach, but also that of the abdominal muscles.The prognosis depends on the character of the primary disease causing
the alleged paralysis.If there be acute distension of the stomach with inability of the organ
to expel its contents either externally or into the intestine, the
stomach-tube may be employed to evacuate the gas and other material
present.In a case described by Hilton Fagge[37] as acute dilatation of the
stomach the symptoms of dilatation appeared suddenly and ran an acute
course, but the autopsy showed that the dilatation was doubtless of
much longer development than the symptoms indicated.In a case reported
by Nauwerk[38] of extreme dilatation in consequence of hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus, after ten months of insignificant dyspeptic
symptoms there suddenly appeared, after excess in eating, symptoms of
dilatation of great severity, which continued until a fatal termination
at the end of three months.Thus it appears that chronic dilatation of
the stomach may cause little disturbance for a considerable time and
then run a rapid course.[Footnote 37: "On Acute Dilatation of the Stomach," _Guy's Hosp.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.{611}

MINOR ORGANIC AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH.(CIRRHOSIS; HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF PYLORUS; ATROPHY; ANOMALIES IN THE
FORM AND THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH; RUPTURE; GASTROMALACIA.)BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.CIRRHOSIS OF THE STOMACH.DEFINITION.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is characterized by thickening of
the walls of the greater part or of the whole of the stomach in
consequence of a new growth of fibrous tissue, combined usually with
hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the stomach.The cavity of the
stomach is usually contracted, but sometimes it is of normal size or
even dilated.SYNONYMS.--Fibroid induration of the stomach; Hypertrophy of the walls
of the stomach; Chronic interstitial gastritis; Sclerosis of the
stomach; Plastic linitis.HISTORY.--The writings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
contain many records of extremely contracted stomachs with uniformly
and greatly thickened walls (Butzen, Loseke, Storck, Portal, Lieutaud,
Pohl, etc.).In the works of Lieutaud and of Voigtel may be found
references to many such cases.[1] Doubtless, some of these cases were
examples of cirrhosis of the stomach, but in the absence of
microscopical examination it is not possible to separate these from
cancer.[Footnote 1: Lieutaud, _Historia anat.-med._, t. i. p.8, Venet., 1779;
Voigtel, _Handb.Here it
may be mentioned that Diemerbroeck's case, which is so often quoted to
prove that polyphagia instead of causing gastric dilatation may produce
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, with contraction, was
probably an instance of cirrhosis of the stomach.]Andral[2] was the first to describe fully and systematically
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach.He attributed the lesion to
chronic inflammation.He erroneously supposed that scirrhus of the
stomach was only hypertrophy of the gastric walls.Cruveilhier[3]
distinguished between scirrhous induration and hypertrophy, which he
considered to be a final result of the irritation accompanying chronic
diseases of the stomach.Rokitansky's[4] description of fibroid
induration of the stomach, although brief, is accurate.He says that
the process usually involves the whole {612} stomach, and that it
originates in an inflammation of the submucous connective tissue.This
inflammation may occur either independently or in combination with
gastritis mucosa.Rokitansky emphasizes the error of confounding the
disease with scirrhous cancer.Bruch[5] made an elaborate study of
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach, which he considered to be the
final stage of various chronic diseases of the stomach.Fibrous or
scirrhous cancer he considered to be nothing but this hypertrophy.[Footnote 2: _Precis d'Anat.[Footnote 3: _Anatomie pathologique_, Paris, 1830-42.]Anat._, Wien, 1855-61.]The best descriptions of cirrhosis of the stomach have been furnished
by English writers, by most of whom it is properly regarded as an
independent disease.Brinton[6] first employed the names cirrhosis of
the stomach and plastic linitis.Excellent descriptions of the disease
have been given by Hodgkin, Budd, Brinton, Habershon, H. Jones, Wilks,
Quain, and Smith.[Footnote 6: _Diseases of the Stomach_.]While in former times cirrhosis of the stomach was confounded with
cancer, in recent times it has not been separated by many from chronic
catarrhal gastritis.In German systematic works the disease receives,
as a rule, only passing mention in connection with chronic catarrhal
gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is rare, but it is not so
exceptional as to be without any clinical importance.I have met with
three cases at post-mortem examination.The disease is more frequent in men than in women.A considerable
number of cases have occurred between thirty and forty years of age,
but the greatest frequency is after forty.At an earlier age than
twenty the disease is very rare.The causation of cirrhosis of the stomach is obscure.Nearly all
writers upon the subject have emphasized the abuse of alcohol as an
important cause in this as in other diseases of the stomach.Intemperance cannot, however, be the only cause; and here, as
elsewhere, it is not easy to say what importance is to be attached to
it as an etiological factor.In only one of the three cases which I
examined post-mortem could it be determined that the patient was an
immoderate drinker, and in one case intemperance could be positively
excluded.Other cases have been recorded in which the abuse of spirits
could be positively excluded.In one of my cases syphilis existed, as
was established by the presence of gummata in the liver.In some cases
the disease has been attributed to cicatrization of a gastric ulcer.In
a case reported by Snellen the disease followed an injury to the
epigastric region.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Canstatt's Jahresbericht_, 1856, iii.Cirrhosis of the stomach, as well as cancer, ulcer, and most other
chronic structural diseases of this organ, is usually associated with
chronic catarrhal gastritis.There is, however, no proof of the
prevalent idea that chronic catarrhal gastritis is the cause of the
enormous new growth of fibrous tissue which characterizes typical cases
of this disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS.--The symptoms of cirrhosis of the stomach
are not sufficiently characteristic to warrant a positive diagnosis.Like cancer of the
stomach, it may put on various disguises.Thus, in a case of cirrhosis
of the stomach reported by Nothnagel[8] the symptoms were {613}
typically those of progressive pernicious anaemia.Association with
ascites or with chronic peritonitis may lead to a false diagnosis.Thus, in one of the cases which I examined after death, and in which
there was chronic peritonitis with abundant fluid exudation, the
disease during life was diagnosticated as cirrhosis of the liver.Most
frequently, however, cirrhosis of the stomach is mistaken for gastric
cancer, from which, in fact, it can rarely be positively
diagnosticated.[Footnote 8: _Deutsches Arch.The symptoms are usually those of chronic dyspepsia, which sooner or
later assumes a severity which leads to the diagnosis of some grave
structural disease of the stomach, usually of cancer.Indigestion, loss of appetite, oppression in the epigastrium, vomiting,
are the common but in no way characteristic symptoms of cirrhosis of
the stomach.There may be severe gastralgia, but in general the disease
is less painful than either ulcer or cancer of the stomach.The
inability to take more than a small quantity of food or of drink at a
time, with the sense of fulness which even this small quantity
occasions, has been considered somewhat characteristic of cirrhosis of
the stomach, but this symptom is too inconstant, and occurs in too many
other affections of the stomach, to be of much service in diagnosis.The symptoms of dyspepsia are often of much longer duration than in
cancer, existing sometimes for many years (up to fifteen years), but on
the other hand there have been cases in which the clinical history of
gastric cirrhosis was as rapid in its progress as cancer.Moreover,
cancer may be preceded by dyspeptic symptoms of long duration, but long
duration is the exception with cancer and the rule with cirrhosis of
the stomach.As the disease progresses the patient loses flesh and strength, and
usually dies in a condition of marasmus.Blood is rarely present in the
vomit, but in a few cases the vomiting of coffee-ground material has
been noted.By physical examination sometimes a tumor in the region of the stomach
can be felt.Under favorable circumstances it can sometimes be
determined that this tumor is smooth, elastic, tympanitic on
percussion, and presents more or less distinctly the contours of the
stomach.By administering effervescing powder it may be possible to
obtain further evidence that the tumor corresponds in its form to the
stomach.The diagnosis of contraction of the cavity of the stomach is
not easy.Some information may be afforded by noting the length to
which the inflexible stomach-tube can be passed.The quantity of water
which can be poured into the stomach until it begins to run out of the
stomach-tube may also bring some confirmatory evidence as to the
existence of contraction of the stomach.Even should the physical signs suffice to determine that the tumor is
the thickened and contracted stomach, still cancer cannot be excluded,
for this also may grow diffusely in the gastric walls and may cause
contraction of the cavity of the stomach.With our present means of
diagnosis, therefore, the most which can be said is, that a special
combination of favorable circumstances may render probable the
diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach, but a positive diagnosis is
impossible.MORBID ANATOMY.--In most cases of cirrhosis of the stomach the stomach
is contracted.The cavity of the stomach has been found not larger than
would suffice to contain a hen's egg, but such extreme {614}
contraction is very rare.When the stomach in this disease is found
dilated, either the thickening involves only or chiefly the walls of
the pyloric portion, or the morbid process probably began there and was
followed by dilatation.In typical cases the walls of the entire stomach are thickened, but
frequently the thickening is most marked in the pyloric region.The
walls may measure an inch and even more in thickness.The thickened
walls are dense and firm, so that often upon incision the stomach does
not collapse.Upon transverse section the different coats of the stomach can be
distinguished.The mucous membrane is least affected, being sometimes
thickened, sometimes normal or atrophied.The muscularis mucosae is
hypertrophied, and is evident to the naked eye as a grayish band.The
submucous coat is of all the layers the most thickened, being sometimes
ten to fifteen times thicker than normal.It appears as a dense white
mass of fibrous tissue.The main muscular coat is also, as a rule,
greatly hypertrophied; the grayish, translucent muscular tissue is
pervaded with streaks of white fibrous tissue prolonged from the
submucous and subserous coats.This last coat resembles in appearance
the submucous coat, which, however, it does not equal in thickness,
although it is, proportionately to its normal thickness, much
hypertrophied.The free peritoneal surface usually appears opaque and
dense.To the naked eye it is apparent that the new growth of fibrous tissue
is most extensive in the submucous coat, which it is probably correct
to regard as the starting-point of the disease.The hypertrophy of the
muscular layers is also in most cases an important element in the
increased thickness of the gastric walls.Microscopical examination[9] shows sometimes a nearly normal mucous
membrane.The tubules, however, are usually more or less atrophied.In
the case reported by Nothnagel tubules could be found only in the
pyloric region of the stomach.The essential lesion is the new growth
of fibrillated connective tissue pervading all of the coats of the
stomach.In an interesting case reported by Marcy and Griffith,[10]
which was believed to be caused by an extensive cicatrized ulcer, a new
formation of smooth muscular tissue was found not only in the main
muscular tunic and the muscularis mucosae, but also throughout the
submucosa.This peculiarity was probably referable to the cicatrization
of the ulcer.[Footnote 9: Microscopical examination is always necessary for a
positive diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach.In a case which I
examined post-mortem of double ovarian cancer, with multiple secondary
deposits in the peritoneum and with chronic peritonitis, the stomach
presented the typical gross appearances of cirrhosis, but here and
there were to be found nests of cancer-cells in the prevailing new
growth of fibrous tissue in the walls of the stomach.]Sci._, July, 1884, p.Not infrequently adhesions exist between the stomach and surrounding
organs.Exceptionally, a diffuse growth of fibrous tissue may invade
the greater part of the peritoneum, particularly the visceral layer,
and cause a thickening similar to that existing in the stomach.In such
cases ascites is usually a marked symptom.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of cirrhosis of the stomach is grave.The
disease runs a chronic course, and usually terminates in death by
asthenia.There is no reason to believe that the stomach can ever be
restored to its {615} normal condition.Still, cases have been reported
in which it has been supposed that cirrhosis of the stomach has
terminated in recovery.[11] The diagnosis, however, in such cases must
remain doubtful.[Footnote 11: Lesser, _Cirrhosis Ventriculi_, Inaug.Diss., Berlin,
1876; Smith, "Cirrhosis of the Stomach," _Edinb.TREATMENT.--The treatment is symptomatic, and is to be guided by the
general principles developed in previous articles concerning the
regulation of the diet and the administration of remedies.HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS.The various causes of stenosis of the pylorus have already been
mentioned under DILATATION OF THE STOMACH, and the most important of
these causes have received full consideration in connection with ULCER
and with CANCER OF THE STOMACH.Only one of the varieties of pyloric stenosis can claim consideration
as an independent disease.This variety is the so-called hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus (Lebert) or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
(Habershon[12]).Under the name of hypertrophic stenosis have been
described cases in which the stenosis was due to hypertrophy of only
one of the coats of the stomach, usually either the submucous or the
muscular coat, sometimes only the mucous coat.In most cases, however,
all of the coats of the stomach are involved, and the lesion is similar
to that of cirrhosis of the stomach, but it is confined to the pylorus
or to the pyloric region.In such cases there is new growth of fibrous
tissue, most marked in the submucous coat, and hypertrophy of the
muscular coat.The appearance of the pylorus in some instances of
hypertrophic stenosis has been not inappropriately compared to that of
the cervix uteri.[Footnote 12: Habershon, _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, London, 1862;
Lebert, _Die Krankh.d. Magens_, Tubingen, 1878; Nauwerk, _Deutsches
Arch.In the majority of cases the change here described is the result of
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and some believe that all cases of
so-called hypertrophic stenosis or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
are referable to ulcer, although it may be very difficult to discover
the cicatrix of the ulcer.It is certainly not always possible to
detect either ulcer or cicatrix, so that it seems proper to regard the
hypertrophic stenosis in such cases as constituting an independent
affection.The symptoms are those of dilatation of the stomach, sometimes preceded
by evidences of chronic catarrhal gastritis.The thickened pylorus can
sometimes be felt during life as a small, cylindrical, usually movable
tumor, either stationary in progress or of very slow growth.In most cases the diagnosis of organic stenosis of the pylorus can be
made.Cancer may sometimes be excluded by the long duration of the
symptoms and the stationary character of the tumor if a tumor can be
felt.The exclusion of ulcer is more difficult and hardly possible, for
ulcer may have existed without producing characteristic symptoms.The prognosis and treatment have been considered under DILATATION OF
THE STOMACH.{616} ATROPHY OF THE STOMACH.Atrophy of the stomach may be the result of stenosis of the cardia or
of the oesophagus.The stomach may participate with other organs in the
general atrophy attending inanition and marasmus.The walls of a
dilated stomach may be very thin.Especial importance has been attached in recent years to degeneration
and atrophy of the gastric tubules.The glands of the stomach may
undergo degeneration and atrophy in various diseases of the stomach,
such as chronic catarrhal gastritis, phlegmonous gastritis, cirrhosis
of the stomach, and cancer of the stomach.Parenchymatous and fatty
degeneration of the glandular cells of the stomach occurs in acute
infectious diseases, as typhoid fever and yellow fever, also as a
result of poisoning with phosphorus, arsenic, and the mineral acids.It is claimed by Fenwick that atrophy of the stomach may occur not only
as a secondary change, but also as a primary disease attended by grave
symptoms.Fenwick has described a number of cases in which the gastric
tubules were atrophied without thickening of the walls of the stomach
and without diminution in the size of the cavity of the stomach--cases,
therefore, which cannot be classified with cirrhosis of the
stomach.[13] He attributes in many cases the atrophy of the tubules to
an increase in the connective tissue of the mucous membrane, and draws
a comparison between atrophy of the stomach and the atrophic form of
chronic Bright's disease.[Footnote 13: _The Lancet_, 1877, July 7 _et seq._]

In 1860, Flint[14] called attention to the relation between anaemia and
atrophy of the gastric glands.He expressed the opinion that some cases
of obscure and profound anaemia are dependent upon degeneration and
atrophy of the glands of the stomach.Since Flint's publication cases
have been reported by Fenwick, Quincke, Brabazon, and Nothnagel, in
which lesions supposed to be due to pernicious anaemia have been found
after death associated with atrophy of the gastric tubules.[15]
Nothnagel's case, which has already been mentioned, was one of
cirrhosis of the stomach.[Footnote 14: A. Flint, _American Medical Times_, 1860.Further
contributions of Flint to this subject are to be found in the _New York
Medical Journal_, March, 1871, and in his _Treatise on the Principles
and Practice of Medicine_, p.[Footnote 15: Fenwick, _loc.cit._; Quincke, _Volkmann's Samml.100 (case _b_); Brabazon, _British Med.Journ._, 1878,
July 27 (without microscopical examination!); Nothnagel, _Deutsches
Arch.The symptoms which have been referred to primary atrophy of the stomach
are severe anaemia and disturbances of digestion, such as anorexia,
eructations, and vomiting.The digestive disturbances are often not
greater than are frequently observed in cases of severe anaemia.In my opinion, the existence of atrophy of the stomach as a primary and
independent disease has not been established.In many cases which have
been described as primary atrophy the histological investigation of the
stomach has been very defective.Degeneration and atrophy of the
gastric tubules secondary to various diseases of the stomach and to
certain general diseases is an important lesion when it is extensive,
and must seriously impair the digestion, and consequently the
nutrition, of the patient.{617} ANOMALIES IN THE FORM AND IN THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH.These anomalies, so far as they have not received consideration in
previous articles, are of more anatomical than clinical interest, and
therefore here require only brief mention.The stomach may have an hour-glass shape in consequence of a
constriction separating the cardiac from the pyloric half of the organ.This constriction is sometimes congenital,[16] sometimes caused by
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and sometimes caused by spasmodic
contraction of the muscle, which may persist after death, but
disappears when the stomach is artificially distended.Hour-glass shape
of the stomach has been diagnosed during life by administering an
effervescing powder according to Frerichs' method.[Footnote 16: A careful study of the congenital form of hour-glass
contraction of the stomach has been made by W. R. Williams ("Ten Cases
of Congenital Contraction of the Stomach," _Journ.and
Physiology_, 1882-83, p.Foreign substances of hard consistence which have been swallowed
sometimes cause diverticula of the stomach.Sometimes the fundus of the stomach is but little developed, so that
the organ is long and narrow like a piece of intestine.The stomach may be variously distorted by external pressure, as from
tumors and by adhesions.The loop-shaped stomach and vertical position of the stomach have been
already considered in connection with DILATATION OF THE STOMACH (page
602).In transposition of the viscera the stomach is also transposed.In such
a case difficulties may arise in the diagnosis of pyloric cancer, as in
a case described by Legroux.The stomach may be found in hernial sacs.Mention has already been made
of the presence of dilated stomachs in scrotal hernia.More frequently
the stomach is found in umbilical hernias.In diaphragmatic hernia the
stomach is found more frequently in the thorax than is any other
abdominal viscus.In 266 diaphragmatic hernias collected by Lascher[17]
the stomach was found either wholly or partly in the thorax in 161
cases.The clinical consideration of diaphragmatic hernia, however,
does not belong here.[Footnote 17: _Deutsches Arch.Furthermore, the stomach may be displaced by tumors, enlargement of
neighboring organs, tight-lacing, adhesions, and the weight of hernias.These displacements, however, are generally inconsiderable and of
little importance.In a case described by Mazotti[18] the stomach, of which the pyloric
portion was fixed by adhesions, was twisted around its long axis.[Footnote 18: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1874, ii.{618} RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.Sufficient attention has already been given to perforation of the
stomach in consequence of diseases of its walls, such as ulcer, cancer,
abscesses, and toxic gastritis.A healthy stomach may be ruptured by violent injury to the abdomen even
when no external wound is produced.An example of rupture of the
stomach from this cause is that sometimes produced when a person has
been run over by a heavy vehicle.It has been claimed that a stomach with healthy walls may burst in
consequence of over-distension of the organ with solids or with gas.The older literature is especially rich in reports of so-called
spontaneous rupture of the stomach.Most of these cases were examples
of perforation of gastric ulcer.In a case of apparently spontaneous
rupture of a stomach which had become abnormally distended with gas,
Chiari[19] found that the rupture was through the cicatrix of a simple
ulcer in the lesser curvature.It is hardly conceivable that rupture of
the healthy stomach from over-distension can occur so long as the
orifices of the organ are unobstructed.Lautschner[20] reports a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in
a woman seventy years old with an enormous umbilical hernia which
contained the pyloric portion of the stomach.After drinking eight
glasses of water and two cups of tea and eating meat, she was seized
with vomiting, during which the stomach burst with a report which was
audible to the patient and to those around her.She passed into a state
of collapse and died in thirteen hours.A rent several centimeters long
was found in the posterior wall of the stomach.Lautschner thinks that
the pylorus was bent in the hernial sac so as to be obstructed.In the
walls of the stomach he found no evidence of pre-existing disease.[Footnote 20: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1881, ii.]There is no satisfactory proof of the possibility of the occurrence of
rupture of a stomach with healthy walls except as a result of external
violence.The symptoms and treatment of rupture of the stomach are those of
perforation of the stomach, and have already been described.That the subject of gastromalacia should still occupy so much space in
medical works the purpose of which is mainly clinical proves that many
physicians still cling to the belief that this process may occur during
life.It is, nevertheless, certain that the condition which, according
to the ordinary and traditional use of the term, is designated
gastromalacia, is always a post-mortem process and is without the
slightest clinical significance.So long as the circulation of the
blood in the walls of the stomach is undisturbed, self-digestion of
this organ cannot occur.No one doubts {619} that parts of the gastric
walls in which the circulation has been arrested, and which are exposed
to the gastric juice, undergo self-digestion, as has already been set
forth in the article on GASTRIC ULCER.To describe cases of this nature
under the name of gastromalacia, however, is misleading, and can cause
only confusion, for the long-continued discussion as to whether
gastromalacia is a vital or a cadaveric process applied certainly to a
different conception of the term.In some of the cases which have been
published, even in recent years, in support of the vitalistic theory of
gastromalacia, and in which it has been proven that perforation of the
stomach occurred during life, the solution of continuity took place
through parts of the gastric walls in which the circulation had already
been obstructed, particularly by extensive hemorrhagic infiltration.Some of these cases are probably also examples of perforation of
gastric ulcer or of rupture of cicatrices from over-distension of the
stomach, in which post-mortem digestion of the edges of the ulcer or of
the cicatrix obscured the real nature of the process.The subject of
gastromalacia should be relegated wholly to works on physiology and on
pathological anatomy.{620}

INTESTINAL INDIGESTION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.NATURE.--The term indigestion in its most common meaning refers to
gastric indigestion only.This limitation has arisen from the fact that
gastric digestion has been more thoroughly understood than intestinal
digestion, and because the symptoms, flatulence, acidity, eructations
of gas, pyrosis, and vomiting of unaltered food, are readily referred
to the stomach as their source.Intestinal digestion has not been well
known until within a recent date, and its phenomena in disease have
been mistaken for other pathological conditions.From the important and complex function of the intestinal juices, and
the very great share they take in the solution of food, there must be
many phases of departure from the normal state.The processes of
intestinal digestion are more intricate than those of gastric
digestion, of a higher grade, and the chemical reactions are more
numerous, depending upon the participation of the bile, the pancreatic
juice, and the succus entericus; while intestinal absorption is a more
complex act than that of gastric absorption.A brief review of the physiology of intestinal digestion will be of aid
in making clear its pathology.The object of all digestion is to make such a solution of the ingesta
that they may pass through animal membrane and so enter the system.Mechanical disintegration and simple solution do something toward this,
but for substances insoluble in water a more thorough change is brought
about by ferments which convert insoluble into soluble compounds.Mastication breaks up the
masses of food; the saliva softens them, dissolves soluble substances,
as salt and sugar, and thus the pleasures of the palate are enhanced.The ferment ptyalin acts upon starch (boiled starch being more rapidly
altered than unboiled), and changes it to dextrin and grape-sugar, both
of which are diffusible through animal membrane, entering lymph-spaces
and blood-vessels.The greater part of the saliva secreted is swallowed
with the food or in the intervals of eating.The amount formed in
twenty-four hours varies from 1500 gm.(Bidder and Schmidt) to 700 gm.It must therefore serve some ulterior purpose in the stomach.Ewald[1] says that saliva converts starch into sugar in acid as well as
in alkaline and neutral solutions.But Langley[2] asserts that the
ferment of {621} saliva is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid of the
gastric juice.The longer food is subjected to mastication and
insalivation, the more thorough is the mouth digestion and the better
prepared is the mass for the action of the gastric and intestinal
juices.It is asserted that fatty matters are emulsified to a certain
extent by the alkaline ferments of the saliva.[Footnote 1: _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.[Footnote 2: "On the Destruction of Ferments in the Alimentary Canal,"
_Journal of Physiology_, London, Jan., 1882, p.When the food enters the stomach the nitrogenous (albuminoid) elements
are attacked by the gastric juice, the bundles of muscular fibre are
broken up, the fibrillae are reduced to a granular mass, but not
completely dissolved (Frerichs), the fat-globules are freed from their
envelopes of connective tissue, milk is coagulated, and the casein is
dissolved."The tangible, practical object of this change is to form out of a
little-diffusible body (albumen) one easily diffusible (peptone), which
is capable of absorption through animal membrane in a higher degree
than ordinary albumen" (Ewald).Peptone is formed out of ordinary
albumen, as grape-sugar is formed out of starch, by taking up water; it
is therefore the hydrate of albumen.The more tardy the digestion in the stomach the more highly charged
with acid is the gastric juice.According to Wright, the degree of
alkalinity of the saliva is in proportion to the acidity of the stomach
fluids, and Bence Jones has observed that during the excretion of acid
in the stomach the total alkalinity of all alkaline digestive fluids is
increased.The lesson is thus learned that a too careful preparation of
food, so as to shorten and lessen gastric labor, diminishes the
activity of the gastric juice as well as that of all other digestive
fluids.Intestinal digestion begins when the softened mass passes through the
pylorus.This mass (chyme) is composed of (1) the products of gastric
digestion which have not been absorbed--peptone, dextrose, levulose,
peptonized gelatin, with mucus and gastric juice; (2) all matters which
have escaped digestion--the starch of vegetable substances, dissolved
gelatin and albumen which have not been peptonized, and some unaltered
muscle-structure; and (3) fat, fatty acids, and cellulose upon which
neither saliva nor gastric juice has had any influence (Ewald).This complex semi-fluid mass with an acid reaction enters the duodenum
and comes in contact with fluids and ferments destined to work
remarkable changes in its composition.The first of these fluids is the
bile, which is alkaline and composed of the glycocholate and
taurocholate of sodium, cholesterin, soaps, etc., phosphates and
carbonates of lime and sodium, chlorides of potassium and sodium,
bile-pigment, etc.The outflow of bile is excited by the contact of the
chyme with the orifice of the bile-duct.When the alkaline bile is
mingled with the acid mass in the duodenum, it neutralizes its acidity,
precipitates the peptones, and therefore stops all further action of
the gastric juice.Fats containing free fatty acids are emulsified,
soaps being formed by a combination of the alkalies of the bile with
the fatty acids.Lastly, bile hinders fermentation in the intestine and
acts as a purgative by exciting peristalsis.Absorption is probably
also favored by bile, as it has been found that emulsified fats pass
more readily through an animal membrane which has been wet with
bile.[3]

[Footnote 3: Ewald thinks this result is doubtful: in animals killed
during digestion he has found an acid reaction in the contents of the
intestine beyond the opening of the bile-duct, with no precipitation of
the albumen (_op.{622} As far as we now know, the function of the bile is to neutralize
the acidity of the duodenal contents, and thus pave the way for the
action of a digesting fluid of much greater potency and of much higher
function.[4]

[Footnote 4: In order still further to demonstrate the necessity of
bile-action as a preparation for pancreatic digestion, it may be
mentioned that in artificial experiments, with a heat equal to that of
the body, if antiseptics analogous to gastric juice and bile are not
used, there is a too rapid change from alkalinity to acidity, and
consequently all of the starch is not converted into sugar before it
develops lactic acid with putrefactive disorganization.A deficiency of
bile, therefore, is a cause of intestinal indigestion (Bartlett, _op.This fluid, the pancreatic juice, is composed of inorganic salts,
albuminoids, and certain specific ferments, and has an alkaline
reaction.It has a threefold operation upon the softened mass with
which it now comes in contact: 1.The starch of vegetable matter, which
has been only slightly acted on up to this time, is now rapidly
converted into grape-sugar by a peculiar diastatic ferment more active
than any other known ferment.Albuminous matters (proteids) which
have escaped digestion in the stomach are changed into a soluble and
absorbable pancreas--peptone.Trypsin is the active ferment in this
case (Kuhne), and it is only in alkaline or neutral solutions that the
albuminoids are readily dissolved.The necessity of neutralization by
the alkaline bile is thus demonstrated.A ferment distinct from the
others splits the fats into fatty acids and glycerin, and emulsifies
them so that they can be taken up by the lacteals lower down.Experiments made by mixing albuminates with pancreatic gland-extract,
under favorable conditions, show after a certain time the presence of
leucin, tyrosin, hypoxanthin, and asparaginic acid.In a feebly
alkaline or neutral solution a faint putrefactive odor is soon noticed,
with the development of bacteria; ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid--evidences of the putrefaction of
albumen--are also detected.It is difficult to tell when normal digestion in the intestines ends
and putrefaction begins.The conclusion is, that the normal action of
pancreatic juice (trypsin) gives origin to bodies met with in the
ordinary putrefaction of albumen.[5] This thin border-line between
normal intestinal digestion and the decomposition of the intestinal
contents has an important bearing on the facts of intestinal
indigestion.[Footnote 5: Ewald, _op.The intestinal juice performs a minor but independent part in
digestion.It converts albuminous matter into peptone, and hydrated
starch into sugar.Its function is therefore supplementary to that of
the gastric and pancreatic secretions.[6]

[Footnote 6: Ewald, _op.103; also, "The Functions of the
Intestinal Juice," Charles L. Dana, _Med.News_, Philada., July 15,
1882, p.When food enters the mouth the process of digestion begins, and all the
activities of the glands concerned in digestion are probably at once
set in motion.Mastication excites, by reflex action, pancreatic
secretion; the acid chyme touches the orifice of the common bile-duct
and stimulates the outflow of bile; the neutralized chyme next invites
pancreatic digestion.For the integrity of intestinal digestion it is
required that mastication and stomach digestion should be normally
performed.The intestinal movements which are so necessary to digestion by making
successive changes in the position of the intestinal contents are {623}
controlled by nervous arrangements, but may occur independently of the
central nervous system.The ganglia of Auerbach and of Meissner in the
intestinal wall are sufficient for the development of peristaltic
waves.The irritation of the mucous membrane by food, hyperaemia, and
the pouring out of digestive juices, and intestinal movements, are
parts of one process.Paralysis by section of the splanchnic leads to
hyperaemia of the intestinal vessels and increased peristalsis;
stimulation of the splanchnic causes anaemia of the intestinal wall and
arrest of movement.Local cold by producing anaemia brings about the
same result.The products of digestion as they pass toward the jejunum consist of
diffusible peptones, sugar, emulsified fats and oils, and substances
which have escaped digestion, as fragments of muscular fibre,
starch-corpuscles, connective tissue, hairs, or other foreign matters.The bowel contains also carbonic acid, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and marsh gas.The mass, alkaline or neutral in the duodenum
and jejunum, becomes acid in the ileum from the putrefaction of albumen
and fermentation.The peptones and sugar pass by osmosis into the
blood-vessels of the portal system and thence to the liver.In the
liver the sugar is converted into glycogen (carbohydrate), and stored
in the liver-cells until needed for the maintenance of animal heat and
for the nutrition of the tissues.The peptones are used in part to
supply the nitrogenous waste of tissue, but much of the albuminoid
matter is broken up in the liver into glycogen and urea, the latter of
which is excreted by the kidneys as waste matter.The minute granules of oil in emulsion are taken up by the epithelial
cells covering the villi; thence they enter the adenoid tissue of the
villi on their way to the lymphatic radicles, the lacteals.From here
the passage is open to the underlying lymphatic vessels and to the
larger abdominal lymph-vessels and the thoracic duct beyond.Intestinal digestion is not completed and the body does not receive its
pabulum until the products of digestion have reached the liver and the
thoracic duct.ETIOLOGY.--It is usually said that intestinal dyspepsia is more common
in women than in men, but the contrary is the rule.Some of its most
common causes--over-eating and the eating of indigestible food--are
especially vices of men.It is more frequent between the ages of forty and fifty, but no age is
exempt.Infants at the breast, children of any age, adults, and old men
and women are alike subject to it.Men in middle life begin to suffer
from the imprudence and carelessness of youth and from the anxiety and
cares of business.The indulged children of rich parents and improperly
bottle-fed infants frequently suffer.Heredity and idiosyncrasy have a certain influence in determining the
prevalence of intestinal dyspepsia.The distaste for and inability to
digest vegetables, fruits, and fats are often peculiarities of family
history.The occurrence of cases in the same family is often explained
by improper food, bad cooking, and irregular hours, to the evil
influences of which all the members are similarly subjected.All conditions of the organism which result in a depraved or altered
blood-supply, as anaemia, primary and secondary rachitis, chronic
syphilis, and continued febrile diseases, are causes of intestinal
indigestion.{624} The connection of the indigestion of fats with the
strumous diathesis and with phthisis is undisputed.J. Hughes Bennett
traced the origin of phthisis to defective fat-digestion; strumous
indigestion and the indigestion of fat are synonymous terms.Debilitating influences, such as bad air, want of cleanliness and
outdoor exercise, impair functional activity in the intestines as
elsewhere.Sexual excesses, but especially masturbation, have a special
influence for evil in this direction.The influence of the mind upon the digestion of starch and fats is even
greater than upon gastric digestion, for no other reason perhaps than
that the former is a more complex function and less easily relieved
than the latter.Prolonged or excessive mental labor does not do so
much harm as mental worry, over-anxiety, and the strain and overwork of
business.Professional men--lawyers, physicians, and clergymen--who
become over-burdened with responsibilities, and who sympathize too much
with the distresses of others, are very prone to suffer.The careworn
face with lines about the mouth and forehead is one of the plainest
signs of duodenal defect.The proper secretion of the juices of the
intestine and normal peristalsis are impossible where brain and nerves
get no rest.The too rapid mental development of the children of the
present day is a fruitful source of weakened fat-and-starch digestion
and of impaired development.So long as children are sent to the public
school at four and six years of age, there will continue to grow up a
precocious race with active brains in feeble bodies.[7] This injurious
result is largely brought about by the direct interference of premature
brain-development with the complex intestinal processes of digestion
and absorption.[Footnote 7: In eight of the States and Territories the minimum age for
entering the public school is fixed at four years; in seventeen States
at five years; in the others, except two, at six years.The two notable
exceptions are Alabama and New Mexico, where children do not enter
school until the age of seven.]Wealth, with ease and inactivity, and sedentary occupations, contribute
to the same end by lessening the need of food, and thus debilitating
the organs of digestion by inaction.Sedentary pursuits, especially
those in which the body is bent forward and constricted or compressed
at the waist, interfere with active function in the intestine.This is
the case in tailors, shoemakers, etc.Tight-lacing in women and a too
tight trouser-band in men are injurious.Hot climates, especially when combined with dampness, lead to disorder
in the intestine and liver.This effect is most marked among persons
coming from colder climates, as among the English in India, who keep up
the habits of eating to which they have been accustomed at home.The
lessened demand destroys the appetite, and stimulants and condiments
are resorted to to whip up the inactive functions.The intestine is
loaded with a mass of crude, unaltered matter which can with difficulty
be disposed of.Chronic indigestion results, varied with acute attacks
of diarrhoea or dysentery.The portal system is filled with an excess
of albuminoid material which the liver is unable to store away.The
excess is got rid of by conversion into uric acid.Lithaemia and
chronic congestion and enlargement of the overloaded liver result, with
their many attendant evils.Over-eating occasions first gastric and then intestinal indigestion by
the {625} entrance of unaltered food into the duodenum.Eating without
hunger often involves the taking of food which the body does not need
and which the stomach cannot digest.Diners-out rarely go through a
season without one or more internal revolts.A too-varied diet, a
dinner of many dishes, is faulty in variety as well as in excess.On
the other hand, a too great sameness in diet and the prolonged use of
one or two articles of food which are not easy of digestion, and which
have a great deal of waste, fatigue and then disorder intestinal
digestion.This is a fault into which children are often allowed to
fall.Indigestible food and an excess of starchy or fatty food conduce to
disorder of duodenal digestion.In conditions of debility and anaemia
and in the convalescence of fevers the deficiency of saliva involves an
inability to digest starch in the mouth and points to a corresponding
want in the duodenal secretions.The improper use of alcoholic liquors,
taking them on an empty stomach between meals and in excess, tends to
direct irritation of the mucous tract.Condiments in large quantity
have the same effect.Irregularity in the hours of eating and a faulty distribution of the
amount of food disturb the perfect working of the mechanism of
digestion.Very light breakfasts and very late and large dinners are
injurious.The habit, now quite general in cities, of deferring the
breakfast proper until midday, leaves the system too long--fifteen to
sixteen hours--without proper food and weakens digestive activity.Intestinal indigestion is very common among Americans who have lived
abroad and adopted European customs.Another cause which is unfortunately very common is the imperfect
mastication and insalivation of food, due to too great haste in eating,
to defects in the teeth or gums, or to a deficiency of saliva.The
saliva no doubt sometimes possesses a feeble diastatic power, although
abundant in amount.Carnivorous animals bolt their food, but
vegetable-eaters must masticate.Slow mastication transforms starch
into sugar, and at the same time excites secretive activity in the
glands of the digestive tract, especially in the pancreas.The more
thoroughly this preliminary function is performed the better
preparation is there for the subsequent acts of digestion.[8]

[Footnote 8: "The familiar act of chewing is seldom a subject of
reflection, yet it throws into motion a more complicated system of
levers, accompanied by a drain of fluids from more curiously adapted
apparatus, than the arts can parallel" (Leared, _On Indigestion_,
London, 1863, p.The chewing of tobacco, a wretched habit which is much less common now
than formerly, and to a less extent the habit of smoking, are causes of
deficient, altered, or depraved saliva, and secondarily of altered
pancreatic secretion.The thin smoker grows fat when he abandons the
weed.The normal functions of the intestines are interfered with and
indigestion is set up by constipation.Every one has felt the activity
in digestion which accompanies the regular habit of defecation, and the
torpor and oppression which depend upon an unemptied colon."There is a
concert of action in virtue of which the whole muscular apparatus of
the digestive tube sympathizes with that of the large intestine.This
concert of action, which induces pathological states, is the reason why
in the {626} physiological state a regular contraction of the whole
intestinal tube, including the stomach, is the consequence of the
regular contraction of the large intestine."[9]

[Footnote 9: Trousseau, "Les Dyspepsies," _L'Union medicale_, tome xi.,
1857, p.An excess of acid in the stomach would enfeeble the solvent power of
the intestinal fluids by antagonizing neutralization by the alkaline
bile; the same effect follows any cause which prevents the outflow of
the bile, as the plugging of the common bile-duct by mucus and
epithelium in catarrh or by an impacted gall-stone.The emulsification
of fats is incomplete and decomposition in the intestine follows.The
antagonism of the saliva and the gastric juice, of the gastric juice
(or the chyme) and the bile, must preserve their delicate and nice
adjustment in order for digestion to be properly performed.Diseases of the pancreas seriously embarrass digestion in the
intestine.Lesions of this organ, as catarrh of the duct, cancer, fatty
degeneration, etc., may result in impaired emulsification of fats,
fatty diarrhoea, and wasting.Intestinal indigestion accompanies hyperaemia and catarrh of the
intestinal mucous membrane, diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver,
and all other causes which impede portal circulation.SYMPTOMS.--Intestinal indigestion cannot be so clearly pictured as that
of gastric dyspepsia.This is owing to the frequent concurrence of the
two conditions, the gastric symptoms taking precedence of the others.The more complex nature of the intestinal function is another reason,
intestinal indigestion having more modifications in its phenomena.In
the stomach there is only one active secretion; in the intestine there
are three, all participants in the act of solution.An alteration in
the quality or quantity of one of these--the bile, for example--would
lead to different symptomatic results than would follow another
defective secretion, as that of the pancreas, for instance.Clinical
study has not yet fully differentiated the forms of indigestion due to
these several deficiencies.But there are certain well-defined symptoms
associated with intestinal disorders which are distinguished by their
seat, time of their appearance, and their character from analogous
symptoms connected with the stomach.Intestinal indigestion may be acute or chronic.The latter is the more
typical and more common form.When a sudden attack of indigestion in the intestine results from the
entrance into the duodenum of food in such a state that it cannot be
digested, the result is the rapid development of pain, flatulence,
borborygmi, and frequently of fever, ending in diarrhoea, with the
escape perhaps of the offending matter: a condition then exists which
may be called acute or subacute intestinal catarrh or acute intestinal
indigestion.One name would be as correct as the other.Slight acute
forms are marked by a coated tongue, loss of appetite, headache, pains
in the limbs, distress in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium,
flatulence, and constipation.These might be accompanied by symptoms
indicating a disorder of the liver functions--light- stools,
slight jaundice, lithates in the urine.But intestinal indigestion
alone can cause these symptoms without the condition of so-called
biliousness being present.The local symptoms are due to the presence
in the intestine of an {627} imperfectly-altered mass and the
development of gas; some of the general symptoms are reflex; others, as
headache and lassitude and pain in the limbs, come from the absorption
into the blood of the gases, particularly sulphuretted hydrogen.The
participation of the stomach in acute attacks of this sort modifies the
symptoms as here described.Such attacks are apt to recur at intervals.If the causes which bring about acute disorder in the intestine are
allowed to continue, the intervals between the acute or subacute
attacks diminish, and there is in time a fixed state of chronic
intestinal dyspepsia in which the partly-altered food coming from the
stomach is not properly prepared for absorption.Instead of digestion
there is decomposition; the transition is easy from the one to the
other of these states.The symptoms connected in this case with the
digestive organs are pain, occurring from two to six hours after
eating, in the right hypochondrium, the epigastrium, or the umbilical
region, due to distension of the intestine with gas.This pain is dull,
not always fixed, lasts from one to three hours, and is accompanied by
tenderness on pressure over its seat.Tympanites, borborygmi, and a sensation of fulness in the abdomen
accompany the pain or may exist without it.Gaseous accumulations in
the intestine, the cause of these symptoms, have an independent source,
being produced by decomposition in the gut itself, and are not due to
the descent of gases from the stomach through the pylorus.What is a
physiological and temporary condition becomes in disease a distressing
symptom of long duration.In intestinal indigestion the gut is nearly
always inflated with gas, which in its movement produces rumbling
noises.In acute indigestion it is rapidly formed in large amount, and
by the stretching of the wall of the bowel and pressure on
nerve-filaments causes intense pain--colic.In the chronic form the
distension excites uneasy sensations, prevents sleep, and may be so
great as to cause dyspnoea by pushing the diaphragm upward.When the
small intestine is distended the greatest swelling may be about the
umbilicus, or the abdomen may be evenly rounded.When the colon is
chiefly or solely inflated, its outline across the upper part or at the
sides of the abdomen can be easily made out.It is produced by a loss of
contractility of the intestinal wall.The more direct causes are
over-distension of the gut and disturbance in the circulation and
innervation of its walls.The stools are hard and dry, and are expelled
with difficulty.Sometimes they are coated with shreds or films of
mucus, the product of a chronic catarrh of the mucous membrane of the
colon, or mucus from the small intestine is intimately mixed with the
mass.Diarrhoea may alternate with constipation.The passage of
unaltered food, as fragments of meat, vegetables, or fruit, clearly
shows the extent to which indigestion exists.By the microscope
particles of food which have escaped complete disintegration may be
detected.Very dark-green or black discharges
show an excess of bile; light-yellow or gray slate-, a
deficiency.Stools of the latter character are highly offensive in
odor.Hemorrhoids are often present, being due to the sluggish portal
circulation and to the pressure of hard fecal masses in the rectum.The
appetite is not impaired, as a rule, but it may be fitful or irregular.A bad {628} taste in the mouth, and a swollen, relaxed, and coated
tongue may exist without any decided gastric disease.The symptoms of disorder of the nervous system are more marked than in
gastric dyspepsia.This results not so much from the depressing
influences of pain as from the peculiar malnutrition of the
nerve-tissue.In order to have furnished to the blood the pabulum out
of which the nerve-elements are reconstructed the digestion of fat must
be normally performed.Lecithin, which is found conspicuously in the
brain and nerves, is a complex fat containing phosphorus and
nitrogen.[10] Anaemia and waste follow directly from interference with
the digestion and absorption of fats and starch in the intestine, but
the most delicate, the most easily-disorganized solid of the body, the
nerve-tissue, is the first to feel and to manifest its want of natural
supply.And so the dyspeptic whose intestine is at fault becomes
depressed in spirits, hypochondriacal, absorbed in the contemplation of
his sufferings, analyzing them and referring them to the most serious
organic changes.There are sleeplessness, disturbing dreams, the habit
of waking at a fixed hour, dizziness, uneasy sensations or pain in the
head, and disturbances of the special senses, as buzzing in the ears,
muscae volitantes, and attacks of blindness.Headache assumes often the
form of hemicrania; it may be in the forehead or about the eyes.Attacks of vertigo and sensations as if the ground were rising beneath
the feet accompany intestinal flatulence.Confusion of thought, loss of
the power of application, and mental inertia are frequent sources of
anxiety.Paralysis has been noted as following indigestion.Epileptiform convulsions and milder epileptic attacks can be traced to
undigested matter in the intestine.[11] Various modifications of
general sensibility also happen: there are pains in the back and limbs,
hyperaesthesia, and anaesthesia.An inaptitude for exertion, especially
for mental labor, forces the boy to give up school and college life.Successful careers are abandoned by men who at the cost of neglecting
all the rules of health have succeeded for a brief period in passing
their fellows in the race.Sudden attacks of fainting have been noted,
with very grave collapse.These are the effect upon the nervous centres
of the absorption of sulphuretted hydrogen which has been evolved in
large quantities in the intestine.[12] The daily occurrence of
vertiginous and other morbid sensations, with melancholia, may be due
to the daily toxic absorption of gas from the intestine.[Footnote 10: Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New York,
1881, p.[Footnote 11: Chambers, _The Indigestions_, London, 1867, pp.[Footnote 12: Tyrell, case of a man with eructations smelling of
sulphuretted hydrogen who had vertigo and sudden collapse; symptoms
relieved by purgative (_Pacific Med.Journ._, May, 1882, p.The action of the heart is disturbed as in stomach indigestion.Irritability of the heart and palpitation are in part due to anaemia
and in part to mechanical pressure and reflex influences.The nervous,
anaemic, thin dyspeptic has among his chief troubles a throbbing heart,
which keeps him awake at night and fixes his attention upon this organ
as the seat of his disease.The general circulation is languid; cold
hands and feet and cold sweats testify to this, and the irregularity or
suppression of catamenia follows upon the irregular blood-supply.The urine is usually high-, has an abnormally high density, is
acid, and on cooling deposits lithates, uric acid, and oxalate-of-lime
{629} crystals.The urine is most heavily loaded with sediment when
digestion has been recently completed.Therefore, the morning urine
after a heavy dinner of the night before contains the largest amount of
lithates.Albuminuria is occasionally a symptom of indigestion in the
bowel.The eating of cheese or pastry in excess may cause it.[13]
Seminal emissions at night frequently occur.The action and reaction
upon each other of this perversion of the sexual function, the
indigestion, and the mental disorder, reduce the poor sufferer to a
most pitiable condition of despondency and prostration.[14]

[Footnote 13: Warburton Begbie's _Works_, Sydenham Society's
Publications, 1882, p.[Footnote 14: The writer has observed cases in which an exaggeration of
the sexual instinct in men of middle age was associated with intestinal
indigestion.]Anaemia is one of the earliest indications of impaired nutrition.It
precedes loss of flesh and the wrinkled and dry condition of the skin
which may be a marked symptom in cases of long standing.Various
eruptions appear on the skin.In the strumous dyspepsia of children the
white, almost waxy, skin is covered with dry scales, which may be seen
over the whole body from head to foot.No symptom is more
characteristic of intestinal indigestion and of imperfect fat digestion
and absorption than this.Eczema and psoriasis, pityriasis, impetigo,
and porrigo decalvans are forms of skin eruption seen.Closely allied to the symptoms caused by indigestion in the intestine
are those due to functional disorder of the liver.The liver completes
the work which the intestine has begun.It receives directly from the
intestine blood laden with the products of digestion, and further
transforms them into substances to be used in the economy.The symptoms
which result from disturbances in the performance of these functions
are, as has been said, closely connected with the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion.This association is shown by the tendency among
older writers to trace all such symptoms to the liver, the terms
bilious and biliousness including all the phenomena of derangement of
the function of digestion in the intestine, as well of the function of
the liver.Later writers excluded the part of the liver to a great
extent in giving rise to the so-called bilious symptoms.Recent
physiological study has shown how closely the intestine and the liver
are associated in health and in disease.When the liver is implicated
in indigestion the symptoms which follow are due either to a deficiency
of the secretion of bile, and the resultant disturbance of digestion in
the intestine, or to a derangement in the transformation in the liver
of the products of albuminoid digestion.When the disorganization of
the peptones is imperfectly performed in the liver, instead of urea
there is a production of lithates and lithic acid, constituting the
condition called lithaemia.The lithates pass into the urine and are
deposited.The occurrence of this urinary sediment after excesses and
imprudences in diet is well known.The continuance of lithaemia leads
to the development of symptoms more or less characteristic.These are a
loss of appetite and coated tongue, flatulence, oppression after
eating, and constipation.The nervous system is soon disturbed, and
often to a marked extent.Vertigo, headache, disturbances of the
special senses, sleeplessness at night, drowsiness during the day,
annoy the patient and induce extreme hypochondria.He is worried,
moreover, with numbness and tingling in one or both arms or in the
{630} legs, and hence spring fears of paralysis.The heart is disturbed
in action, and is irregular and feeble.Emaciation in previously
corpulent persons is not unfrequent.COURSE, TERMINATION, AND SEQUELAE.--Acute dyspepsia in the bowel lasts
from a few hours to a day or two, and ends in leaving the patient as
well as before.A diarrhoea of indefinite duration may follow.Chronic intestinal indigestion in infants and young children often
continues until the diet is changed to one suited to the powers of
digestion.In adults interference with so important a function cannot
but have the most serious results.While the progress is slow, lasting
many years, there is a steady march from bad to worse.The character and conduct are so altered by the disease that a man may
be said to be just what his digestion makes him.Amiability under the
daily goad of intestinal dyspepsia is an impossibility.The
irreconcilables, the men out of joint with the world, are living
witnesses of the antagonism and disaffection within their intestines.The deterioration in health paves the way for many diseases, and there
is hardly an organ in the body which may not ultimately become the seat
of organic change.In the young, phthisis is frequently the ultimate result of the
malassimilation and malnutrition; in men beyond middle life
degenerative changes in the intestine, liver, and kidneys close the
series of morbid changes which began in the intestine.Thomas N.
Reynolds attributes bronchitis and phthisis in part to the local
influence of septic matter carried by the portal and lacteal vessels to
the lungs in cases of intestinal dyspepsia, with constipation and
septic fermentation of the ingesta.[15]

[Footnote 15: Paper read before section of Practical Medicine at
meeting of Am.In many cases business and professions are abandoned, and men become,
under the influence of despair and complete absorption in their
symptoms, intellectual and moral wrecks, burdens to themselves and to
all around them.In this stage the primary cause, the dyspepsia, is
lost in the exaggerated prominence of the nervous symptoms.DIAGNOSIS.--The acute variety is known by the seat of the abdominal
symptoms, the pain, distension, and movement of gas not being in the
stomach, but in the intestines.The pain is like colic; the abdomen is
sensitive to the touch; tympanites is general and may be very great.If
vomiting occurs, the symptoms continue after the stomach is empty.Diarrhoea may quickly come on, and is followed by relief.There is no sleep, but restlessness, and in children
delirium.In the chronic form the history of the case and the study of the causes
are of great value in formulating an opinion.The persistent abuse of
the pleasures of the table sooner or later develops intestinal
indigestion.Inquiry into the mode of life, hours of eating, manner of
eating, kinds of food taken, etc.The
teeth are defective, and mastication and insalivation are neglected.There is distress in the pit of the stomach or in the right
hypochondrium, beginning about two hours after eating and lasting from
four to six hours; intestinal distension with gas, either in the small
intestine or colon, with borborygmi and constipation, is generally
present.The nervous symptoms are characteristic: they are depression
of spirits, irritability, sleeplessness, vertigo, and {631} headache.The man is more completely altered mentally than in gastric dyspepsia.The urine contains lithates in excess; anaemia and emaciation progress
rapidly.Seminal emissions and weight and heaviness about the loins are
present.The following symptoms distinguish gastric dyspepsia, and do not occur
in intestinal indigestion unless the stomach is at the same time
involved: pain or weight in the epigastrium immediately after eating,
vomiting of unaltered food, of food in a state of acid fermentation,
eructations of ill-tasting or bad-smelling gas or of acid fluid,
water-brash, and heartburn.Loss of flesh may not take place to any
extent even in very bad forms.The diagnosis of differences in the forms of indigestion due to defects
in the pancreatic, biliary, or intestinal secretions is not at present
a matter of precise knowledge.A pancreatic indigestion would be
followed, it might be supposed invariably, by fatty stools; but such is
not the case, since degeneration of the pancreas and closure of the
duct have occurred without fatty evacuations from the bowels.[16]
Moreover, ulceration of the duodenum is followed sometimes by fat in
the stools.Still, if the symptoms of intestinal indigestion include
rapid wasting and fatty diarrhoea, we may conclude that the pancreas is
at fault.It may be seen as
oil-drops passed alone or with fecal matter, or as lumps of fat, pale
yellow and tallow-like.Glycosuria[17] bears some relation to
pancreatic diseases, and therefore may be an aid in diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Ewald, _op.95; D. S. Haldane, "Cancer of
Pancreas," _Edin.77; J. S.

Head of Pancreas," _ibid._, vol.[Footnote 17: Bright, "Cases and Observation connected with Diseases of
the Pancreas," _Med.-Chir.A deficient excretion of bile is indicated by a whitish or yellowish
coating of the tongue, with loss of appetite and bad taste in the
mouth.The stools are scanty, dry, slate- or white, and
offensive in smell.The patient is languid,
often irritable and hypochondriacal.He complains of headache, and is
dull and drowsy after eating.The heart's action is unsteady,
intermittent, or frequent.It is impossible to recognize indigestion
due solely to a deficiency of the intestinal juice or to feeble
peristalsis, granting that such forms exist.PROGNOSIS.--A fatal result does not follow directly from intestinal
indigestion.Its complications and results are frequently the causes of
death.Treated early and with decision, a cure can be expected.Everything depends upon the extent to which the patient submits to the
strict directions of his physician; his whole life must be made
subordinate to the plan of treatment.When the general health has become profoundly altered there is less
chance to do good.Discouraging symptoms are anaemia, debility,
coexisting gastric dyspepsia, an inherited hypochondriacal tendency, or
the strumous diathesis in children.When the disease has so far progressed that the patient is unable to
{632} rouse himself to the point of wishing to be well, only the most
severe measures directed to the control of an irresponsible person can
save him from ruin.In organic disease of the pancreas, intestine,
liver, or heart the result will depend upon the nature and curability
of the lesion.TREATMENT.--Acute intestinal indigestion due to the presence of
undigested food and gas in the intestine is treated by relieving
present distress and procuring a free movement from the bowels.A large
enema or a quick cathartic followed by an opiate--hypodermic injection
of morphia, paregoric, or other preparation--may give early relief.A
strict diet, warm poultices over the abdomen, and an anodyne may be
needed for several days after.The integrity of intestinal digestion depends upon the normal
performance of all the preceding stages of digestion.Perfect
insalivation, mastication, and gastric digestion are necessary to a
proper action of the intestinal juices.The first rule of treatment in
the chronic form is to examine into the condition of the mouth and
teeth--to insist upon a slow and thorough mastication of food,
especially of starchy food.Mastication is under the control of the
individual, and he refuses to exercise this salutary means of
prevention and cure at his own risk.The habit of chewing on both sides
should be cultivated.All habits which waste and weaken the saliva
should be given up, as smoking, chewing, and needless expectoration.Where the teeth are imperfect they should be attended to; false teeth
should replace absent ones.All means should be used for improving
gastric digestion: complete solution of food here means easier work for
the intestine, and sometimes the cure of intestinal indigestion by
removal of its cause.The rules which more directly bear upon the
subject of intestinal dyspepsia are these: All the causes which have
acted to bring about the disease should be removed.A change from a hot
climate to a cooler and dry one will sometimes have an immediate good
effect.Especially is this the case if travel is combined with change
of scene.The substitution of exercise for inertia, of fresh for
confined air, and the abandoning of occupations and habits of dress
which hinder the freedom of movement of the abdominal muscles are of
the highest importance.The patient should be made to cultivate
pleasure instead of work if his mind has been overtaxed in his
profession or business.Relaxation of the strained energies is
indispensable to recovery.This rule is as applicable to
school-children as it is to the overworked adult, man or woman.The
benefits of travel, with change of scene and air, cannot be
overestimated.Pedestrian tours in the mountains for young men, a trip
to Europe for men and women in middle life, will secure the best
results.For men who work much with their brains nothing is more
conducive to aiding intestinal digestion than manual labor in the
garden or workshop as a recreation.Exercise on horseback is
pleasurable and improves a sluggish abdominal circulation.Rowing is
good for younger men if it is confined to the field of pleasure, and is
not made a task.For very feeble persons, especially for women, massage
serves the purpose of exercise.The Swedish movement cure expands the
thorax and abdomen, hastens the circulation, and quickens all the
functions of nutrition and secretion.A course of treatment would be incomplete without suggestions as to
bathing.Life at the seashore would be of little service without the
daily plunge in the surf.Still salt-water bathing is better for
children and {633} delicate women.The reaction should be thorough to
secure the best results.It is much to be regretted that hydrotherapy
is not available and is not made use of more generally.A well-managed
establishment where appropriate regimen and good and sufficient food
could be combined with the renewal of the tissues by bathing would be
of great advantage in all forms of indigestion.Nearly all of the
benefit derived from the Hot Springs of Arkansas in chronic cachectic
diseases follows upon the immediate improvement of the digestion and
nutrition.The Warm and Hot Springs of Virginia have an equally good
effect upon torpid abdominal functions.The Russian bath, the very hot
bath, the cold plunge, the cold douche to the back or abdomen, and the
cold pack to the abdomen, are means which may be employed at home for
inducing a revolution ending in reform in the state of the digestive
organs.Irregularity in the hours of eating is of so much injury that rules
must be given to enforce uniform habits.Instead of the light breakfast
and heavy dinner, a good breakfast, a midday dinner, and a light tea
are to be preferred.It is of much value to regulate the appetite
according to the needs of the body and to avoid excess in everything.In this disease eating too little or starvation to a moderate degree
gives that rest to the intestine which is necessary to its restoration
to health.The selection of the food should not be left to the patient; the
dietary should be chosen for him with a view to lessening intestinal
labor.In general terms, this should consist of a moderate amount of
albuminoid food of the most digestible kind, and of farinaceous food
and fats in an acceptable and digestible form.In other words, as the
intestine digests proteids, starch, and fats, no exclusive diet can be
devised which will secure a perfect result.In each case the
examination of the stools and experience with different articles of
diet must be made the means for determining upon a suitable regimen.The exclusive milk diet is the best starting-point in feeding a patient
suffering from acute or chronic indigestion.In addition to the fact
that milk has all the elements of a perfect food, it contains sugar and
fat in the most favorable condition for absorption; the casein of milk
alone requires transformation into peptone.The pancreatic juice has
the greatest activity in its effect upon milk, as is easily
demonstrated by the artificial digestion of milk by pancreatic extract.In milk, therefore, we find a most easily digestible and most highly
nutritious food for such cases.Instead of milk with cream, skimmed
milk will be found sometimes to serve better the purpose of an
exclusive diet, because it has less fat and because larger quantities
can be taken without distaste or a sense of repletion.Koumiss may be
added to the milk diet; it is digestible, palatable, and nutritious.The peculiar and very active diastatic ferment of pancreatic juice
converts starch into sugar very readily.Farinaceous articles of diet
can be added to milk with advantage.Digestion takes place more slowly
and more thoroughly in consequence, and an additional article of
nutriment is obtained.Thus, milk can be diluted with a thick gruel of
barley or oatmeal, or some of the best of the various artificial foods
can be stirred in.To the milk diet may be added animal broths or soups
prepared with vegetables, animal jellies, or some of the ready-prepared
beef-essences.They may not in themselves be highly nutritious, but
they contain at least {634} the salts of meat, and act as stimulants to
the appetite and to the secreting glands.Such a rigid diet cannot be kept up for a very long time without
change; the appetite craves variety.Therefore solid albuminoid food in
small quantity may be added to milk and farinaceous diet.Sweetbread
boiled in milk, without dressing of any kind, is well suited for a
beginning of animal diet.Oysters for some palates make an agreeable
variety without putting much strain upon the digestive powers.They
should be eaten uncooked, as cooking in any way renders them less
digestible, and for greater precaution the hard part, or the adductor
muscle which serves to keep the two shells together, should be removed.Fish boiled or plainly cooked and eaten without sauce is very easily
digested.White-fleshed fish which has but little fat incorporated with
the muscle-fibre is to be preferred.The patient may have eggs uncooked
or slightly boiled, but one to two daily will be as much as he can well
digest.The meat of poultry and game, especially that from the wings
and breast, may be given even in a very feeble state of the digestive
organs.When a more solid or satisfying diet is craved the patient may
have beef or mutton cooked rare.Tripe and rabbit are suitable to some
cases.Bread, one day old and made light and porous, need not be denied the
patient.To many, well-made biscuits or
crackers are agreeable.Vegetables should be given in small quantities, as the intestine is
almost solely the seat of their digestion, and excess will tax too much
a function which should be allowed as much rest as possible.The green
vegetables contain less starch, and are therefore to be preferred.Lettuce, cabbage, kale, spinach, and celery come under this class, but
even these are to be given to patients under treatment in moderation,
with the intention of pleasing the palate rather than for purposes of
nutrition.Macaroni and rice are easily digested.Fruit contains very little nitrogenous matter and much water, and
therefore has but little nutritive value, but it may be given to
relieve the tedium of a restricted diet of milk or broths.Grapes,
oranges, figs, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and peaches are
the most digestible.Fruit-juices, especially if acid and fresh, are unobjectionable.Coffee
should not be allowed; its effect upon the nervous system is sufficient
objection to its use.Tea can be given diluted largely with milk;
cocoa, racahout, and broma are nutrient and make pleasant drinks.Sugar
need not be excluded if used sparingly, and butter and oil in
moderation may be permitted.If the stomach is not disturbed thereby, wine may be taken with food to
excite appetite.But except in the case of those who have always taken
it, and cannot do without it, it is better to dispense with alcohol
altogether.A red wine well diluted with water is a pleasant addition
to the meal.Old wine is to be preferred to new, as being softer and
less alcoholic.Good pure American wine from California or Virginia
will answer the purpose when reliable French wine cannot be secured.The value of mineral waters in the treatment of indigestion is great,
but without proper dietetic regimen they can accomplish but little.The
good results following a visit to Saratoga, Bedford, or other
watering-place are due to other causes than the waters.In combination,
however, {635} with the advantages of change of scene, air, good hours,
and a simple diet the mineral waters aid in bringing about a cure.They
are especially useful in men who drink too little water at home, in
gouty and plethoric subjects, and in states of acid stomach digestion
and chronic constipation.The alkaline and saline waters are the best,
the former containing a notable proportion of the carbonate or
bicarbonate of sodium, potassium, or lithium--the latter having neutral
salts in considerable quantity.The articles of food to be avoided are pastry, cheese, much butter or
fat, meat richly dressed or over-cooked, pork, veal, lobsters, crabs,
vegetable matter in excess, very cold or very hot fluids or solids.All of the methods so far described are designed to accelerate the
circulation in the abdominal organs and in the tissues generally, to
quicken the secretory and nutritive processes, and to give to the
intestinal secretions the foods which they can most readily digest.In
the event of such means failing to accomplish the desired end, is there
any direct stimulus which can be brought to bear on the intestinal
glands concerned in digestion?The pancreas being the most active and
most important of these, it would be desirable to have some agent which
could excite its gland-structure to greater activity.Sulphuric ether
has been found to have this effect; it may be given before meals.The
salivary secretion begins pancreatic digestion (the digestion of
starch), and therefore its outflow should be stimulated at the same
time; but thorough mastication does this usually without need of
further aid.When all plans fail to secure a thorough digestion in the intestine,
and unaltered food and fat are passed, while the patient grows thinner
and feebler daily, artificially-digested food may be given.The
intestine is thus relieved of labor, and time is given for a
restoration of activity by rest and an improved tone of all the tissues
and organs.Rice, bread, baked flour, potatoes, or barley may be given
in combination with malt extract, which converts starch into
grape-sugar and dextrin.As pancreatic juice acts both upon proteids and starch, an extract of
the pancreas has a more general application than an extract of the
stomach--pepsin.Roberts of Manchester has given full directions for
the method of digesting food by pancreatic extract.Beef, milk, and the
farinacea may be digested, the albuminoid substances being changed into
peptones, the starchy matters into dextrin and sugar, capable of being
absorbed readily with but little or no further alteration in the
digestive tract.[18] Pancreatic emulsion (Dobell) is another method of
giving fat emulsified.[Footnote 18: Fresh pancreatic extract is made by cutting into small
pieces the pancreas of the pig (which is the best), the ox, or sheep.The pancreas of the calf yields an extract which acts only on
albuminous substances, but not on starchy matters.The divided pieces
of the pancreas, well freed from fat, are put in a well-corked,
wide-mouthed bottle with four times their weight of dilute alcohol (one
part of rectified spirit to three parts of water).The mixture should
be agitated once daily: at the end of a week the mixture is filtered
through paper until it is clear.A well-made liquid extract of pancreas
is made and sold by Metcalfe of Boston, and a solid extract by
Fairchild Bros.No doubt improvements will be
made in the processes of manufacture of these extracts, and better
results will in time be obtained from their use.]A less successful way of gaining the same object is by administering
the pancreatic extract internally.The difficulty lies in conveying the
extract (the ferment of which is destroyed by the acid gastric juice)
through the stomach in safety.This chemical danger is thought to be
obviated by giving the extract one to two hours after eating with a
{636} protecting guard of an alkali, the bicarbonate of sodium; but the
mechanical difficulty of securing direct transit through the stomach to
the intestine early enough and in quantity enough to digest the
duodenal contents is as great as the chemical obstacle.It is very
doubtful whether this method of use can be of any real service.In those cases in which the form of indigestion is due to, or is
associated with, a deficient hepatic secretion--a condition indicated
by offensive and light- stools and other symptoms--it is
advisable to stimulate the liver to increased secretion.It is probable
that the same remedies which excite a flow of bile do at the same time
stimulate the pancreas.The best of these are euonymin, sanguinarin,
iridin, ipecacuanha, colocynth, jalap, podophyllin, sodium sulphate,
and potassium sulphate.Sodium benzoate, ammonium benzoate, and the
salicylate of sodium are also powerful hepatic stimulants.As one of
the purposes of the bile is to create the alkaline medium necessary for
pancreatic digestion, the administration of an alkaline[19] solution in
full doses, as in the form of mineral water, when gastric digestion is
finished, may make amends for the lack of bile.A combination of an
antiseptic and the alkali may to some extent supply the deficiency
still better, as the bile is the antiseptic of the intestinal canal.[Footnote 19: The waters of Ems, Vichy (Grande Ville or Hopital
Springs), Vals, or Bilin may be used for this purpose.]Atony of the intestinal wall leads to flatulence, colics, and
constipation, and would be a cause of indigestion if none other
existed.It is to be treated by the general rules already given, by
electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles with the faradic
current, or by the effort to stimulate the intestinal wall more
effectively with the galvanic current.Strychnia in small doses should
be given for some time.In women of relaxed muscular fibre with
enlarged abdomens an elastic belt may be worn with advantage.After the special aids to the parts concerned in digestion, tonics are
called for to combat the general want of tone and anaemia.The
saccharated iron, the carbonate, potassio-tartrate, lactate,
pyrophosphate, or the ferrum redactum may be given.The syrup of the
iodide of iron is the best form for children.The bitter tonics are
inadvisable except for loss of appetite in cases where the stomach is
not disordered.Quinia is available in a large number of cases in which
malarial influence plays a part.Strychnia is a good general tonic, and
may be prescribed combined with mineral acids, particularly with the
dilute hydrochloric acid.The special symptoms which call for treatment are flatulence, abdominal
pains, and constipation.All the remedies already described are
directed toward their relief.But sometimes they appear in so
exaggerated a form as to need immediate attention.The many remedies
for colic and tympanitic distension which have the property of
relieving spasm and absorbing gas find application in these conditions.Constipation is not to be treated by laxatives if it can be avoided.But the bitter waters, Friedrichshall, Pullna, Hunyadi Janos, and
Rakoczy, by exciting bile outflow, are sometimes of undoubted curative
value.The form of dyspepsia called strumous, as it occurs in children of
anaemic appearance with dry skin covered with minute scales, and with
bad breath and light ill-smelling stools, demands a very thorough and
{637} persevering treatment.The advantages of climate must be
sought--seashore in summer with bathing, dry and moderately warm air in
winter.Outdoor life in the sun, with active exercise, is to be had at
the expense of education within-doors.Study is not good for children
of this class except when health is made paramount to it.Cod-liver
oil, either pure, in phosphatic emulsion, or in the pancreatic
emulsion, is a necessity.Malt extract with the hypophosphites is
beneficial.The food must be carefully selected, and the child educated

CONSTIPATION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Costiveness, Fecal retention, Fecal accumulation, Alvine
obstruction, Obstipation._Ger._ Koprostase, Stuhlverstopfung,
Hartleibigkeit, Kothstanung._Fr._ Constipation, Paresse du ventre,
Echauffement.Older synonyms: Constipatio vel
obstipatio alvi; Alvus tarda, dura, adstricta; Tarda alvi dejectio;
Obstipatio alvarina; Stypsis; Coprostasis (Good).NATURE AND DEFINITION.--The act of defecation is almost wholly due to
the working of an involuntary mechanism which may be set in play by the
will, and is in part dominated by it, but which is frequently
independent and uncontrolled by volition.Deep inspiration, closure of
the glottis, downward pressure of the diaphragm, and contraction of the
abdominal muscles are accessory, but not essential, to the expulsion of
feces from the rectum.In certain persons, and occasionally in all
persons, especially in diseases where the fecal mass is in a semi-fluid
or fluid form, the strongest effort of the will cannot resist the
expulsive contractions of the rectal muscle.The sphincter is kept in a
state of tonic contraction by a nervous centre situated in the lumbar
portion of the spinal cord.The fecal mass, supported by the bladder
and the rectum, does not at first touch the sphincter; the rectum is
usually empty; but when the column has been well driven into the rectum
peristaltic action is excited in the rectal walls and the sphincter is
firmly pressed upon.The lumbar sphincter centre is now inhibited, and
the ring of muscle opens, the accessory and voluntary muscles contract,
and the expulsive act is completed.In the well-ordered and healthy
individual the rectal walls and the sphincter do not receive the
maximum of irritation from pressure of the advancing column but once in
twenty-four hours.The habit of having one movement in each day is, it
may be believed, in accordance with the natural and physiological
demand, although both the number and the hours of evacuating are fixed
to a great extent by education.The habit once established, the
mechanism of expulsion recurs at the same hour and entirely without the
direction of the will.If the desire be resisted, it will be most apt
not to return until the same hour on the next day.Defecation depends for its normal character upon the healthy
functioning of the organism, but especially upon the normal processes
of digestion.The character of the rectal contents as to composition
and consistence, and the time of the arrival of the mass at the
sphincter, are {639} regulated by the taking of food at stated hours
and by its normal digestion and absorption.Unaltered or partly-changed
remains of the ingesta pass down the bowel, mingling with the secretion
from the intestinal glands and with mucus and epithelium.As this mass
passes into and through the colon, being propelled by regular
peristaltic waves, it acquires odor from the development of a substance
which is a final product of the putrefaction of albumen.[1] Gradually
the more fluid elements are absorbed, and in the descending colon a
less fluid or semi-solid consistence of the feces is reached.A healthy
digestion and assimilation, with active and regular contractile
movements of the muscular walls of the small and large intestines, are
essential to normal defecation.[Footnote 1: Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.Constipation may be defined to be that condition in which there is a
prolonged retention of the feces or in which they are habitually
expelled with difficulty or in insufficient quantity.[2] While there
are individual peculiarities due to habit or nature, the custom with
most persons of having one movement in the twenty-four hours would
cause any longer retention of the rectal contents to be considered
constipation.The limits between health and disease are not well
defined, and a failure to evacuate the bowels for several days need not
be considered pathological nor require medical interference.In persons
otherwise in good health such an occurrence due to neglect, change of
habit or diet, as in travelling, would cause no interruption to health
or comfort.Nature brings relief sooner or later and re-establishes
order and regularity.In many cases constipation is a primary disease
and the cause of many secondary disturbances, but it is often the
effect or the symptom of various acute and chronic diseases.[Footnote 2: Cases of constipation due to mechanical obstruction from
changes in the wall of the intestine or to exterior pressure will not
be considered in this article.]In long-continued constipation the intestinal contents are so retarded
in their progression along the canal that they undergo a too early and
too complete absorption of their fluid portion.In time there are an
accumulation and impaction of dry fecal masses in the rectum, sigmoid
flexure, descending transverse colon, or caecum.An obstacle is thus
created which may ultimately close the tube entirely and cause
intestinal obstruction.It
is the effect of loss of peristaltic force and of a diminution of
sensibility in the lower bowel, and is associated with general
functional inactivity and with muscular degeneration and obesity.Infants are more subject to constipation than children of one year and
over.In many instances this is due to artificial feeding with cow's
milk, condensed milk, and the patent foods so largely used, or with any
diet unsuited to the digestive organs.Imperfect digestion of casein or
other food, the filling of the bowel with a dry mass difficult to
propel, and the consequent catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, are
causes of both constipation and diarrhoea.Feeble, delicate children
with imperfect muscular development, and children born rachitic,
scrofulous, or syphilitic, are generally constipated.Women are prone to constipation much more than men.False modesty,
which imposes restraint upon young girls, and their ignorance {640} of
the necessity of regularity, their habits of indoor life, and avoidance
of exercise, are largely the causes of this.But the anatomical
structure and physiological life of the woman offer another
explanation.At every menstrual period the uterus enlarges and
exercises a greater compression upon the rectum.A tender and enlarged
ovary (and at the menstrual epoch the ovary is always tender and
enlarged) exercises an inhibiting action upon the muscles which bring
the feces in contact with it in their downward passage.In the married
woman recurring pregnancies lead to the habit of constipation from the
long-continued pressure upon the colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum,
from the extreme stretching of the abdominal muscles, and from the
paralyzing effect of compression during labor.The relaxed condition of
the pelvic and abdominal organs after labor offers no resistance to the
distension of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The cessation of the
catamenia is accompanied with constipation, nervousness, and a feeling
of ill-defined apprehension when the bowels are moved, or abdominal
pains deter many persons, chiefly women, from habits of regularity.All
uterine and ovarian derangements by mechanical or reflex means bring
about the same result.Chlorosis and anaemia in girls are almost
invariably associated with constipation.Hereditary influence shows itself very markedly in the tendency to
constipation which is seen in many members of the same family.This is
probably more often apparent than real, and is the result of neglect of
the proper attention to the wants of children and of the perpetuation
of vicious habits of taking purgatives.The habits of life and the occupation of the individual have much to
do with the causation of constipation.Those who lead active outdoor
lives are generally regular in their daily movements, but persons of
sedentary pursuits or who work in constrained attitudes--lawyers,
clerks, tailors, shoemakers, and seamstresses--are predisposed to
constipation.Intellectual work, not only from the muscular inactivity
which it entails, but from the diversion of energy to the
nerve-centres, develops the constipated habit as well as indigestion.Men who are overworked in business, employes in banks, government
offices, shops, etc., bring on the habit from the hurry incident to
their occupations.Luxurious and enervating habits of life, over-eating
and sloth, with the over-indulgence in alcohol and tobacco, have the
same effect.All the influences which deteriorate health, such as bad
ventilation and over-heating of rooms, foul air, want of cleanliness of
the person, indigestible food, imperfect mastication, tight-lacing in
women, compression of the abdominal organs in men, can be said to share
in bringing it about.Servants, especially women, are constipated more
frequently than their masters.This is due to ignorance and neglect,
and sometimes to excessive tea-drinking and irregularity in eating.Neglect to establish or continue a habit of daily regularity in
defecation leads to the accumulation in the rectum of masses of feces.Resisting the desire to empty the bowel interrupts the necessary reflex
acts, and finally the muscular excitability and response to the
presence of feces are entirely wanting.The continued contact of fecal
matter with the mucous membrane wears out its susceptibility; the
over-distension of the rectum enfeebles the power of its muscular wall,
as is the case when all hollow muscular organs--stomach, heart,
bladder--are overstretched.Thus a {641} neglect to answer the demand
for a daily movement and the failure to completely empty the rectum
will gradually develop constipation in a person who has before been
perfectly well regulated.In childhood failure to teach and to insist
upon good habits is the cause of much of the trouble of after-life.Acute and chronic diseases of the brain and spinal cord bring about
constipation.Meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis, senile dementia
and softening, have it as a symptom at some time or other.In
encephalitis and myelitis there is an interruption of motor
nerve-currents.In meningitis and tetanus the muscular walls of the
bowel and the abdominal muscles are in a state of tonic contraction.The use of aperients is an important agent in developing the
constipated habit by over-stimulating and wearing out muscular
activity.The idea that a daily movement is a necessity, and that an
occasional purgative is useful in relieving the system of morbid matter
which would otherwise induce disease, is the chief source of this
hurtful custom.The traditional meaning attached to the term
biliousness implied the resort to cathartics for its relief, and it is
much to be regretted that with our more advanced knowledge the effort
should be made to revive the use of this term, which was wellnigh
abandoned.More ignorance and erroneous treatment has hung upon the
theory of biliousness than upon any other doctrine of medicine within
the past thirty years: it is well for physicians to condemn it and to
resist its reintroduction into scientific phraseology.[3] If the term
bilious as applied to diseases were abandoned, much good would come of
it.The general use of purgative mineral waters has added to this evil.Among the better classes these waters play the same part as the liver
regulators and vegetable pills do among laborers and servant-maids.Both gratify the innate love for self-medication by a resort to
cathartics for the slightest ailment.At first the injurious effects
are not apparent, but in time the reflex function is not brought into
activity except by artificial aids.The intestinal and rectal muscles
must be whipped into action, their normal contractile power being lost.[Footnote 3: For an excellent and dispassionate statement of the
reasons for abandoning the theory of the influences of bile as a cause
of disease, and the use of the term bilious, consult _The Bile,
Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, by J. Wickham Legg, chaps.The Hippocratic and Galenical belief has been transmitted with
but little alteration through Stoll, Andrie, Abernethy, and Copland to
the writers of to-day on biliousness.]Certain vegetable and mineral substances taken either intentionally
or by accident constipate the bowels.Chief among these stand opium and
its preparations.All opium-eaters are constipated.Lead which is
accidentally taken into the system by workers in metals, painters, etc.The use of tobacco in
excess has the effect of deranging digestion and causing constipation
in many persons, but this result is occasional only.Chronic diseases of the lungs and heart, by enfeebling the muscular
movements which take part in defecation, as well as by the general
feebleness and the chronic intestinal catarrh and indigestion which
they create, are causes of constipation.Chronic diseases of the liver,
especially cirrhosis, are also causes.Constipation accompanies
obesity, for in very fat persons the abdominal walls have but little
power of contraction; the {642} muscle-layer is thin and flaccid.There
is also in such persons in advanced life an accumulation of fat in the
mesentery and around the colon.The muscle of the bowel is in a state
of fatty degeneration, and atony and dilatation of the gut follow.Painful affections about the rectum and anus deter persons from
yielding to the desire for defecation.Fissure of the anus is the
principal one of these, but fistula, hemorrhoids, and local eczema have
a similar influence.A simple rigidity or spasmodic stricture of the
anal sphincter creates constipation.[4]

[Footnote 4: Kunemann, _De la Constipation compliques de Contraction du
Sphincter anal, et de son Traitement par la Dilatation de l'Anus_,
Paris, 1851.]Constipation is a symptom in chronic cachexiae and wasting
diseases, in the convalescence of acute exhausting illness, as typhoid
fever and pneumonia, or in persons bedridden from any cause.Defective
nutrition and degeneration of the muscle-fibre of the intestine explain
these cases.In some of them, with improved nutrition, regeneration
takes place with a return of contractility.Disorders of the digestive system have constipation as a
consequence and a symptom.The reflex sympathy between the movements of
the stomach and of the intestines brings this about in gastric
diseases.[5] It occurs in gastric cancer and ulcer, in acute and
chronic gastritis, in dilatation of the stomach, and in pyloric
stricture.The small amount of ingesta entering the duodenum in these
diseases diminishes the bulk of fecal matter.In acute intestinal
catarrh diarrhoea is the rule, but the bowels may be constipated in
intense inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane, as is often
the case in typhoid fever.In chronic intestinal catarrh constipation
is more common in the mild forms than diarrhoea.The thickening and
irritation of the mucous membrane lead to a diminution of reflex
excitability and loss of elasticity and contractility in the muscular
coat.Hence, except in cases where the inflammation is low down or
where ulcers have formed, constipation is a more frequent symptom than
diarrhoea.The alteration in the quantity and character of the
intestinal secretions in chronic catarrh is stated to be an important
element.Mucus, which is the chief product
of this condition, leads to indigestion and fermentation of the
intestinal contents and to increased irritation of the mucous membrane.The evolved gas distends the bowel and weakens its contractile power.The fecal mass when it reaches the rectum has an excess of mucus within
it or around it which makes its expulsion more difficult.But the
diminution or absence of bile does not constipate.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is not uncommon, and an excess of bile does not of necessity
cause diarrhoea.[6]

[Footnote 5: Leube, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 6: Legg, _op.The effects of the modifications of the pancreatic secretion are not
well known.Pancreatitis is attended by constipation.Fatty diarrhoea
is believed to follow occlusion of the pancreatic duct by pancreatic
calculi and chronic catarrh of the duct.Peristalsis is lost in
peritonitis from the muscular coat being infiltrated with serum and
paralyzed, but tuberculous peritonitis is frequently accompanied by
diarrhoea.Loss of fluids by abundant perspiration, by diuresis, diabetes and
lactation, increases the dryness of the bowel contents and hinders free
{643} evacuations.This is observed as a result of the arrival in a
tropical climate and in very hot weather in any climate.The profuse
sweats accompanying phthisis, acute rheumatism, intermittent fever, and
unusual exercise cause constipation.Another explanation which applies
to this has been offered by Good and Eberle, who ascribe constipation
to the excessive action of the absorbents in the small intestine, by
which the fluid portion is too rapidly and too thoroughly removed.[7]
Exercise by promoting activity of the functions in general may induce
constipation in this way.In spermatorrhoea the stools are infrequent.An insufficient amount of water taken with food is another cause.[Footnote 7: Dick, _Braithwaite's Retrospect_, xvii.Food which has but little waste to be got rid of--as milk or
beef--leaves a small residuum to be propelled along the intestine, and
therefore in one sense is constipating.Insufficient food acts in the
same way.An indigestible diet in excess, especially vegetable food, a
large part of which is insoluble, constipates by filling the bowel with
matter which cannot be got rid of, and chronic catarrh results.The
stones and seeds of fruits, as cherry- and plum-stones, raspberry- and
currant-seeds, husks of corn and oats, produce acute or chronic
constipation with serious symptoms.Intestinal worms (generally
lumbricoids) when in large numbers cause obstruction of the bowel;[8]
and various foreign substances taken by caprice or to take the place of
food have produced the same result: among these stick cinnamon,[9]
sawdust,[10] and clay (among the clay-eaters of the South) have been
mentioned.Magnesia, insoluble pills, and other medicines sometimes
form concretions in the bowel.Enteroliths and accidental concretions
form in the intestinal canal and are sources of obstruction.Any
foreign body is a nucleus around which concentric layers of phosphate
of lime are deposited, and thus a hard calculus is formed.Gall-stones
may pass into the canal and there accumulate in such numbers as to
interfere with the passage of the fecal matter.[Footnote 8: Copland, _Medical Repository_, vol.[Footnote 9: Ware, _Boston Med.and Surgical Journal_, 1858, vol.[Footnote 10: Bonney, _ibid._, 1859, vol.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In cases where constipation has lasted many
years no alteration of the parts involved may be found.When lesions do
occur the pathological anatomy includes changes in the position,[11]
calibre, and in the walls and contents of the intestines.The most
common displacement is that of the transverse colon, which is depressed
in its centre; the acute angle of the descending part may reach as far
down as the hypogastrium.The caecum sometimes lies in the centre of
the abdomen.Dislocations of the intestines are congenital, due to
anomalies of intra-uterine development, in which case they become
causes of death in newly-born children from obstruction, or if
insufficient to cause death they establish habitual and incurable
constipation; or constipation may bring about displacement by the
greater weight of a portion of the bowel constantly loaded with fecal
matter.[Footnote 11: Votsch, _Koprostase_, Erlangen, 1874.]The sigmoid flexure is usually the seat of the greatest dilatation; its
expansion may be a cause or a consequence of constipation.[12] It may
reach a maximum of distension when it fills the entire abdominal
cavity, compressing all the abdominal organs and pushing the stomach,
liver, {644} and intestines into the thorax.In a case of this kind the
circumference of the dilated part was twenty-seven inches.[13] The
descending colon may be distended with the sigmoid flexure, or the
whole colon may be dilated from the upper part of the rectum to the
caecum;[14] the same thing happens rarely in the small intestine.In
one case, in which there was an accumulation of feces in the sigmoid
flexure, the large intestine presented itself as two immense cylinders
lying side by side, extending from the epigastrium to the pelvis.[15]
Each was about five and a half inches in diameter, and together they
filled the abdominal cavity.The circumference of the stretched colon
varies from ten to thirty inches.Pouches forming little rounded tumors
are seen on the outer surface of the colon; they are sometimes hernial
protrusions of the mucous membrane through the muscular coat (Wilks and
Moxon), or if large they are dilatations of the pouches of the
colon.[16]

[Footnote 12: Trastour, "De la Dilatation passive de l'Iliaque, et de
ses consequences," _Journal de Med.de l'Ouest_, 1878-79, tome xii.[Footnote 13: Dupleix, _Le Progres medicale_, Paris, 1877, tome v. p.[Footnote 14: Peacock, "Fatal Constipation, with Excessive Dilatation
of the Colon," _Tr.[Footnote 15: Lewitt, _Chicago Med.[Footnote 16: Gay, "Sacculated Colon, Prolonged Constipation," _Tr.But little weight can be
attached to this anomaly, as there is a difference in the length of the
colon in different nations and individuals, depending upon the
character of the food, being longer in those who eat largely of
vegetable food.[17]

[Footnote 17: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The mucous membrane is normal or hyperaemic, or is in various stages of
chronic catarrh.Proctitis may exist with follicular ulcers; ulcers
form in the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and in the bends of the colon;
perforations and peritonitis rarely occur.Chronic peritonitis has
resulted from the stretching of the bowel from retained and hardened
feces; adhesions may form which ultimately cause death by obstructing
the canal.The walls of the intestines are in long-standing cases much
thinned.There are many reasons to believe that fatty degeneration of
the smooth muscular fibre takes place, in consequence of which it loses
its contractile power and atrophies.This lesion is most common in
advanced life, and accompanies fatty accumulation and degeneration
elsewhere.Its results would be constipation, distension of the bowel
with gas, and sometimes symptoms of intestinal obstruction.[18] A
thinned and dilated bowel may easily be lacerated under unusual
stimulation, as from a purgative.In a case recently seen by the writer
such an accident, rupture of the colon and death from peritonitis,
occurred from the effects of an active purge taken to bring on
abortion.Hypertrophy of the wall, especially of the muscular coat,
coexists with dilatation, and is most common in the upper part of the
rectum and sigmoid flexure.It is caused by overwork in expelling fecal
accumulations.The walls never become as much thickened as in
constipation from organic stricture.[Footnote 18: Cases are recorded of death with symptoms of intestinal
obstruction in which no lesion was found beyond a dilated colon; as,
for example, in _British Medical Journal_, April, 1879, p.Collections of fecal matter may be found in any portion of the colon,
but more frequently in the rectum, sigmoid flexure, descending or {645}
transverse colon, or caecum.They lie within the intestinal tube,
partly or wholly occluding it, or within lateral pouches, forming
tumors which are sometimes quite large.In this last form there is no
obstacle to the free passage of feces along the canal.Fecal
accumulations occur as small round, oval, or irregularly-shaped lumps
(scybalae), and are often covered with layers of transparent semi-fluid
mucus, puriform mucus, or mucus in filaments.The small concretions
vary in density; they may be so hard as to resist the knife, and may be
mistaken for gall-stones; larger masses, semi-solid or solid, are most
commonly seen in the rectum and sigmoid flexure.Here the collection
may reach an immense size.In one case fifteen quarts of semi-solid,
greenish- fecal matter were removed at the autopsy.[19] In two
other cases the weight of the feces found in the bowel was thirteen and
a half[20] and twenty-six pounds[21] respectively.The whole colon from
the anus to the caecum may be filled with such a mass, as in a case
mentioned by Bristowe, where the colon "was completely full of
semi-solid olive-green  feces.The small intestines were also
considerably distended,... and were filled throughout with semi-fluid
olive-green contents."[22]

[Footnote 19: Peacock, _Tr.[Footnote 20: Lamazurier, _Archives generales_, Paris, 1824, t. iv.[Footnote 21: Chelius, _Heidelberg Med.[Footnote 22: Bristowe, "Diseases of Intestines and Peritoneum,"
_Wood's Library_, New York, 1879, p.The color of these collections is black, reddish, deep green, or
yellow.In composition the scybalae, concretions, and larger masses
consist of fecal matter, with unaltered vegetable fibre; they may be
composed partly of skins of grapes, cherry-stones, biliary calculi,
hair, woody fibre, magnesia, or other foreign substances.Where fecal
concretions long remain in the intestine they acquire a hardness like
stone, and can with the microscope only be distinguished from mineral
matter.[23] Hemorrhoidal tumors, anal fissures, perirectal abscesses,
fistulae communicating externally or with the gut, are found in
connection with constipation.Abscess of the iliac fossa has been
observed in the same relationship.[24]

[Footnote 23: A remarkable case is recorded (_Dictionnaire de
Medecine_, Paris, 1834, t. viii.435) in which an ulcerating cancer
of the fundus of the uterus had opened communication and formed
adhesions with the small intestine, from whence the feces passed into
the uterus and out through the vagina.The large intestine, totally
occluded, contained petrified fecal matter.][Footnote 24: Richet, "Abscess of Iliac Fossa," _Revue de Therapeutique
medico-chirurgicale_, 1876, p.SYMPTOMS.--In persons who have a daily movement an occasional
interruption of two to four days may take place without local or
general signs of inconvenience.It is often asserted by patients that
one day's omission induces suffering, and recourse is immediately had
to laxatives.This may be justified sometimes, but in the majority of
cases no actual suffering follows a very rare and short
constipation.[25] If, however, symptoms do occur after a constipation
of one to three days, there is a sense of fulness and heat about the
rectum which is greater after stool; when the bowels are moved, it is
with effort (provided that no enema or purgative has been taken), and
the bulk of the expelled mass is much greater {646} than usual, being
moulded and hardened from its longer retention in the rectum.The
margins of the anus are tender, and the unsatisfied feeling after stool
is due to distension of the hemorrhoidal veins and oedema of the
tissues around them--a condition which ends in painful or bleeding
hemorrhoids.There are signs of impaired digestion, loss of appetite, a
coated tongue, oppression after eating and flatulence, and distension
of the abdomen.Headache is apt to be present, with flushing of the
face and general discomfort or irritability of temper.These phenomena
may all disappear within two or three days by a spontaneous stool or by
the use of a purgative.[Footnote 25: Some interesting remarks in connection with the idea that
constipation is not necessarily hurtful, and is in some cases
beneficial, may be found in a pamphlet by C. I. Harris, _Is our
Physiology of the Large Intestine correct, and is Constipation in
certain cases as Injurious as is supposed?_ London, 1878.]Acute symptoms of a violent nature are sometimes developed in persons
who have been constipated a long or short time, in consequence of
attempts at purgation or from the accumulation of indigestible food.Violent paroxysmal pains in the abdomen and efforts at stool are soon
followed by symptoms of intestinal obstruction and serious collapse.Quick relief follows a free movement from the bowels obtained by an
enema, or if not so relieved the case may terminate fatally.A frequent recurrence of fecal retention from the causes mentioned will
in time develop the constipated habit.Distension of the rectum
increases its capacity and destroys its sensibility and expulsive
power.The colon above the point of stoppage is distended with gas and
weakened.The bowels are rarely moved spontaneously, and finally are
never emptied without artificial aid.The literature of medicine
contains many extraordinary records of prolonged fecal retention,
ranging from a few weeks to many months.[26]

months and twenty-two days); Renaudin, _Dict.257 (four months); Strong, _Am.Sci._, Oct., 1874, p.440

they should be; they are passed in masses of various sizes, and in
color are brown, black, dark-green, or yellow.Sometimes a coating of
mucus is on the outside, and sometimes streaks of blood, or there is an
intimate admixture of mucus, giving a slimy, gelatinous appearance to
the mass.Semi-digested food, as partly-altered milk, meat, or
vegetable matter, is seen, and quite frequently there is an
intercurrent diarrhoea which alternates with costiveness.The local symptoms about the pelvis and anal opening and in the lower
extremities come from the pressure of accumulations of feces.Thus,
compression of the iliac veins delays circulation in the lower
extremities; cold feet or oedema of the feet and ankles and varicose
veins follow.If the pressure is on the ilio-hypogastric and
ilio-inguinal nerves, there are neuralgic pains in the groin and over
the crest of the ilium.The sciatic and crural nerves may be the seats
of pain.Varicocele is the effect of weight upon the spermatic veins.Erections and seminal emissions in men follow pressure on the pubic
veins and prostatic portion of the urethra.Retention of urine also may
come from the latter cause.If the kidneys and ureters are compressed
by fecal tumors in the descending or transverse {647} colon, nephritic
pain, albuminuria, or retraction of the testicle, with delay in the
escape of urine, may happen.Icterus and its consequences are owing to
pressure on the common bile-duct; the liver and other organs may be
displaced and the aortic circulation obstructed by fecal compression.In women the retention of fecal matter in the rectum is the source of
special symptoms; it contributes largely to the occurrence of cervical
anti-flexion in the soft, pliable, growing uterus of girlhood (Thomas),
and unites with retroversion in women who have borne children to
produce great suffering.An unnatural state of the digestive system, as a cause or result, is
the invariable accompaniment of chronic constipation.The appetite is
wanting; the tongue is coated, and may be pale, soft, and indented by
the teeth.Distress follows eating; the abdomen is distended with gas
and is hard; all the evidences of gastric or intestinal indigestion may
be found.Nutrition is imperfect, as is shown in loss of flesh and in
the signs of functional disorder to be next described.The nervous system is soon deranged; sleep is unrefreshing, restless,
and disturbed by dreams.There are headache and mental and physical
indolence.The patient speaks of being giddy, faint, and nervous.Disturbance of vision (muscae volitantes), of hearing (tinnitus
aurium), and alarming attacks of dyspnoea and cardialgia may occur.[27]
Heart-palpitations and profuse perspirations are the effect of
excitement or effort of any kind.Chilliness or violent chills can be
traced to this cause also.In women hysteria, disturbed menses,
anaemia, and chlorosis accompany constipation.[Footnote 27: C. C. Melhose, _Hufeland's Journal_, 1841, xcii., Stuch
iv.Nervous symptoms are very common in the young, and it is doubtful
whether they are consequences of constipation or whether they form a
part of a general state of malnutrition and anaemia.Hypochondria is
undoubtedly closely connected with the constipated habit, and the
failure to secure a daily movement becomes the subject of unceasing
thought and anxiety.Hallucinations and sudden loss of consciousness,
aphasia,[28] and delirium, have been found to depend upon fecal
accumulation.[29] The absorption of fluids and gases from
too-long-retained and decomposing feces may explain such cases.The
nerve-centres soon show the effect of the supply of altered or
contaminated blood.[30] It is probable that the marked nervous symptoms
are more due to this cause than to reflex influences.[Footnote 28: Mattei, "Aphasia cured by relieving Constipation," _Bull.[Footnote 29: Pulitzer, _Wien.Presse_, 1866, x. p.42, with sleeplessness, hypochondriasis, hallucinations, and
one attack of sudden loss of consciousness; symptoms relieved by
removing a large quantity of fetid fecal matter from bowels.Also

(_Bulletin de Therap._, Paris, t.[Footnote 30: Bell, _Lancet_, London, 1880, i.A coincidence exists between dislocation of the colon and various
states of mental disturbance.Ten cases of suicide were seen by Votsch
in which there were displacements of the colon.Laudenberger of
Stuttgart found that in ninety-four autopsies of insane persons there
were anomalies of position of the transverse colon in one-seventh of
the number (Votsch).Fever is not infrequently due to constipation.During the course of
typhoid and other fevers an unusual elevation of temperature is often
{648} traced to a neglect to have the bowels emptied.But very high
temperature sometimes depends upon constipation alone, and is at once
reduced by removing the cause.This may occur in the course of chronic
diseases or in health, especially in children.[31] The temperature
rises from normal to 104 degrees F., and even higher, and immediately
drops to normal when the bowels are moved.When a sudden rise in
temperature comes with acute constipation, the influence must be a
reflected one from the mucous surface to the heat-centre.[Footnote 31: F. Barnes, "On the Pyrexial Effects of Constipation,"

_Boston Med.The urine is dark- and scanty, loaded often with urates, or it
may be limpid and of a very low specific gravity.The escape from the
bladder and through the ureters may be obstructed by compression, as
already mentioned.Suppression of urine has occurred, and been relieved
by removing large fecal collections.[32] In women catamenial
irregularity and dysuria are generally associated with constipation.Disturbances in pelvic circulation and local pressure of a distended
rectum explain these conditions.[Footnote 32: Barnwell, _Cincin.Had no movement for five days; suffered with
tympanites; severe pain in right iliac region, with persistent
vomiting; tumor in same region; complete suppression of urine.At the
end fifth day passed large quantity of apple-peelings and fecal matter.Return of flow of urine; passed two gallons in ten hours.]The skin is often parched, sallow, and is sometimes covered with
eruptions, as acne, psoriasis, eczema, erythema, or prurigo.Injuries,
wounds, and cracks of the skin heal slowly.RESULTS AND COMPLICATIONS.--The lateral pouches of the colon, most
commonly at the sigmoid flexure, become distended, and deeper pouches
are formed, where fecal matter is retained.[33] This need not interfere
with the regular daily movements.Fecal tumors are thus formed, the
nature of which is often not recognized.The colon may be distended so
as to fill a large part of the abdomen.The pressure of hardened feces
brings about ulceration of the mucous membrane, perforation and
extravasation of the contents into the abdominal cavity, with fatal
peritonitis.Abscesses in the perirectal tissues, with fistulae,[34]
anal fissures, hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, varices of the
prostate gland and bladder, owe their origin to fecal collections,
especially in advanced life.Times and Gazette_, 1856, vol.[Footnote 34: Bannerot, C., _Du Phlegmon pelvi-rectal inferieure et de
la Fistule de l'Anus consecutive causees par la Constipation_, Paris,
1880.]Intussusception has been attributed to the weight of a mass of feces.Typhlitis and perityphlitis may come from retention in the caecum.Pressure upon the viscera brings about derangements in their functions,
many of which have already been described.From straining at stool a
hernia, haemoptysis, or cerebral hemorrhage may happen.Cases have been
reported of death from rupture of an aneurism of the aorta while at
stool, and J. F. Hartigan met with a case of spontaneous rupture of the
aorta, where the vessel was apparently but little diseased, occurring
in a man aged sixty during the act of defecation.[35]

[Footnote 35: Hartigan, _Tr.See also same number for a valuable paper on
spontaneous rupture of aorta, by J. J.{649} The effects upon the general system are those connected with
malnutrition.The health may be profoundly altered and death occur from
secondary diseases.Many general symptoms are due to the retention in
the blood of excrementitious matters or to their reabsorption.[36]

DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of constipation is not difficult except in
hysterical women, who select this as one of their subjects of
deception.Primary must be distinguished from secondary constipation,
the last being a symptom of some general or local disease.The history
of the case and the predominating symptoms will be guides to a
decision, but constipation should be regarded as a symptom until it is
proved to be otherwise.The tendency is to look upon it and to treat it
as a distinct malady; important organic changes elsewhere may thus be
overlooked.Simple habitual constipation may be mistaken for
constipation due to lesions in the wall of the intestine or to closure
from the external pressure of tumors.Slowly-developed symptoms of obstruction may come from polypoid growths
or benign tumors in the rectum, colon, caecum, duodenum, and ileum.The diagnosis can only be made
when the growth is in the rectum or when the tumor is expelled from the
bowel.Cancerous obstruction is accompanied by cachectic changes, by
the presence of an abdominal or rectal tumor, the passage of blood and
mucus, and violent rectal or abdominal pain.Primary cancer in the
small intestine appears in the form of lymphoma; it readily ulcerates,
and rather widens than narrows the channel of the bowel.[37]

[Footnote 37: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.Anat._, Philada., 1875, p.Stricture of the bowel is most commonly found low down in the rectum or
sigmoid flexure, within reach of the finger or exploring bougie.If
high up, it can only be diagnosed by exclusion and by its slow
progression from bad to worse.Syphilis or dysentery has nearly always
preceded the development of stricture.Tumors in the abdomen or pelvis compress the colon, and while they are
small they may be overlooked; sooner or later they grow so as to be
recognized.The presence of gall-stones as obstructions may not be detected until
they are passed.The previous occurrence of attacks of hepatic colic,
followed by jaundice, gives rise to the suspicion that gall-stones are
in the intestine if they have been carefully looked for in the stool
but never found.[38] Enteroliths give no indication by which they could
be known to be in the bowel.[Footnote 38: In a case seen by the author three separate attacks of
typhlitis occurred in a young woman suffering from chronic
constipation.After the last attack she passed from the bowel several
dark, irregularly-shaped concretions.The largest of these was a
gall-stone covered with fecal matter.Since this time--two years
ago--there has been no recurrence of inflammation and the constipation
is much better.]All forms of constipation from organic modification of the walls grow
worse and have no remissions; some rapidly progress toward a fatal
termination.Simple constipation is subject to improvement and relapses
due to the character of the food, climate, exercise, etc.Stercoral tumors may be known by their position and character as {650}
ascertained by physical examinations and by their history.They are
found in the iliac, lumbar, or hypochondric regions, and sometimes in
other parts of the abdomen.The most common seat is in the sigmoid
flexure and descending colon.They are nodulated, movable, painless,
can be made to change shape or are indented by pressure, and have a
doughy feel.Exploration of the rectum, by detecting impaction, will
make the diagnosis clear when the obstruction is low down.The
distension of the abdomen above the point of obstruction is limited at
first to the region of the colon; but if the colon is much dilated with
gas or is displaced, the enlargement becomes more central and more
general.On percussion the sound is of a dull tympanitic quality, and
never absolutely dull even in cases of great fecal accumulation.[39]

[Footnote 39: Case referred to by Guttmann (_Physical Diagnosis_,
Sydenham ed., p.360), in which the sound was dull tympanitic over two
large fecal tumors which weighed when removed at the post-mortem six
kilogrammes (sixteen pounds).]Fecal tumors[40] are preceded by habitual constipation, and are most
common in elderly people; they are changed in position and size or made
to disappear by cathartics or rectal injections.Persistent treatment
will bring away scybalae which by their color and consistence show that
they have long been in the canal.But the free movement of the bowels
and the non-disappearance of the tumors are no proof that they are not
fecal.[Footnote 40: _Tumeurs stercorales_, Paris, Thesis No.Fecal accumulations have been mistaken for ovarian tumors,[41]
cancerous tumors of the mesentery, uterine fibroids, and retro-uterine
haematocele.Fecal tumors in the transverse colon have been taken for
enlargement of the liver and spleen.In one instance obstruction of the
bowel from fecal impaction was supposed to be a strangulated gut in a
patient suffering from hernia: an operation was performed, the patient
dying in sixteen hours afterward.[42] Ovarian tumors in their early
stages are sometimes thought to be fecal.[43]

[Footnote 41: Jas.Times and Gazette_, London, 1859,
vol.[Footnote 42: Thomas Bryant, _Med.[Footnote 43: J. B. Brown, _Lancet_, London, 1850, vol.Fecal impaction in the rectum, with ulceration and bloody and mucous
stools, may for a time be called cancerous ulceration.Sacculated
scybalae cannot be distinguished from submucous tumors even by the hand
pressing on them in the rectum.[44]

[Footnote 44: H. R. Storer, _Gynaecological Journ._, 1869, vol.The history of each individual case, a full knowledge of etiological
factors, and a careful physical examination will in most instances lead
to a proper diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The result of treatment depends upon the age.Although in
infancy constipation is very common, cure is the usual result where a
mixed diet begins to be taken in childhood.At from one to fourteen
years of age regular movements can usually be secured, unless there is
a radical defect in the organization of the child.In young girls at
puberty and after, if constipation once is established it is apt to
become inveterate, associated as it is with imperfect development and
with uterine displacements.In middle life in men the result depends
upon the cause and upon attention to the physician's counsel.If
intestinal catarrh or atony is the cause, a persistent subordination of
the life of the individual to the object in view will generally end in
cure.In women who have borne {651} children the hope of relief depends
upon the duration of the malady before treatment.It is a dispiriting
task to attack a constipation of many years' standing in women with
relaxed abdomens, uterine prolapsus or retroversion, and general
debility.In old age the causes are generally such as cannot be
removed.The bowels can be moved when the occasions demand, but there
is very little expectation of establishing a spontaneous habit of
regular fecal movements.At every age and from whatever cause perseverance and hope on the part
of the patient and doctor are the chief elements of success.In
neglected cases the worst results may happen: dilatation of the colon,
ulceration, fecal impaction and obstruction, perforation; or in milder
cases chronic indigestion, hypochondria, etc.TREATMENT.--The physician can render great service by giving to parents
advice which will prevent constipation in children.He should insist
upon the importance of habits of regularity in defecation.At the
period of puberty in young girls this is of even greater moment, and no
opportunity should be lost for pointing out the danger of neglect.As a
prophylactic measure in adults counsel should be given suited to the
occupation.To persons leading sedentary lives the necessity of
exercise ought to be made clear.In the trades little can be done, but
in the case of literary men and those who read or write for many hours
prevention is easier than cure.Daily exercise, walking or riding,
frequent bathing with active sponging and friction of the surface,
especially over the abdomen, will be of much service.Avoiding
constrained positions where pressure is brought to bear upon the
abdomen, as in bending forward to write, is quite an important item.Among ignorant people advice of this kind is rarely attended to, but
even here the doctrine of regularity should never cease to be preached.Active business-men, especially young men, need emphatic teaching.They
cannot plead ignorance for the habitual and persistent neglect of the
simplest rules of health of which they are in this country so often
guilty.The symptoms of indigestion which are precursors of
constipation should receive due attention, and a mode of life and
dietary suited to a complete digestion of the food will favor the
timely and proper expulsion of waste matter.Acute constipation in a previously healthy person, lasting for one to
three days, does better without interference.No harm attends temporary
inaction of the bowel, and if a spontaneous stool takes place at the
end of this time it is a sign of a healthful and vigorous condition.The habitual clearing out
of the bowel by a purgative pill or dose of mineral water whenever such
a state of matters occurs creates the necessity for the interference.The man who never lets himself go over a day without an action is
miserable if he misses his purgative and its effects.In the onset of acute diseases the custom of giving a preliminary
purgative is generally unnecessary, often injurious.It disturbs the
rest which such cases need; it produces exhaustion in some diseases, as
pneumonia, pleurisy, and rheumatism; it irritates the mucous membrane
when irritation involves danger, as in intestinal catarrh and typhoid
fever.When it is desirable to empty the bowel in acute constipation a
warm-water enema for adults and children is the best means.When a
laxative is necessary in case of a failure of the enema, one mild in
its operation {652} should be chosen--a compound rhubarb pill, one to
five grains of calomel, a teaspoonful of Rochelle salts, or half a
bottle to a bottle of the solution of the citrate of magnesia or the
tartro-citrate of sodium.For children calomel, in doses of one-third
of a grain to one grain, is one of the most certain and least
objectionable.One grain of powdered rhubarb can be added to this for a
more active effect.Under such circumstances as a blocking up of the bowel with a mass of
partially digested or undigested food, fruit-stones, skins, or other
foreign bodies, where the symptoms are violent pain, tympanites, and
vomiting, the best method is to give large enemata of warm water
through a long rectal tube passed as high up as possible, and to
administer calomel in doses of one to three grains, repeated every two
to three hours until the bowels are moved.Cold can be applied to the
abdomen to diminish tympanites and prevent inflammation.Should the
constipation not yield and the pain, vomiting, and tympanites augment,
the case will then be considered one of intestinal obstruction, and be
treated as such.When called upon to treat chronic constipation, the physician should
remember that it is not the symptom, but its causes, to which he should
direct attention.Constipation is so often a symptom, a complication,
of other diseased states that its management is a matter of secondary
importance.Moreover, its causes are so peculiar to the individual and
depend upon so many variable habits of life that each case asks for
special study.The cure is only to be found by learning the particular
cause--the habit of neglect, hurried eating, the use of aperients,
uterine displacement, or any of the many causes enumerated.The digestion and all that concerns it is of primary importance, and to
it attention should be at once directed.The stomach and intestinal
digestion should be examined separately, and the relative power to
digest different articles of food determined.A diet, then, should be
selected, not with a view to correcting the constipation, but as to its
suitability to the digestive capacity of the patient.No system of diet
can be fixed upon as suited to every case: the aim is to secure normal
digestion and absorption and normal peristalsis.Many trials may have
to be made before a proper dietary can be chosen.When there is
indigestion of fats and malnutrition, with pale offensive stools
containing much mucus, an exclusive nitrogenous and easily digestible
diet--such as is advised in the article on INTESTINAL
INDIGESTION--should be prescribed.In constipation connected with
membranous enteritis a similar system of diet is proper.The drugs
given should be those which aid intestinal digestion, and reference
must be made again to this subject, already treated of.Many cases of
constipation can only be cured by this treatment; the routine treatment
by purgatives and a diet of vegetables and fruits would aggravate and
not relieve.A course of exclusive milk or skim-milk diet, if
persevered in for some weeks, will cure cases of constipation of this
kind without the use of laxatives.Of course a purgative must sometimes
be given if enemata fail, but the least irritating one should be
selected.The mineral waters best suited to constipation depending upon
intestinal catarrh are in this country those of the Rockbridge Alum
Springs and Capon Springs (Va.), the California Seltzer Springs, and
the milder {653} waters of Saratoga.The most suitable from Europe are
the waters of Apollinaris, Vichy, Buda, Vals, Ems, Salzbrunn, Selters,
Mt.The warm baths of Virginia (Warm Springs, Hot
Springs) are useful in increasing the activity of the skin and in
giving relief to the catarrhal state.A month spent at the Warm
Springs, with a daily bath the natural heat of which is 98 degrees,
will work a complete transformation in the abdominal circulation.This
should be conjoined, of course, with a properly-regulated diet and
exercise.Another month spent at the Rockbridge Alum Springs will
complete the restoration of the bowel to a normal state.It is much to
be regretted that the really valuable mineral springs of Virginia lack
so many of the comforts which the invalid requires.In cases where it
is more convenient a stay at the Arkansas Hot Springs is to be
suggested, and for obstinate cases of intestinal catarrh with sluggish
circulation, obesity, and gouty tendencies these springs are to be
preferred.A season at some of the mineral baths of Europe, as
Aix-la-Chapelle, followed by the strict regimen of the grape cure (as
at Bingen, Durkheim, Vevay, Montreux, or Meran), is a rational mode of
treatment which offers an almost certain prospect of cure.If the case is one of atony of the colon due to impaction of the rectum
and dilatation of the rectum and colon, without gastric or intestinal
indigestion, a quite different regimen is required.The constitution
and mode of life are the guides to the general plan to be followed.Sedentary pursuits are to be given up as far as possible.Long
vacations and travel must be insisted on, with active exercise by
walking and riding; also cold bathing or sponging, with brisk friction
of the whole body.Sea-bathing is useful both as an exercise and for
the effect upon the sluggish peripheral circulation, but the slothful
life at the seashore, with over-indulgence in eating and drinking, is a
source of more harm than good.Warm baths, and cold douches to the
abdomen, compresses of cold water or of alcohol, the cold douche to the
spine while in the hot bath, are all beneficial.Massage for women,
children, and feeble persons takes the place of exercise.The kneading
of the muscles over the abdomen can be combined advantageously with an
effort to accelerate the passage of the contents of the colon by
manipulation in the direction of movement.The interrupted electrical current, used for the purpose of developing
the feeble abdominal muscles, is a source of much advantage.[45] But to
be of service it should be persevered in for months, the patient
himself making the application under the direction of the physician.In
addition, the introduction of one insulated electrode into the rectum,
while the other is in contact with the abdominal muscles or along the
line of the large intestine, has been advised.The Swedish movement
cure may be a useful aid in some cases.The movements exercise the
muscles of expulsion.These are deep inspiration, flexion and extension
of thighs or trunk, twisting the trunk, pressure on the abdomen and
colon, stroking in the direction of fecal movement.[Footnote 45: S. T. Stern, "Die faradische Behandlung der Obstipation
und der nervosen Enteropathie," _Centralblatt fur Newenheil_, 5 Jahrg.,
Mai, 1882, p.201; also, I. Althaus, "Treatment of Obstinate
Constipation by Faradization of the Bowel," _Lancet_, London, 1867, ii.In the relaxed condition of the abdomen in women who have borne {654}
children or in old persons the wearing of an abdominal support
sometimes gives help and comfort.The best diet for cases of atony of the colon and rectum is one which
is easily digested and has a moderate amount of waste, as a full colon
will stimulate muscular action.Various articles are suggested with a
view to excite peristalsis by irritation of the mucous surface, but as
such substances are in themselves insoluble and innutritious, it is
unwise to resort to them.The following list includes the foods
suitable to such cases: Fresh vegetables, as spinach, raw or stewed
tomatoes, lettuce, kale, salsify, peas, asparagus, kohlrabi, and other
summer vegetables; in winter canned vegetables, if well prepared, take
their place.Among fruits, fresh fruit in general, especially grapes,
peaches, and oranges; dried fruit, as figs, raisins in small quantity,
stewed prunes, and baked or stewed apples, can be tried.Too much vegetable matter is harmful, as the bowel is filled with an
excess of waste, much of which is undigested food; the quantity must be
regulated by the appearance of the stools and by the success of the
regimen.If the blockade continues obstinately, the vegetable diet
should be reduced.The microscope in many cases can alone decide the
amount of undigested vegetable matter.Meats are all advisable in
moderation.The least digestible, as ham and veal, are to be avoided.Graham-flour bread, brown bread, or bran bread are better than bread
made of the best bolted flour.The first is more digestible, and bran
bread[46] is thought to increase peristalsis, but this is a doubtful
effect.Oatmeal well boiled, fine hominy, corn meal, or cracked wheat
with milk are pleasant and digestible.A cup of cafe au lait at
breakfast or before breakfast is the best morning drink;[47] it has a
laxative influence.Milk at
breakfast answers well for those who take it with relish.An orange on
rising in the morning is a pleasant remedy.[Footnote 46: "The Efficacy of Bran Bread in relieving Despondency...
dependent on an Irregular and Constipated State of the Bowels," _Journ.Sci._, London, 1858-59, v.[Footnote 47: "Treatment by Cafe au Lait," _Gaz.des Medecins prat._,
1840, No.Certain drugs are called for to aid these measures in giving tone
directly or indirectly to the weakened bowel muscles.Strychnia stands
first, but it woefully disappoints one who trusts much in the
theoretical arguments for its use.In fact, it may be said of all drugs
given for constipation that they stand in a very subordinate rank to
the measures already discussed.They should be thought of last, not
first, and but little confidence should be put in the vaunted value of
new drugs.Strychnia can be combined in anaemia and debility with the
dried sulphate or carbonate of iron, and with quinia or arsenic,[48] or
in feeble digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin.Belladonna was advised by Trousseau as a stimulant to unstriped
muscular fibre, and it can well be given with strychnia; ipecacuanha
and atropia are approved of in conjunction.[49] A pill of ergot,
belladonna, and strychnia would answer the indication of a feeble
peristalsis.DaCosta has suggested giving one drop {655} of the fluid
extract of belladonna with compound tincture of gentian or cinchona
three times daily after meals.The sulphate or valerianate of zinc,
oxide of zinc, extract of valerian or gentian, capsicum, or black
pepper can be tried in pill form with belladonna and strychnia.[Footnote 48: Bartholow thinks arsenic overcomes constipation when due
to deficient secretion and dryness of the feces (_Mat.Med._, New York,
1879, p.[Footnote 49: Legros and Onimus, _Journal de l'Anat.et de la Phys._,
t. vi.Ringer says one grain of ipecacuanha taken while
fasting each morning will relieve constipation from torpor
(_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.These remedies are slow-acting, and in the mean while the bowels must
be moved artificially, methodically, and taught to act at stated hours.For this purpose a small enema of cool or cold water at the same hour
every day after breakfast does well.It is irrational to distend the
bowel, already weakened by distension, with large enemata of warm
water.Recourse should not be had to this until all hopes of effecting
a cure are gone, or only as an occasional remedy in impacted
accumulations where the mass must be softened before it can be removed.If the enema does not in time empty the colon sufficiently, laxatives
will have to be taken with some regularity until the habit is created.A tumblerful of water with or without a teaspoonful of salt, or a
tumblerful of any alkaline water charged with carbonic acid, taken on
rising in the morning, may prove effective.A tablespoonful of sweet
oil at night acts well as a lubricator and softens the feces.If these
more simple means fail, it becomes unfortunately necessary to give a
purgative drug: any one of this class can be combined with strychnia,
belladonna, vegetable tonics, and iron.Those to be preferred are
aloes, colocynth,[50] and podophyllin.The compound podophyllin pill or
a pill of one-sixth of a grain of belladonna and podophyllin at night
or three times daily, the pill of aloes and myrrh, or the Lady Webster
pill, are well-approved forms of administration.A compound rhubarb
pill acts well if taken after dinner.[Footnote 50: A few drops of the Prussian tincture of colocynth several
times daily is advised by Ringer (_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.If one desires to select a purgative which will probably increase the
outflow of bile, selection can be made from the following drugs:
podophyllin, aloes, rhubarb, colchicum, euonymin, colocynth, calomel,
jalap, sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate, cream of tartar; and among
the rarer alkaloids iridin, sanguinarin, physostigma, and juglandin.These, according to Rutherford, Vignal, and Dodds, increase the
secretion of bile in fasting animals.Ox-gall and pig-gall are
laxatives only; they have no effect on the liver, but can be added to
other purgatives in pill forms.Salines largely diluted may be given to strong adults: Epsom or
Rochelle salts quite early in the morning, a solution of sulphate of
magnesia with dilute sulphuric acid, to which dried sulphate of iron
may be added, are quite popular; and of the bitter waters, Hunyadi
Janos, Friedrichshall, or Pullna water serves the purpose.One grain of
sulphate of quinia added to a saline will increase its effect.The
milder laxative waters are to be preferred to the bitter waters.The
Saratoga waters, Congress, Geyser, Hathorn, answer the purpose taken
early in the morning, or among the European springs those of Kissengen,
Plombieres, Marienbad, Homburg, Seltzer, or Leamington in England, are
not too active in their effects.In atonic constipation, the form now
under consideration, the laxative chalybeate waters are indicated where
there is anaemia or debility.These are represented by the Columbian,
Pavilion, Eureka, and Excelsior Rock among the Saratoga waters, and by
the Bedford Springs water.{656} It is well to administer a number of drugs in rotation in
habitual constipation, as the susceptibility to a particular drug is
lost after continued use.Increase of the dose is the usual method to
offset this result, but it is irrational to meet exhaustion by
over-stimulation.Rest of the part stimulated by using a remedy which
brings about the result in a different way is the wiser course.The
dose should be gradually reduced, tempting the bowel to act more and
more without aid.Among the laxatives which can be borne in mind in
alternating treatment the following list includes some which can be
used with advantage: the fluid extracts of rhamnus (buckthorn) and
cascara sagrada; alum, which is called for in certain forms of atony;
sulphur in the form of confection or sulphur with guaiacum[51] (half a
drachm of each in powder at night); the wine of colchicum (five drops
or more three times daily), advantageously used in gouty or rheumatic
persons; the infusion or tincture of euonymus; the tincture of benzoin;
senna in fluid extract and in the compound powder of liquorice.[Footnote 51: Fuller, _Lancet_, London, April 23, 1864, p.Infants and children should be cured of constipation without purgatives
if possible.Attention to the diet of the infant, and close inspection
of the stools to see the effect of the food given, will guide to a
proper system of feeding.Breast-milk is the best remedy; next, a food
which most nearly resembles mother's milk--cow's milk properly diluted
with barley-water, oatmeal-water, or rice-water--stands first.Condensed milk, given in barley- or oatmeal-water, is a second and
excellent substitute in cities.Antacids prevent a too rapid
coagulation of the casein and the formation of curdy lumps.Lime-water
with milk or bicarbonate of potassium or of sodium may be administered
with the food or before it.The quantity of food must be lessened until
the child can digest all it takes.The infant should be taught to empty the bowel at the same hour daily
by always placing it at this hour in a position favorable to and
suggestive of defecation.Dilating the sphincter at the same time with
the soap suppository or the small end of a Davidson's syringe, or just
touching the margins of the anus, will excite the necessary reflex
movement.If defecation is painful, examine the inner edge of the anus
for small cracks or for eczema ani.[52] Over-stretching the sphincter
with the finger in cases of rigid or spasmodic contractions will
sometimes produce permanent relief.[Footnote 52: Betz, "Eczematous Proctitis," _Memorabilien_, iv., Dec.In children the question of diet is equally important.Most cases of
constipation in them originate in intestinal catarrh from improper diet
and over-feeding.Strict rules of diet should be rigidly enforced, and
each case receive special study in order to determine upon the best
dietary.The minutest details of the child's life, its habits and
surroundings, are to be controlled so as to secure the best possible
influences for health.Feeble development and muscular inertia must be
remedied by change of climate and tonics--iron, strychnia, and
cod-liver oil.When other methods fail to give early relief, a
purgative may be needed.Rhubarb, magnesia, calomel, Friedrichshall or
Hunyadi water, given in milk, the compound liquorice powder, the
compound anise {657} powder, are better than the more active
cathartics.[53] Habitual administration of laxatives to children ought
to be regarded as a confession that the case is incurable; it is a last
resort, for which necessity is the only argument.[Footnote 53: The compound anise powder, a non-officinal preparation in
use in Washington, is a convenient form of administration: heavy
calcined magnesia, 360 grs.; rhubarb powdered, 180 grs.; oil of anise,
40 minims; stronger alcohol, one fluidrachm.The bicarbonate or fluid
magnesia is also a good preparation.Ringer knows nothing so effectual
in bringing back the proper consistence and yellow color to the motions
of children as podophyllin.Dissolve one grain of the resin in one
drachm of alcohol, and of this give one or two drops on a lump of sugar
twice or three times a day (_op.Bouchut suggests the
same solution, with simple syrup as a menstruum.]In old persons tonics should be combined with the laxatives, as
strychnia, iron, quinia, gentian with aloes, colocynth, rhubarb, or
podophyllin.The rectum should always be examined, as impacted fecal
masses will often be found there.{658}

Cholick Colic, and Pain in the Belly; _Ger._, Das Banchgrimmem, Die
Kolik; _Fr._, La colique.HISTORY.--Colic is described by Hippocrates.[1] He recommended the use
of emetics and gave other sound advice regarding the treatment of the
affection.Galen[2] administered sedatives, as opium and henbane, and
he advised them to be combined with carminatives.Aretaeus[3] speaks of
the pain of colic extending to the back, limbs, and testicles, and also
states that when affecting the sides of the body it may be confounded
with pleurisy, hepatitis, or splenitis.Alexander[4] points out the
differential diagnosis of the disease and directs a proper course of
treatment.Cupping, friction of the extremities, and dry fomentations
were recommended by Celsus;[5] and internally he advocated a mixture of
poppy, anise, pepper, etc.Aetius[6] describes the affection.Serapion[7] and Avicenna[8] treated of colic more clearly than any
previous writers had done, and advised narcotics administered by the
mouth and rectum.Atony of the bowels is given as a cause of the
disease by Haly Abbas,[9] and Alsaharavius adds[10] to the etiology a
hot intemperament, indurated feces, and poisonous medicines.Rhazes[11]
directs the administration of emetics when the colic is due to
indigestion.[Footnote 1: _De Affect._, xv.][Footnote 5: _Medicina_, Libri octo, iv.[Footnote 9: _Pract._, vii.[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, xvii.NATURE AND DEFINITION.--Enteralgia is the name given to intestinal pain
which is independent of indigestion and of inflammation or other
organic change in the wall of the bowel, and corresponds to gastralgia
and other visceral neuralgias.It involves the nerves which pass to the
intestine along the line of attachment of the mesentery, and which are
derived from the superior mesenteric plexus, with a prolongation from
the junction of the right pneumogastric nerve with the coeliac
plexus.[12]

[Footnote 12: The very extensive distribution of terminal
nerve-filaments in the intestine is an explanation of the frequency and
severity of attacks of intestinal pain."We may form some estimate of
the extent to which the nervous system of the intestines is developed
from the fact that about one hundred ganglia belonging to the submucous
and over two thousand to the myenteric plexus are to be found in one
square inch of the intestine of the rabbit" (Frey, _Histology_, New
York, 1875, p.{659} The pain of enteralgia is not spasmodic, and is not accompanied
by flatulence, borborygmi, or other signs of indigestion and gaseous
distension of the bowels.Colic, on the other hand, applies to intestinal pain accompanied by
indigestion, distension of the bowel with gas, or the contact of
irritating ingesta.The pain is spasmodic, and is relieved by the
passage of gas and other contents from the bowel.The pain is due to
the local irritation of the richly-gangliated plexus of nerves seated
in the submucous layer and which extends from the pylorus to the anus.At present enteralgia must be considered from its symptoms and from
post-mortem examinations as a pure neurosis of the sympathetic system.Opportunities are rarely offered for studying the post-mortem
appearances of the disease, from the fact that when idiopathic it
seldom ends fatally.Out of forty-nine autopsies on patients who had
suffered from colic due to lead-poisoning, only one was found with any
change of the abdominal ganglia of the sympathetic.Segoud found the
ganglia and some of the fibres of the sympathetic hypertrophied and
indurated,[13] and "in recent times Kussmaul and Maier have published
an example of sclerosis of the coeliac and superior cervical
ganglia."[14]

[Footnote 13: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 14: M. Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.The pathology of enteralgia due to a vitiated state of the system, a
morbid condition of the tissues of the intestines, the presence of
irritating ingesta, or to reflexion from other organs, differs in no
wise from a neuralgia of other parts arising from constitutional,
local, or reflex causes.Pain will likewise manifest itself here in
consequence of deleterious substances circulating in the blood, as in
Bright's disease, rheumatism, gout, or lead-poisoning.The terminal
nerve-fibres of the intestines are irritated in attacks of colic by
substances or food within the alimentary canal; gases are generated
from the decomposition of the ingesta.The consequent dilatation of the
gut produces loss of tone and abolition of the contractile power of the
muscular coat.Constipation and pain from pressure exercised on the
neighboring nerves will be the result.Obstinate constipation, and even symptoms resembling ileus, may arise
from a portion of the intestine thus distended becoming bent upon
itself, the sharp angular flexure interrupting or completely
obstructing the passage of the feces.[15]

[Footnote 15: F. H. Hamilton, _Med.Gaz._, New York, 1880, vii.ETIOLOGY.--Enteralgia may be either idiopathic or symptomatic.The
causes can best be considered by dividing them into general and reflex.Under the head of general causes may be mentioned an inherited neurotic
temperament, particularly in individuals of a hypochondriacal tendency.Females are far more apt to suffer from this affection than males, on
account of their more impressionable nature and greater liability to
nervous diseases in general.Hereditary tendencies, overtaxing the
mental powers during the developmental period of youth, and later in
life excessive mental labor and anxiety of business affairs, are
causes.It may occur in the cachexia developed during the course of
many chronic diseases, as diarrhoea, rheumatism, gout, phthisis,
cancer, Bright's disease, etc.Various morbid conditions of the blood
are followed by {660} enteralgia, as anaemia arising from prolonged
lactation, masturbation, or venereal excesses, and the presence of
various blood-poisons, as syphilis, malaria, lead, copper, and arsenic.Other causes are living in cold, damp climates, with sudden changes of
temperature and chilling of the body.Persons addicted to the use of
tobacco or alcohol and to dissipations of various kinds may become
predisposed to enteralgia.Enteralgia is often secondary to ovarian, uterine, or other distant
disease.Also, owing to intimate sympathetic relations, pain is often
felt in the bowels as a result of disease situated in some of the solid
abdominal viscera, as the liver, spleen, and pancreas.In the same way,
organic affections of the brain and spinal cord, especially acute
myelitis and spinal sclerosis and lesions of the vertebral bones,
excite intestinal pain.The
application of cold to the feet or catching cold in general is followed
by pain which is due to reflex influence.There may be a predisposition to colic from hereditary influence and
the neurotic temperament.A feeble digestion is a source of constant
risk.Much of the pain occurring in the course of dysentery, catarrh of
the bowel, invagination, fecal impaction, and other structural
affections is of the nature of colic.The most frequent by far of the
local causes is the direct irritation of the terminal nerve-fibrils by
substances within the alimentary canal and by over-distension of the
bowel with contained gas.Some of these irritants are partly-digested
and indigestible articles of food; food taken cold or in excessive
quantity; the decomposition of food and consequent distension of the
bowel by gas.Acid drinks and alcohol have the same effect.Constipation with scybalae may produce colic in an otherwise healthy
person.A morbid state of the intestinal secretions, either as regards
quantity or quality, is said to have a like result, but this is a
doubtful cause.Foreign bodies within the canal, as fruit-stones,
various concretions, worms, and gall-stones if of large size, may
produce pain during their passage through the bowel.Cathartic
medicines may be enumerated as among the local causes, and also various
poisonous drugs.Lesions of any sort seated in the intestinal wall, as
ulcers and neoplasms, induce paroxysmal pains.SYMPTOMS.--The pain of enteralgia occurs in attacks which come on
slowly and continue for a variable time--some hours or days.The pain
is situated about the umbilicus, and is relieved by deep pressure,
although at the same time there may be hyperaesthesia of the skin.The
intensity of suffering ranges from a dull heavy pain to one which is
acute and lancinating.Retraction of the abdomen is common, but there
may be tympanites.No signs of indigestion may appear, but eructations
of tasteless gas, or even borborygmi, may be complained of.The duration of an attack of enteralgia is variable and depends to a
great extent upon the cause.Usually, when the symptoms are severe, the
duration is short.It may pass off in less than an hour, or a
succession of paroxysms continue to recur, and the attack will be kept
up for several days, weeks, or even a month.One seizure predisposes to
another, and each is liable to be more severe than its predecessor.The malady may end gradually or as rapidly as it was ushered in.Attacks are often mitigated, or even terminated, by the occurrence of
some other morbid condition--by a profuse sweat, the discharge of
lochia, {661} the menses, or some secretion which has been checked.The
development of rheumatism or gout may relieve it.Attacks often
terminate with vomiting, belching, and more especially with movements
of the bowels and discharge of flatus.A free emission of pale,
colorless urine is sometimes followed by relief.This occurs in
hysterical cases, and the disease is generally accompanied with some
uterine disorder and with tenderness along the spine.The attack of intestinal colic may be developed suddenly and with full
intensity, or it may be preceded a short time, usually a few hours, and
rarely much longer, by prodromic symptoms.These are nausea, a
sensation of weight in the epigastrium, anorexia, eructations,
tympanites, rumbling, and slight griping pains.The patient is
irritable and restless, his bowels are usually confined, and urination
is often rendered painful by the distended bowels pressing upon the
bladder.These symptoms, which are in truth but a part of the attack, being only
of a lower grade, increase in severity and the pain becomes more acute
and distinctly paroxysmal.It is of a sharp cutting, twisting, or most
frequently griping character, and is in the earlier part of the attack
usually referred to the umbilicus or to one of the iliac fossae, and
sometimes radiating thence in different directions.Generally it
becomes concentrated about the umbilicus.The exacerbations of pain
vary in degree of severity, in duration, and in frequency of
recurrence, while the intervals may afford complete relief or merely a
remission of the acute suffering.The sufferer either lies quietly upon
his abdomen or upon one side or the other, with his body bent forward
and thighs flexed, or he is restless and writhes in pain, groaning and
crying out from the intensity of suffering.He may seek relief by
trying a variety of positions and by pressure applied with the hands or
some solid object against the abdomen.Anxiety and pain are depicted in
his features.His face and extremities are cool and covered with a
clammy sweat.The pulse is small, hard, and generally slower than
normal.Breathing is sometimes oppressed, as a result of spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal and thoracic muscles.Often the muscles of
the hands, calves of the legs, and the feet are similarly affected.The
tongue is moist and as a rule clean.The bowels are constipated--at
times so much so as to amount to obstruction--or, again, diarrhoea and
tenesmus may be present.Other abdominal symptoms are nausea or vomiting, eructation of gas, and
borborygmi.Micturition is at times urgent and painful, and the
testicles are frequently retracted.The abdomen is occasionally tender, but pressure generally affords
relief.It is distended with gas, especially over the large bowel.Palpation often reveals lumps or knots situated within the abdominal
walls and due to spasmodic contraction of its muscles, particularly of
the recti.In thin persons the constricted and dilated coils of the
intestines can also be distinguished as nodular masses which rapidly
alter in shape and position.The severity of attacks of colic varies from a few slight griping pains
felt at intervals to a seizure of such intensity that the patient
suffers agony and presents symptoms of an alarming nature.Fortunately,
these grave cases are comparatively seldom observed.In them the local
and general symptoms are aggravated.Pain is more intense and {662}
constant, having less marked intervals of relief, and the patient may
pass into collapse, with a small, rapid, and wavering pulse, restricted
respiration, shivering and chilliness, and a cool, clammy skin.The
abdomen is greatly distended; hiccough comes on, also stercoraceous
vomiting, tenesmus, and in the worst cases involuntary stools and
suppression of urine.Nervous symptoms have been observed, as dizziness
or fainting, and finally delirium and convulsions may end the scene.VARIETIES.--Attention has been called to a distinct form of enteralgia
due to the effects of alcohol.[16] It affects steady drinkers, and is,
as a rule, met with only during the hot months.The presence of
undigested food within the alimentary canal or exposure to cold may act
as exciting causes of the disease.Dull pains, felt at first over the abdomen, become later more
continuous and fixed about the epigastrium or umbilicus.Sometimes they
are complained of more over the bladder.Bilious vomiting and hiccough
are prominent symptoms; the patient is thirsty, and the liquids taken
only promote vomiting; and the bowels are constipated.There is
restlessness, and sleep is obtained with difficulty.Paralysis at times
supervenes, and affects the lower as well as upper extremities.In the
worst cases delirium and even convulsions occur.The disease nearly
always ends in recovery in from three to ten days.Severe intestinal
and gastric pain occurs in opium-eaters, but especially in women who
use morphia in excess.The suffering is always greater when the opiate
is reduced, but can only be cured by breaking up the bad habit.[Footnote 16: Colica bacchanalium, J. H. Claiborne, _Med.Monthly_, New
York, 1855, p.A variety of colic which occurs epidemically[17] in some of the
inter-tropical countries has been studied and described by different
observers.It is known by various names, such as colique seche; colique
vegetale; rachialgie vegetal; colic of Poitou, of Devonshire, of
Madrid, of Java, of Surinam; colique nerveuse; endemique des Pays
Chauds (Fonssagrives); endemic colic, dry colic, bilious colic, nervous
colic; girafy; dandy, etc.Segoud called it a neurosis of the great
sympathetic, and attributed the disease to the effect of cold.[18] The
symptoms resemble, in many respects, those of lead colic, and at one
time they were erroneously considered identical with it.[19] Thompson
and Chisholm,[20] after an {663} experience with the disease in the
West Indies, assert that such is not the case.Epidemics which occurred
in Madrid and several of the Spanish provinces, and many hundred cases
witnessed among the French soldiers by other observers, were
ascertained not to be due to lead-poisoning.[Footnote 17: Colique vegetale, or endemic and epidemic colic, did not
escape the notice of the older writers.It is mentioned by Aretaeus;
Paulus AEgineta describes an epidemic of the disease which extended
through Italy and a large part of the Roman empire, and he states that
attacks were often followed by paralysis.Francois Citois gives an
account of an epidemic which raged at Poitou in 1616.Monson Smith
described the disease in 1717.In 1724 it appeared in Devonshire,
England, and presented the characteristic symptoms and sequelae.In
more recent times epidemics of the disease have occurred in nearly all
the countries of Europe.It prevailed in the northern part of France
and in Belgium from 1853 to 1859, inclusive.It has likewise visited
the Caribbee Isles, Cayenne, Guadaloupe, Madagascar, India, the West
Indies, some of the provinces of Spain, Java, the west coast of Africa,
the Antilles, Senegal, New Zealand, Brazil, and various other
localities.The disease occurs in all seasons, but is more prevalent in
summer and in the commencement of autumn.][Footnote 18: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 19: The disease frequently appeared on board of French
war-vessels, and was regarded by Lefevre (_Recherches sur les Causes de
la Colique seche_) as due to lead-poisoning.He asserts that lead is
more used in French ships than in those of other nations, and accounts
for its being epidemic in tropical countries because a warm climate
aids in developing the affection, and because there men drink more
freely of water.(See also Dutrouleau, _Arch.gen._, 1855, "Mal des
Europeens dans les Pays Chauds.")][Footnote 20: Quoted by Oppolzer, _Wien.The affection is not accompanied with any constant lesion.Pascal[21]
made post-mortem examinations in six cases and found the mucous
membrane of the duodenum a little reddened: the gall-bladder contained
thick bile, and in a few cases there was congestion of the sympathetic
ganglia.The attack is usually marked by certain prodromic symptoms.The patient complains of malaise, loss of appetite, a load in the
epigastrium, embarras gastrique, dull pains in the colon, borborygmi,
and cramps or tingling in the limbs.For the first few days the bowels
generally move several times daily.The stools are difficult, painful,
and of a black or dark-green color, offensive odor, and accompanied
with the discharge of flatus.As the disease progresses the bowels
become constipated and the discharge of gas ceases.After a few days
the pain is more severe and radiates to the lumbar region, the
testicles, or the thighs.It is seated principally in the epigastrium,
in the line of the transverse colon, or it may involve the whole
abdomen.Movement aggravates the pain, while pressure often relieves
it.The tongue is large, trembling, and coated white or yellow; the
breath is fetid, the saliva viscid, and mouth sticky.Anorexia is
complete; there are hiccough, nausea, vomiting of undigested food and
mucous or bilious matters, and constipation with hard black stools.The abdomen may be distended or
retracted, and micturition is often painful and the urine high-.The pulse is generally slower than in health, but becomes accelerated
when the attack is over.The skin is pale, the conjunctiva often
stained with bile, and in the later stages oedema of the lids and
emaciation come on.The effect upon the nervous system may manifest
itself by amaurosis, deafness, delirium, mania, coma, epileptiform
convulsions, or paralysis.The paralysis affects the extensors of the
hand, arm, and leg, or it may become general and end in death.[Footnote 21: "Recherches anatomico-pathologique sur la Colique dite de
Madrid," _Rec.mil._, Paris, 1826, xix.The duration of the disease is from eight to fifteen days, but in some
cases it becomes chronic.At times
intermittent or remittent symptoms develop, and occasionally the
affection is complicated with enteritis or peritonitis.The prognosis
depends very much upon the character of the epidemic, and the most
serious cases are those accompanied with either cerebral symptoms or
peritonitis.The paralysis sometimes passes off in a few days, but oftener lasts
indefinitely.Emetics, purgatives, and anodynes are recommended in the
treatment of the disease, and frequently a change of climate is
necessary in order to recover fully from the affection.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of enteralgia usually presents some
difficulty even when the symptoms are well marked.That the disease is
a true neuralgia is apparent from the periodical recurrence of the
pain, its sharp and darting character, from the sudden cessation
followed by complete relief, and from the absence of symptoms of
indigestion.Affections bearing a certain resemblance to enteralgia are
to be excluded.In lumbo-abdominal neuralgia the pain is unilateral and extends around
{664} to the back.Tender spots can usually be detected by pressure on
the umbilical or hypogastric regions or on the spinous processes of the
vertebrae.In dermalgia the soreness is superficial, and light pressure
gives more pain than deep compression, while nervous and hysterical
symptoms are constantly associated with this form.Gastralgia is more
frequent than enteralgia, and the pain is located about the ensiform
cartilage.In myalgia of the abdominal parietes pressure causes pain,
as do also movements of the body, coughing, sneezing, etc.Rheumatic
pains would likely be felt in other muscles.In ileus the pain is more
continuous, the tenderness localized; there is constipation of a most
obstinate character, and vomiting of stercoraceous matter.The patient
has an anxious expression and a rapid, feeble pulse.In renal calculus
the pain is situated in the course of the ureter and shoots down to the
pubes and thighs.There is frequent desire to urinate, accompanied by a
scanty discharge of urine, and a copious flow of urine is followed by
cessation of pain.The maximum of pain in hepatic colic is situated in
the right hypochondrium, and is often reflected into the shoulder of
the same side.Colic arising from
lead-poisoning is usually associated with sufficiently characteristic
symptoms to render the diagnosis easy.When syphilitic the pain is apt
to be most severe at night.In catarrh of the bowel the skin is hot and dry, the pulse accelerated,
and other indications of a symptomatic fever are presented.The pain is
more constant, more localized, and pressure causes it to be increased.Tenderness on pressure is not invariably met with, but the rule holds
good that when deep pressure increases the pain inflammation rather
than enteralgia is indicated.If colic is due to indigestible food, a sensation of weight will be
complained of at the epigastrium, griping pains occur at short
intervals, with flatulence, vomiting, and later diarrhoea.If the
attack be wind colic, the abdomen is enlarged by tympanitic distension;
borborygmi and belching occur.If it is the result of accumulation of
feces, there would be a previous history of constipation, and the lump
of feculent matter can be located by palpation and percussion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of idiopathic enteralgia is favorable, the
disease generally terminating after a variable period.Attacks are very
apt to recur, and each one will, in all probability, prove more severe
than the preceding.In symptomatic enteralgia the prognosis will depend
upon the nature of the fundamental disease.Colic terminates favorably in nearly every case.Death has rarely
occurred from complications, as convulsions, and rupture of the bowel
has been observed from great distension.TREATMENT.--If attacks of enteralgia are associated with hysterical
symptoms, it would be proper to employ antispasmodic sedatives.The
compound spirit of ether is very useful in these cases, especially if
they are accompanied with flatulence.Rubbing the spine with
stimulating or anodyne liniments frequently promises well.The
hypodermic dose of morphia gives relief more quickly than can be got in
any other way, but in pure enteralgia with frequently recurring
paroxysms care must be taken not to create the demand for the remedy by
giving it often.The radical cure of the disease is a more important
matter than the treatment of the acute attacks.{665} If the cause of enteralgia be located in some of the solid
viscera or in the nervous system, remedies should be addressed to these
parts, and the reflex nervous impressions allayed by the bromides or
other nervous sedatives.The valerianate of zinc in doses of one grain
three or four times a day is extremely useful in neuralgia from reflex
irritation of the female pelvic organs.Constitutional remedies are
indicated in the cases due to a morbid condition of the blood--iodide
of potassium and mercury if a syphilitic poison or if of a rheumatic or
plumbic origin; colchicum if gouty; quinia if malarial; and iron when
an anaemic state is presented.H. C. Wood states that alum is used with
success; being of service when there is no lead in the primae viae, it
must act in some other way than as a chemical antidote.Arsenic is very
highly recommended in idiopathic enteralgia.Excellent results have
been reported from the use of nitrate of silver,[22] hydrocyanic acid,
belladonna,[23] and iodoform.Change of climate and travel may have to
be resorted to in obstinate cases.[Footnote 22: Nauman, _Deutsche Klinik_, Bd.[Footnote 23: _Lancet_, vol.The objects of treatment in colic are to relieve suffering and
terminate the attack as soon as possible.For this purpose the various
anodyne and antispasmodic remedies, as opium, hyoscyamus, chloral,
ether, chloroform, Indian hemp, and camphor, may be employed.Carminatives are most useful, alone or combined with anodynes and
cathartics.Oleum cajuputi often affords immediate relief.Warm teas of
chamomile, ginger, valerian, or peppermint sometimes do good.When the
suffering is very acute nothing acts so promptly as a hypodermic
injection of morphia, either alone or combined with atropia.The surface of the body should be kept warm, and hot applications to
the abdomen assist in relieving pain.The heat may be conveniently
applied by means of poultices, hot salt- or sand-bags, or rubber
bottles filled with hot water.Cold,[24] used externally, is more
grateful in some cases, and is preferable if there be much tympanites.Sinapisms, turpentine stupes, and stimulating and rubefacient liniments
answer well in some cases, and should be tried.Anodyne applications to
the spine occasionally do good, and cold, applied by means of the
spinal ice-bag, is recommended by Ringer.[Footnote 24: Roux, _Journal de Medecine_, Paris, 1765, p.In order to treat the disease successfully and bring the attack to an
end, its cause should be ascertained if possible, and remedies directed
to its removal.If it be the result of indigestion, the contents of the
stomach should be removed by emetics.Drastic or powerful cathartics
will only tend to aggravate the disease, and on that account mild
laxatives are to be preferred in all cases.Castor oil, calomel, pil.In flatulent colic means should be directed to expel the gas.Anodynes--preferably chloroform--and carminatives should be
administered by the mouth, and enemata containing turpentine or
asafoetida injected into the rectum.In severe cases a clyster with ten
or fifteen drops of liquor ammoniae is said to do good.If distension
of the bowel be so great as to threaten rupture, it may with propriety
and safety be relieved by puncturing the colon with an exploring-needle
or a fine trocar.In cases of flatulent colic where the gas arises from
the decomposition of food {666} remedies to check fermentation, such as
alkalies, creasote, carbolic acid, or the sulphites, would be
indicated.Good sometimes results from pressure and massage of the
abdomen.Rubbing with etherized oils and electricity have also been
used successfully.If the attack be from fecal impaction, it may be
possible to liquefy and remove the mass by using saline cathartics, as
sulphate of magnesium, aided by large oily or mucilaginous clysters,
which in obstinate cases should be injected through a flexible rubber
tube passed up the rectum as far as possible.Injections of an infusion
of tobacco are now seldom used for this purpose, on account of the
dangerous symptoms which often supervene.If pain or tenderness be
present at the seat of impaction, cathartics should be used very
cautiously or not at all, and opium given instead.The administration
of this drug, by relieving pain and allaying spasmodic action, is often
followed by free catharsis.Persons subject to attacks of colic may diminish the intensity, or even
prevent the recurrence, of the disease by employing during the
intervals such remedies as would be indicated in their individual
cases.Phosphate of sodium has been highly recommended for preventing
the recurrence of attacks of colic.R. N. Taylor states[25] that his
experience with the use of the drug is quite extensive, and he found
the treatment uniformly successful.Thirty grains dissolved in a
glassful of water may be taken three times a day--preferably before
meals--and this quantity should be reduced if it causes any irritation
of the stomach.The bowels should be regulated and strict attention
given to diet.A milk diet is of course best in obstinate cases.Any
article of food known to disagree must be excluded, and tea, coffee,
and alcoholic drinks should also be prohibited.Herald_, Louisville, 1880-81, ii.{667}

ACUTE INTESTINAL CATARRH (DUODENITIS, JEJUNITIS, ILEITIS, COLITIS,
PROCTITIS).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enteritis, Catarrhal enteritis, Mucous enteritis,
Endo-enteritis, Ileo-colitis, Entero-colitis, Diarrhoea.Older
synonyms: Chordapsus, Cauma enteritis, Enterophlogia, Enterophlogosis,
Colica acuta seu inflammatoria, Ileus inflammatorius, Enteralgia
inflammatoria, Febris intestinorum seu Iliaca inflammatoria, Colique
inflammatoire.HISTORY.--It is interesting to start at the fountain-head of the two
streams of inquiry--the clinical and the anatomical--and to follow each
in its widely-diverging wanderings until they unite to give to the
phenomena of intestinal inflammation a just interpretation.The symptom diarrhoea was fully described by the earliest writers in
medicine.[1] The symptomatic differences between diarrhoea, dysentery,
and lientery and the different forms of diarrhoea (bilious, watery,
etc.)were given in detail by the Greek and Roman physicians.The
Arabians had a much more elaborate classification of the fluxes.Avicenna made seven varieties of simple diarrhoea.European writers
followed closely in these footsteps.Sennert made twelve and Sauvages
twenty-one varieties of diarrhoea, depending upon as many different
causes, as undigested food, worms, the bile, etc.Many recent writers
have adhered closely to the older authors in their method of treating
of diarrhoea, regarding it as a disease and dividing it into varieties
based on the causes or on the appearances of the stools.Among them may
be mentioned Cullen (1789), Good (1825), Tweedie (1841), G. B. Wood
(1852), Trousseau (1865), and Habershon (1879).[Footnote 1: J. J. Woodward, _Med.of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, foot-note, p.273 _et seq._]

It was only after many years of laborious investigation that the
appropriate lesion was affixed to a symptom so well understood and
described in its clinical aspects.The first conception of abdominal
and intestinal inflammation had no relation to diarrhoea.Under the
name [Greek: eileos], Hippocrates described abdominal symptoms of
intestinal obstruction and inflammation.For Sennert (1641)
inflammation of the intestines meant peritonitis.Bonet (1679), Hoffman
(1710), and Boerhaave (1758) included under this head peritonitis,
ileus, and all febrile and painful abdominal affections.Sauvages
(1763) and Morgagni (1779) gave in detail the symptoms of peritonitis
and called the disease intestinal inflammation--enteritis.In 1784,
Cullen made an advance in subdividing {668} enteritis into e.
phlegmonodoea and e. erythematica--the one involving the entire wall of
the intestine and the peritoneum, the other the mucous membrane lining
the intestine.John Hunter (1794) first fixed the place of peritonitis
as a distinct affection from inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
intestines.[2]

[Footnote 2: J. Hunter, _A Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation, and
Gun-shot Wounds_, London, 1794, p.Up to this time constipation was the chief symptom of enteritis.The
meeting of the streams, the affixing the symptom diarrhoea to its
appropriate lesion, was brought about hypothetically at first by J.
Carmichael Smith in these words: "I think it is probable (for we can
have no positive evidence of the fact) that in diarrhoeas from catching
cold the villous or interior coat of the stomach is sometimes slightly
inflamed."[3]

[Footnote 3: Paper read Jan.On the Continent enteritis soon after this was limited in its meaning
by Pinel (1798) to inflammation of the mucous membrane of any part of
the intestines.He gave the name catarrhal diarrhoea to the same
condition.A still further restriction of its meaning was made by
Broussais (1821), who defined enteritis to be an inflammation of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine; he gave the name colitis to the
same disease in the colon.This distinction was adopted by Rostan
(1826), Andral (1836), C. H. Fuchs (1846), G. B. Wood (1852),
Wunderlich (1856), Grisolle (1865), Flint (1866), and Aitkin (1868).According to the views of some authors, chiefly English, as Copland
(1844), Bristowe (1871), Roberts (1874), Habershon (1879), enteritis
includes inflammation of the serous as well as of the mucous coat of
the intestines.Niemeyer (1864), Jaccoud (1869), Leube (1875), Bartholow (1880), and
most German and French authors prefer the name intestinal catarrh as
applied to inflammation of the mucous coat; inflammation of the serous
coat is peritonitis; the word enteritis is abandoned as involving a
pathological error.NATURE AND CLASSIFICATION.--Catarrh of the intestines is an
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract.There are
various peculiarities of the catarrhal process due to the anatomical
structure of the parts involved, the presence of open glands, lymphatic
follicles, etc.This disease is to be distinguished from inflammation
of the serous coat of the intestine (peritonitis).The two are quite
distinct in their etiology, pathological anatomy, and symptomatology,
although they have been often confounded under the same name,
enteritis.[4] As so much confusion prevails as to the proper meaning of
enteritis, it is best to abandon the word altogether.[Footnote 4: For cases called enteritis in which the lesions of
peritonitis were found, see Hamilton, _Edin.Examiner_, Oct., 1869, p.Diarrhoea is still regarded by some authors (J. J. Woodward) as
synonymous with intestinal catarrh; by others it is considered
separately as a disease distinct from catarrh.Habershon describes the
lesions of catarrhal diarrhoea and mucous enteritis almost in the same
words.[5] It is an unscientific method to take one symptom of a
pathological state, to {669} erect it into a disease, subdividing it
into varieties which are but differences in the intensity of its
manifestation, and to assign to it no fixed lesion.Diarrhoea is in
reality but a sequence and symptom of hyperaemia or inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane.[Footnote 5: Such a method of treating the subject involves a
repetition, with an inversion, of the same description.Thus, catarrhal
diarrhoea has as its lesion mucous enteritis; mucous enteritis has for
its symptom (catarrhal) diarrhoea.]ETIOLOGY.--Intestinal inflammation is more prevalent in the Northern,
Middle, and Western than in the Southern States.There is no relation
between the distribution of malarial and intestinal diseases: in some
regions where malarial disease is rife there is very little disease of
the intestines.Limited areas in Lower Mississippi, Eastern Kentucky,
Eastern North Carolina, etc.have a special predisposition to diseases
of this class.[6]

[Footnote 6: F. A. Walker, _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, table v. p.During the Civil War diarrhoea and dysentery were more frequent and
fatal in the central region than in the Atlantic and Pacific regions.It is difficult to compare the relative liabilibity of the native and
foreign-born populations in the United States to intestinal disease.Inasmuch as children, among whom the bulk of such cases occur, bear
such a small proportion to the adult foreign population, allowing for
differences due to this cause, statistics show that the foreign-born
race has a very distinct predisposition to these forms of disease.[7]
The Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes have a marked susceptibility to
intestinal diseases; the English and Welsh have the same tendency; but
the Irish have a comparative immunity.The <DW52> race is more prone
to intestinal than to malarial diseases in the Middle States, but there
is the reverse susceptibility in the Northern and Southern States.[Footnote 7: The number of children under ten to 1000 native population
is 306; number of children under ten in 1000 foreign population, 47 (F.
A. Walker, "Relations of Race and Nationality to Mortality in the
United States," _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, p.Under ten years more males than females have enteritis, in the
proportion represented by the figures 362 and 299.After ten the
predisposition of the two sexes is about the same.The summer is the season when diarrhoea is most prevalent and most
fatal.June, July, and August are the months in which the greatest
number of cases occur and in which there is the highest mortality.The
extraordinary death-rate in these months in cities is of course due to
the influence of summer heat on children, and the death-rate from
diarrhoea and entero-colitis is chiefly among infants under one year.The highest monthly mortality
from acute diarrhoea among the U.S.troops (white) between 1861 and
1866 was 147, in July, 1862; the next highest was 114, in August, 1862.June and September were after these the most fatal months.According to
the census of 1870, the most fatal month is August.Elevation of temperature in the summer months is the cause of the
prevalence of intestinal catarrh and of its great mortality among
infants and children.The number of deaths bears a direct ratio to the
degree of heat, the highest death-rate occurring in seasons of unusual
high temperature.[8] The effect of excessive or prolonged heat is to
arrest or weaken the digestive processes; undigested masses in the
stomach or the intestines act as foreign bodies and produce
inflammation.[Footnote 8: Among the numerous publications bearing on this subject,
those contained in _The Sanitary Care and Treatment of Children and
their Diseases_ (Boston, 1881) are of especial value.S. C. Busey's
article contains much valuable matter on the relation of summer heat to
illness and mortality among children.]{670} Sudden changes of temperature from cold to heat or from heat to
cold develop diarrhoea.If the air is at the same time saturated with
moisture, the effect of a change in temperature is greatly intensified.In the first hot days of June there is on the Atlantic coast,
especially in cities, a rapid increase in the number of cases of
gastro-intestinal disturbance.A larger number of children are taken
ill in June than in August.The child in time becomes habituated to
heat, and if not attacked early runs less risk of illness in the later
months.A sudden or unusual exposure to low temperature, as in lying on
damp ground, leads to the same result.The check to perspiration after
violent exercise is especially provocative of diarrhoea.In these
instances the congestion and consequent inflammation of the mucous
membrane are brought about through the effect of heat or cold upon the
peripheral nervous system.Cold may act more directly by the driving of
suddenly-cooled blood from the surface of the body to the interior.External burns belong to the same category, as they lead to extensive
inflammation, sometimes to ulceration, of the duodenal mucous membrane
through reflex influence.A case is reported of a boy aged twelve years
who after an external superficial burn of the left thigh was taken with
profuse diarrhoea which ended fatally in three hours (Ziemssen).Contamination of the atmosphere with emanations the result of the
overcrowding of many human beings together, as in prisons, camps, or
asylums, especially where decomposition of organic matter is going on,
is of great influence in causing diarrhoea.Persons living in
badly-ventilated houses, or in houses improperly drained where the air
is vitiated by escaping gas from sewer-pipes, are especially prone to
be attacked.But sewer-gas, per se, does not cause diarrhoea any more
than it causes diphtheria or scarlatina.[9] It is a step backward to
hang upon this ready explanation all our doubts and our ignorance of
the origin of disease.The specific germ of the zymotic diseases may be
conveyed in the gases from sewers, but there are other and more direct
modes of communication which should receive equal attention.Journ._, London, 1880, vol.519) believes that summer diarrhoea has a specific poison which is
intimately connected with the process of putrefaction, and that the
infective material has its source in the public sewers.]Children are much more liable to intestinal inflammation than adults.This is due to the greater susceptibility of the mucous membrane in
them to congestion and catarrh from external influences and from direct
irritation.In infants fed upon an unsuitable diet--cow's milk or other
substitutes for mother's milk--this susceptibility is much increased.The age most liable to attack is under one year, or from the first to
the second year, when, in consequence of dentition, weaning, and a
change from a diet chiefly or almost wholly liquid to one of solids,
there is a great liability to a disturbance of the normal equilibrium.Intestinal catarrh forms almost one-third of the total number of the
affections of childhood.According to the census of 1870, 761 out of
every 1000 deaths from diarrhoea, dysentery, and enteritis occurred
under the tenth year.In old age a similar predisposition exists, and a
mild attack will in old persons induce more serious symptoms than in
middle life.Epidemics of diarrhoea among the aged in asylums and
hospitals are not uncommon.{671} Temperament and idiosyncrasy are causes of differences in
predisposition.Many persons in consequence of taking cold invariably
have diarrhoea, while others as invariably have nasal catarrh or
bronchitis.Certain articles of food, as oysters and eggs, lead always
in some persons to intestinal disturbance.An exaggerated sensibility
of the mucous membrane to particular impressions is the cause of this
peculiarity.Previous attacks of intestinal inflammation render the individual
liable to recurrences from very slight causes.The suppression of the
menses and of hemorrhoidal discharges and the healing of eruptions are
said to be followed by serious diarrhoea, but such an occurrence is
probably more often a coincidence than a result.Sedentary life, by enfeebling muscular movement and by inducing
indigestion and constipation, brings on diarrhoea.Constipation impairs
the muscular tone of the bowel, and hardened fecal accumulations act as
irritants which sometimes provoke acute catarrhal processes--diarrhoea
and dysentery.Insufficient clothing in children and in adults makes
the skin more susceptible to changes of temperature and conduces to
intestinal congestion.Smoking in excess and the use of narcotics and
stimulants are mentioned as debilitating causes which pave the way for
disease in the intestine; the habitual use of the stronger liquors, by
keeping up chronic engorgement of the mucous membrane, is undoubtedly a
potent cause.Occupations which involve deprivation of fresh air and
sunlight, and all trades which enfeeble the individual, make him liable
to all digestive disorders.A feeble constitution, debility from
disease, from over-fatigue, or from loss of sleep, or any perturbing
influence, puts the body in a state favorable to indigestion and
diarrhoea.The eruptive fevers are accompanied more or less by gastro-enteric
catarrh.In scarlet fever, measles, and variola there is a state of
equilibrium between the skin and the intestinal mucous membrane.When
the morbid manifestation does not normally appear upon the skin there
is a transference of irritation to the intestine.The administration of
purgatives in the early periods of scarlet fever and measles delays,
sometimes prevents, the outburst of the eruption on the skin.The
intestinal catarrh of the eruptive fevers has sometimes the
significance of an exanthem and sometimes of a secondary complication.In measles it is more frequently the former; in scarlatina and variola
it comes later as a complication.Uraemia, malarial infection, chronic suppuration, pyaemia and
septicaemia, cancerous and strumous disease of the mesenteric glands,
scurvy, tuberculosis, Bright's disease, and chronic wasting diseases in
general, are conditions in which diarrhoea appears as a result of the
defective nutrition of the vessels of the intestinal wall and their
liability to dilatation and hyperaemia, or from the presence in the
blood of septic matter.[10]

[Footnote 10: For experiments relating to the production of intestinal
catarrh by injections of irritating or putrid matter into the blood
consult _Traite clinique et experimentelle des Fievres dites
essentielles_, Gaspard et Bouillaud; also, _Path.anat._, Lebert, tome
ii., Texte, Paris, 1861, p.The ingestion of a larger quantity of food than the stomach and
intestines are able to soften, and the taking of food essentially
indigestible or improperly prepared by cooking, are causes of the
passage of masses of food more or less unaltered along the intestinal
tract.Hyperaemia {672} follows the mechanical irritation of the mucous
surface.When articles of food are in a partial state of putrefaction,
so that the antiseptic properties of the gastric juice cannot be
quickly enough brought into play, there is a rapid fermentation in the
stomach, with the development of symptoms of gastric and subsequently
of intestinal catarrh.Unripe fruit, vegetables composed of hard
tissue, as early potatoes, cucumbers, pineapples, and cherries, by
their indigestible nature, are frequent causes.Oysters, crabs, fish,
and lobsters often occasion acute diarrhoea in consequence of being in
an unfit condition for food.Cheese has been known to produce violent
illness with symptoms of intense intestinal irritation; these effects
are due to some poisonous substance, hitherto undiscovered, developed
in the course of putrefaction.New coffee causes diarrhoea; six months
is usually the time before coffee grown in Ceylon reaches the European
and American markets; by this time it does not have this effect.[11]

[Footnote 11: J. Stevenson, "Medical Notes from Ceylon," _Edin.Journ._, Feb., 1862, p.The irritant and caustic poisons, as mineral acids, caustic alkalies,
corrosive sublimate, arsenic, oxalic acid, tartar emetic, and carbolic
acid, kindle an intense inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
stomach, duodenum, and of the lower portion of the intestinal canal.Softening of the coats of the intestines from corrosion, with
perforation, is not an infrequent result.Drastic purgatives act as irritant poisons in producing acute
hyperaemia of the mucous coat with excessive transudation of serum; or,
in other words, an acute catarrh.A discharge of vitiated bile or an
excess of bile is given by recent[12] as well as by older writers as a
provoking cause of diarrhoea.The proper relationship is the reverse of
this: an intestinal catarrh the result of irritant action upon the
mucous surface entails a more active outflow of bile, just as some
cathartics by irritating the duodenum excite the gall-bladder to empty
itself.[13] Impacted fecal masses are direct irritants, exciting
inflammation (typhlitis, dysentery); putrefactive changes in
long-retained fecal collections have an additional power of irritation.Foreign bodies accidentally or purposely swallowed, intestinal
parasites, the pus from an abscess which bursts into the intestine,
likewise are excitants of disease.Tubercle nodules, typhoid ulcers,
cancer, or other neoplasms in the wall are surrounded by areas of
inflammation.ed., Philada.,
1880, p.[Footnote 13: "The propositions which are the foundation of the whole
theory that bile can cause diarrhoea, and that its absence leads to
costiveness, cannot be looked upon as proved" (J. Wickham Legg, _On the
Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, New York, 1880, p.Alcohol taken in excess, as in a debauch, leads to acute
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The stomach symptoms are the earliest to
develop and are the most prominent.Habitual alcoholic indulgence is a
more common source of chronic than of acute intestinal catarrh.The influence of unwholesome drinking-water as a cause of diarrhoea has
been carefully examined by Woodward.[14] Turbid or muddy water holding
inorganic matters in suspension, he concludes from the evidence, is not
a source of disease, and the injurious effects of such waters have been
grossly exaggerated.Water containing inorganic substances in solution
produce diarrhoea, and are purgative if the dissolved matters have
purgative properties.Limestone-water may produce {673} temporary
disturbance of the bowels, but is wholesome.Carbonate and sulphate of
lime and magnesium in solution are more cathartic, but not as much so
as selenitic waters which contain an excess of sulphate of lime.The
salts of sodium and potassium in the waters of Colorado, New Mexico,
and Utah are still more liable to produce diarrhoea.History of the War_, Part 2, Medical
Volume, p.599 _et seq._]

Water contaminated with organic matters of vegetable origin, which are
found in states of decomposition in marshes and stagnant pools, does
not, in the opinion of Woodward and Parkes, have very great influence
in the production of diarrhoea or dysentery.Impurities from
decomposition of animal matters are unhealthful.This is especially
true of water impregnated with soakage from privies and sewers; and yet
epidemics of diarrhoea cannot as often be clearly traced to this source
as can outbreaks of typhoid fever.Parkes says water contaminated with
three to ten grains per gallon of putrescent animal matter may be
hurtful.Contusions and injuries of the bowel by sudden pressure or shock to the
abdominal wall may lead to intestinal inflammation.The large intestine
is more exposed from its size and position to such injuries.Pressure
upon the bowel by a tumor, as an enlarged or retroverted uterus, may
cause diarrhoea, the source of which may be overlooked.Early-morning
diarrhoea from a displaced womb is of frequent occurrence.Emotional influence, as sudden fright or grief, will produce sudden
diarrhoea.Lesions of nerve-centres--corona radiata, optic thalamus, or
corpus callosum--induce hyperaemia, softening, and ulceration of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine.[15]

[Footnote 15: Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.Minute organisms (bacteria) are thought by some observers to be the
cause of diarrhoea, especially of a zymotic form, which prevails in the
summer months.In accordance with this theory, the dejecta from
infected persons are the vehicle of the contagious poison which by air-
and water-contamination infects others.[16]

[Footnote 16: Wm.Johnston, _Lancet_, London, 1878, vol.Journ._, London, 1879, p.81; also, G. E. Paget, "On
the Etiology of Zymotic Diarrhoea," _Brit.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--A description of the morbid anatomy of acute
intestinal catarrh includes the changes which are observed (1) in the
exterior appearances of the intestines, (2) in their contents, and (3)
in the condition of their mucous lining.The external appearances of the intestines depend upon the degree of
distension of the tube, the character of the contents, and the presence
or absence of inflammation of the serous coat.Great distension of the
colon, of the caecum, and of the small intestines is met with in acute
intestinal catarrh of some duration, and is due to relaxation of the
muscular coat.The
calibre of the tube may be lessened by strong contraction of the
muscular layer in acute intestinal inflammation of great intensity with
early and fatal termination.The color of the exterior varies with the
tension of the wall, the color of the contents, and the amount of
vascular injection.If the bowel is much distended with gas, the color
is pale; the mingling of bile with the feces causes a yellowish or
brownish color; if blood is in the tube a dull red hue is given to the
walls.If the intestine is congested or inflamed, the vessels are
outlined distinctly and can be seen in {674} different layers.The
areas of external redness generally correspond to internal hyperaemic
patches.The serous membrane shows arborescent congestion at the
mesenteric attachment or is inflamed from perforation; the signs of
peritonitis are most marked in the neighborhood of the
irregularly-shaped, round, oval, or pin-point openings in the gut.The
abdominal cavity may contain fecal matter, food, medicines, or worms
which have passed through the perforation.The intestinal contents, instead of being homogeneous, of
pale-yellow color, and pea-soup-like appearance in the small intestine,
brown and more condensed in the lower part of the large intestine, may
present various changes.The fluid is usually increased in quantity,
and is thinner than normal in the colon: the color is greenish from the
bile, very pale from the closure of the bile-duct, red or black from
blood.The odor is absent from excess of serum, or very offensive from
decomposition due sometimes to the closure of the common bile-duct and
the want of bile.Shreds or masses of mucus may float in the liquid.Undissolved pills or drugs, as bismuth, accumulated seeds, skins of
fruits or vegetables, parasites, or foreign bodies are seen.Epithelial
cells, the debris of digestion, micrococci, and bacteria are visible
under the microscope.Inflammation involving the mucous membrane of the whole intestinal
canal is rarely or never met with.The nearest approach to generalized
catarrh of the bowel is found in eruptive fevers, especially measles.Inflammation extending throughout the whole length of either the small
or large intestine alone, and affecting all parts equally, is also
rare.The ileum is the part of the small intestine most frequently the
seat of disease, but the ileum is rarely affected alone.Inflammation
is more frequently limited to the colon than to the small intestine.The most common form of intestinal inflammation is ileo-colitis, where
the lower part of the ileum and a part of the colon, sometimes of
considerable extent, are inflamed.The duodenum is sometimes the seat
of a local inflammation, but this rarely happens except in the case of
external burns; duodenitis is most frequently an extension of catarrh
from the stomach, but the pathological anatomy of the duodenum presents
some peculiarities which will be described hereafter.(_a_) Hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane may exist without
inflammation.The engorgement of the veins by mechanical retardation in
disease of the liver, heart, or lungs does not constitute catarrh,
although it is sooner or later followed by catarrhal processes, usually
of a chronic nature.Gravitation of blood to the most dependent parts
in cases of long illness distends the vessels, and post-mortem
hypostasis leads to the passage of serum and coloring matter into the
meshes of the mucous and submucous tissue.In fatal cases of acute
diarrhoea sometimes no lesion has been observed.The hyperaemic
membrane pales after death, as does the skin in scarlatina and
erysipelas.[17] The presence or absence of hyperaemia is therefore no
positive proof of the previous existence or non-existence of
inflammation.To constitute inflammation there must be other changes
besides hyperaemia, as oedema, softening, and infiltration with
cell-elements.[Footnote 17: It is difficult to recognize post-mortem hyperaemia in
the mucous membrane of the mouth or throat where intense inflammation
has been seen in life.]{675} A degree of vascular turgescence visible to the naked eye is
nearly always present in the mucous and submucous tissues which have
been the seat of catarrh.It is usually found in the lower part of the
ileum, the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and other parts of the colon.The
redness is diffused over a surface of several feet in length or is
circumscribed in patches of varying size.When vessels of small size
are distended with blood, red branching lines are seen (arborescent or
ramiform injection) which have their starting-point in the insertion of
the mesentery.When the capillary system is engorged a fine interlacing
network can be discovered, which gives to the membrane a more uniform
red color.Parallel lines or bands of redness extend in a transverse
direction across the axis of the canal corresponding to the folds of
mucous membrane in the small and large intestine.The shades of color depend upon the intensity and duration of the
congestion.In acute mild forms the color is light red; in more intense
grades the membrane is more vivid or purplish.Brown and slate-
tints show a passage into the chronic stage.A black hue occurs in
gangrenous inflammation.Minute dots (speckled redness) are due to
minute extravasations, and ecchymotic irregular patches are sometimes
seen.Bile-staining of the mucous surface is met with; this cannot be removed
by washing.In metallic poisoning the redness is more vivid and the
mucous membrane is eroded.[18]

[Footnote 18: For  plates illustrating hyperaemia and
inflammation of the intestines see Carswell, _Path.Anat._, London,
1838, plate ii.These are beautiful representations of
(1) ramiform vascular injection passing into (2) capilliform injection,
which becomes (3) uniformly red, or from its intensity (4) ecchymotic
or hemorrhagic.See also Annesley, _Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1828,
plates x.2), xiii., xxii., xxiv., and xxv.Many of these are
illustrations of peritonitis as a complication of enteritis.See also
Kupferlafelnzer, Lesser, _Ueber die entzundung und Verschwarung der
Schleimhaut des Verdauungskals_, Berlin, 1830, tab.3; also J.
Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1834, figs.116, 118,
124, and 125.These plates are wonderful in their truthfulness and
execution.](_b_) Acute oedema and increase in the cell-elements in the inflamed
parts give rise to swelling and to softening, so that the mucous
membrane seems to be easily scraped off.This is not always the case,
as no loss of firmness of the reddened tissue is often found.In the
small intestine the villi, which in health are not seen, become
enlarged, giving a "plush-like" or velvety appearance to the mucous
membrane; they are sometimes club-shaped from epithelial accumulations
on their free extremities.(_c_) When the small intestine is examined the solitary glands, which
in the normal state are barely visible, are so enlarged that they
appear as rounded prominences.They are described as looking like
grains of mustard-seed on a red ground, and are the size of pinheads.When they are distinctly seen it may be concluded that they are
enlarged.In children the glands are enlarged when there has been
slight or no diarrhoea.Peyer's patches are also tumefied, and are more distinct from being
elevated above the surface, but they have not in intestinal catarrh as
great a relative enlargement when compared with the solitary glands as
in typhoid fever.The interfollicular substance of the patch may
hypertrophy without any increase in the size of the follicles; a
reticulated {676} appearance is then given to the gland.The color of
the swollen follicles in recent inflammation is translucent from
oedema; later they are gray and opaque.These changes are more marked
at the lower end of the ileum, because the isolated follicles and
Peyer's patches are more numerous there.(_d_) Catarrhal ulcers--erosions--are produced by the loss of
epithelium or from a process of vesicle-forming and rupture, as in
stomatitis.They may enlarge, undermine, and coalesce, thus reaching
quite a large size.They may deepen and perforate the wall of the
bowel, causing peritonitis, or they may heal, forming cicatrices which
in contracting may narrow the canal.Small follicular ulcers are found on the mucous surface.They result
from the breaking down of the exposed wall of the closed follicle from
over-distension.The ulcer is either on the apex of the dome of an
isolated follicle or is within the area of a Peyer's patch.Sometimes
several ulcers may be seen on the surface of the swollen patch.[19] The
ulcerative process is sometimes very rapid.In the case of a child aged
eight years, with no previous intestinal disease, who died in the
Children's Hospital, Washington, in June, 1882, after a two days'
illness with watery discharges and rapid prostration, the solitary
glands throughout the ileum were many of them enlarged.As many as a
dozen small ulcers were seen at the apices of the enlarged follicles.[Footnote 19: See photograph facing page 302 of _Med.In the large intestine the same lesions are found, but in a more
advanced stage, especially in the caecum and descending colon.Enlarged
solitary glands of the size of a pinhead or small bird-shot are
scattered along the canal.Follicular ulcers[20] are found in the large intestine, occupying the
summit of the enlarged follicles and involving a large extent of mucous
surface.Pigment-deposits are seen which give rise to the appearances
described as occurring in chronic intestinal catarrh.[Footnote 20: For description of the mode of formation and growth of
follicular ulcers see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.](_e_) The mucous surface is covered, especially in the areas of
redness, with an adhesive, opaque mucus of neutral or alkaline reaction
and of yellow, red, or brown hue, depending upon the relative amount of
bile or blood.It is composed of mucus-corpuscles, epithelium-cells of
cylindrical and prismatic form, pus-cells, and sometimes
blood-corpuscles.Vibrios and bacteria also are seen.The chief distinction between the lesions of acute intestinal catarrh
and typhoid fever are these: In typhoid fever the number of Peyer's
patches involved is larger; there will be a chain of enlarged glands
from the ileo-caecal valve throughout the ileum, those nearest the
ileum being the most altered.Near the valve there is usually some
ulceration, so that the gland acquires a ragged appearance.In catarrh
of the bowel there is a more irregular distribution of enlarged glands;
they project less above the surface, and if ulcerated have one or two
spots of erosion.In typhoid fever the Peyer's patch has the most
prominence.In catarrh of the bowel the solitary glands are the most
enlarged.In catarrh the large intestine may be the seat of the most
advanced lesion; in typhoid fever, except with rare exceptions, the
lesions in the ileum are most advanced.{677} (_f_) The mesenteric glands are enlarged, but not so uniformly so
or to the same extent as in typhoid fever.The stomach is sometimes
found inflamed, the mucous membrane being reddened, thickened, or
softened.The liver, spleen, and kidneys are normal or present
accidental conditions of disease.In the respiratory organs pulmonary
congestion, pleurisy, and pneumonia are found.The heart contains clots
which are fibrinous or soft and red; they are found on both sides, but
when one cavity alone is filled the right is the common seat.The brain
is usually normal; fluid may be in the subarachnoid space, and thrombi
in the cerebral sinuses.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--In the genesis of catarrh of the intestinal
mucous membrane the first effect of the exciting cause is an
over-distension of the capillaries and small vessels; this congestion
is most marked in the meshwork of vessels around the closed follicles.A transudation of serum takes place into the mucous layer, and in more
marked congestion into the submucous layer also; these tissues become
more or less oedematous and swollen.Transudation of serum into the
intestinal tube follows.From over-stretching the walls of minute
vessels may rupture and small extravasations take place, staining the
tissue red.Post-mortem
extravasations are due to decomposition of the wall of the vessel.Rupture of vessels on the surface leads to escape of blood into the
bowel, which is mixed with the transuded serum.The proper secretion,
intestinal juice, is diminished as a result of these changes, but an
excess of the mucus with which the mucous membrane is always coated
immediately follows.The origin of the mucus is not to be sought for in
the activity of the glands alone, but in the transformation of the
protoplasm of the epithelial cells.[21] The varying proportions of
serum, mucus, and blood cause the stools to be serous, mucous, slimy,
or bloody, hence the terms serous, mucous, and bloody diarrhoea.[Footnote 21: Rindfleisch, _Path.Histology_, Sydenham ed., vol.Hypernutrition, swift life of the mucous membrane, the result of
continued excess of blood, entails the increase of the cell-elements.Lymphoid cells accumulate in the submucous layer, especially where
these cells are normally most numerous.There is a saturation of the
membrane with an excess of plasma.Cells also appear in increasing
numbers in the interfibrillary spaces of the mucous membrane, which
increase its bulk, and the follicles of Lieberkuhn appear as if pushed
apart.Lymph-corpuscles accumulate in the meshes of the closed
follicles, which are distended and project above the surface as
described.Multiplication of the cells within the follicle (follicular
suppuration) causes over-stretching and the wall bursts, forming the
first stage of the follicular ulcer.The appearance upon the epithelial
surface of an increased number of loosened cells, which are sometimes
epithelial in character and at other times resembling pus-cells
(epithelial and purulent catarrh), is believed to be due to a rapid
manufacture and exfoliation of epithelial elements, and to constitute
one of the essential features of catarrh.Desquamation of the
epithelium in catarrh of the bowel, even in that of Asiatic cholera,
has been called in question by Woodward, who thinks that the stripping
off of epithelium is cadaveric.SYMPTOMS.--Owing to the difference in the intensity and extent of {678}
the catarrhal process there is every possible variation in the symptoms
of intestinal inflammation.No one symptomatic picture will properly
represent all cases, and with a view to greater convenience and
exactitude of illustration a division may be made into mild and severer
forms.Under the head of mild forms can be included all cases of intestinal
catarrh which by their short duration and benignant character point to
a mild degree of inflammation.They correspond to the following
anatomical states: hyperaemia of the mucous membrane of parts of the
small or large intestine, or of parts of both simultaneously; slight or
moderate swelling of the membrane from serous saturation; transudation
of serum into the canal; increase of lymphoid cells in the mucous and
submucous tissues; and increased manufacture of epithelial cells, but
without any marked tumefaction or ulceration of the closed follicles.The termination is by resolution, which is reached in a few days
usually, and the membrane is rapidly and entirely restored to the
normal state.Between the normal condition of the mucous membrane, with
its recurring periods of physiological hyperaemia, and the hyperaemia
with exaggerated secretion and peristalsis which leads to diarrhoea,
there is no well-defined border-line.Diarrhoea may be regarded as the
most certain sign of the catarrhal process.Whenever the frequency and
fluidity of the stools are such as to be regarded as pathological, some
stage or other of catarrhal inflammation may be assumed to exist.In a large number of mild forms the onset is sudden.After a meal of
indigestible food or an unusual excess pain will be felt in the
abdomen, recurring in paroxysms, which start in the neighborhood of the
umbilicus and radiate throughout the abdomen.The pain is accompanied
by borborygmi, and is succeeded sooner or later by a desire to go to
stool.The first one or two movements, which follow each other in quick
succession, are more or less consistent or moulded, but in a short time
diarrhoea is established by frequent discharges of watery fluid,
containing perhaps some undigested fragments of food, which may have
been the exciting cause of the illness by mechanical irritation.Each
stool is preceded by colics, griping pains in the abdomen, which are
relieved by the evacuation.An attack beginning in this way and from
such causes may cease in a few hours, and be unattended by any general
symptoms if proper precautions are taken.A slight dryness and coating
of the tongue, with loss of appetite and occasional griping pains or a
tendency to looseness of the stools, may continue for a day or two.Indiscretions in diet or other imprudences, as fatigue, may prolong the
mildest attack during one or more weeks, but the character of the
illness is here due not to the nature of the disease, but to the
addition of fresh causes which delay the natural progress toward
recovery.Severer forms either begin suddenly, as in the milder forms just
described, or are preceded for a time by symptoms of gastric or
intestinal indigestion.The patient may have complained of distress
after eating, flatulence, colicky pains, distension of the abdomen and
tenderness on pressure, loss of appetite, with a general feeling of
ill-health--symptoms which point to the existence of a condition of the
mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal canal favorable to the action
of an exciting cause.A feeling of chilliness ushers in the attack.This is accompanied by
fever, which at first, and sometimes throughout, is of a marked
remittent type.{679} The griping pains, colics, which at first are
infrequent and dull, now recur at short intervals and become sharper.They are sometimes attended with vomiting of food or of a greenish
fluid.The intensity of suffering may be so great as to cause pallor of
the countenance, a feeling of faintness, and coldness of the surface
with sweating.The paroxysm usually precedes a movement.The more
severe pains extend to the lower extremities and the scrotum.Movement of gas in the intestines produces rumbling, gurgling, or
splashing sounds, called borborygmi.They are paroxysmal, lasting a few
moments, or are coincident with pain, and frequently are the immediate
precursors of an evacuation.The cause for their production is the
quick propulsion of the fluids by strong peristaltic action from one
part of the bowel to the other or the rapid movement of gas within the
bowel.Relief is obtained both from the pain and from the sense of
distension by expulsion of flatus.Tympanites is closely connected with the symptoms just described.An
excess of gases within the bowel is not primarily a result of the
inflammation of the mucous membrane, but is an early phenomenon due to
the decomposition of indigestible food in its transit through the
intestine.Later, the gases are developed very readily by the
decomposition of even the most digestible articles of food, the mucus,
which is the product of the catarrh, acting as a ferment.The distension of the intestinal canal produces an intumescence of the
abdomen which is commonly uniform, but may be greater in some portions
of the tract than in others.Thus the transverse and descending colon
are more projecting and more distinctly outlined than other portions of
the canal.Sensibility of the abdomen to pressure exists along the line of the
colon or over a considerable area.But no defined limitation of the
affected part can usually be made by the location of pain to the touch.If there is any local tenderness, it is over the descending colon.In
one form of enteritis--typhlitis--the localization of the inflammation
in the caecum produces subjective pain and pain on pressure in a
restricted region--a peculiarity which results no doubt from the early
intensity of the inflammation and the implication of the connective
tissue behind the bowel.But this is not true of inflammation of any
other part of the intestinal canal.A sensation of soreness on movement, as in turning in bed, standing, or
walking, is not uncommon, even when the attack is of no great gravity.The patient on standing bends forward to relieve tension, and he may
feel nervous when the bed is shaken.Diarrhoea is the most important symptom, as it is directly related to
catarrh.The number of evacuations varies from one or two to twenty or
more in the day.In cases of medium intensity there are from six to ten
in twenty-four hours, the interval between the movements being two to
three hours during the day and somewhat longer at night.The matters
passed in quantity range from two ounces to a pint; the average is
about four fluidounces.This, however, is subject to great variations,
depending upon the intensity of the disease; the more choleriform the
attack the greater the amount of fluid passed.The weight of the
evacuations varies from five ounces to forty pounds in twenty-four
hours; this increase does not depend upon the greater quantity of water
only, but the solid constituents are in greater amount.{680} The normal brown color, which is due to hydrobilirubin, changes
as the movements become thinner to yellowish-brown or pale yellow from
dilution of the fecal matter with water.An excess of serum or mucus
renders them colorless.A greenish-brown, greenish-yellow, or green hue
is due to the presence of bile.The rapid descent of the contents of
the bowel delays or prevents the reabsorption of bile,[22] or the fluid
is expelled before the usual transformations in color take place.[23]
The bile-pigment is also absent in duodenal catarrh from closure of the
opening of the ductus choledochus.[Footnote 22: L. Brunton, "On the Action of Purgative Medicines," _The
Practitioner_, London, June, 1874, p.[Footnote 23: The reaction of bile-pigment with nitric acid, which does
not take place in the contents of the colon or in normal feces, is seen
in the green stools of acute intestinal catarrh, especially in
children.]The coloration of the stools further depends upon the character of the
food and drink and upon the drugs given.From an exclusive milk diet
the discharges are pale or contain undigested whitish lumps of casein.The preparations of bismuth and iron give a black color and the
sulphate of copper a dark-green hue.A green or greenish-brown tint is
observed after the use of calomel, and while the experiments of the
Edinburgh committee demonstrated that no increase of bile follows its
administration in dogs, yet the opinion is still general that the green
stools contain an excess of bile.Blood appears in three forms in the stools: as a coffee-ground or black
powder from hemorrhage in the stomach or upper bowel; as a reddish
fluid with small coagula in flakes, which come from intense congestion
or ulceration of the intestine; or an abundant hemorrhage may result
from deep ulceration in the duodenum or elsewhere.The characteristic odor of the feces is altered in several ways.As the
movements become less solid they acquire a nauseous or sour smell, due
essentially to the volatile products formed in connection with the
decomposition of fatty matters.[24] When very thin and containing
little or no feculent matter the discharges lose odor, as in cholera,
or they become excessively offensive--cadaveric--in intense and fatal
inflammation and in ulceration of the bowels.After exposure to the air
the stools of diarrhoea undergo decomposition and develop offensive
smells more rapidly than in health.The absence of bile, whether there
is diarrhoea or not, gives rise to a peculiar and unpleasant odor,
showing that this secretion is to some extent an antiseptic.The escape
of fetid gas from the anus is rarely an accompaniment of a decomposed
state of the rectal contents.In children the stools are more variable
in quantity, color, and odor than in adults, and are more readily
affected by the ingesta.[Footnote 24: Guttmann, _Physical Diagnosis_, Sydenham Soc.The odor of normal feces is due to a substance isolated by
Briequer, called scatol, which is a final product of the putrefaction
of albumen (Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.In the diarrhoea of old persons the discharges are thin, yellow,
offensive, and often frothy.The disorder of the digestive apparatus is attended with other
symptoms.The tongue is normal in some cases; in others red at the
point and edges with a central whitish coat, or the surface is red,
polished, and dry.Marked change in the appearance of the tongue is due
to a complicating gastric catarrh.There is thirst, with loss of
appetite, and a tendency to {681} nausea and vomiting in children and
feeble persons.The breath has a peculiarly offensive odor (spoken of
as fecal) in some instances.In cases of moderate severity it occurs in
the beginning of the illness, but declines rapidly under treatment by
rest and diet.The course of fever does not conform to any type even in
severe cases, although it so nearly resembles that of typhoid fever in
its first week as to lead to mistakes in diagnosis.The height of the
fever and its duration are measures of the extent of the lesions and
their gravity.Sudden outbursts of fever point to some complication.In
catarrh of the bowel due to cold the fever is higher than when
indigestion is the cause.In very feeble persons, in children, and in
any case from neglect and improper feeding the body-heat may be very
high.Very little disturbance of
the nervous system is seen except in young and old patients; some
headache and restlessness are all that may be observed.Moderate
delirium at night accompanies very acute attacks.In children
convulsions are not unusual in the onset and at the end of the attack.In the aged exhaustion from the illness soon lapses into stupor or
coma.Paraplegia and contraction of the muscles of the extremities are
referred by some observers to gastro-intestinal inflammation.[25]

[Footnote 25: Potain, _Le Praticien_, Paris, 1879-80, p.In uncomplicated mild cases of intestinal catarrh there is a movement
toward recovery after a few days' illness.The stools become less
frequent, smaller, and more consistent.In a week to ten days the
tongue cleans, the thirst ceases, the appetite returns, the tympanites
and pain diminish.The fever declines, and ceases before the diarrhoea
is completely arrested.There are always more or less emaciation and
loss of strength from the fever and arrest of nutrition.The liability
to relapse is great, and the patient by indiscretions reproduces the
same symptoms, thus prolonging the attack for several weeks.Acute
intestinal catarrh may pass into the chronic form by a disappearance of
fever and amelioration of all the abdominal symptoms.The patient
begins to take solid food, gains strength and flesh, but complete
recovery does not come.The diarrhoea recurs at variable intervals as
the result of indulgences in a mixed diet, over-exercise, or exposure
to cold, and in time we have some degree of chronic catarrh permanently
established.Very mild cases may be prolonged by the neglect of the patient to
consider his painless diarrhoea of sufficient moment to need attention.In inflammation of the more intense kind the picture is somewhat
different.The prodromes are longer and the general symptoms more
severe.Restlessness, a sense of prostration, delirium, and high fever
mark the early stages and continue for a longer time.The patient loses
flesh and strength quickly.The features express anxiety and illness,
the skin is hot and dry, and the thirst great.Borborygmi, the tension of the abdomen, pain, and sensibility to
pressure are all intensified.The stools are at first yellow and thin,
but change much from day to day.They may be green or very thin and
dark or grayish, and are sometimes very offensive in odor.Blood and
mucus may be seen in them, being slimy or grumous and bloody.When the
patient is very weak the discharges are involuntary; the tongue is
coated white, with bright red tip and edges, and is often dry.{682} The severer forms last from three to six weeks.After a tedious
period of alternate improvement and relapse the illness becomes chronic
or the patient dies from asthenia, perforation and peritonitis, or some
other complication.In the most intense varieties which find examples among Europeans and
Americans in intertropical countries, or result from acute mineral
poisoning and from rapidly-progressing cases of acute ulceration of the
intestinal wall, especially in children, there is a sharper and more
violent invasion.The strength is reduced in a very short time, and
there is rapid emaciation; the features assume an anxious expression;
the complexion is leaden or livid; the skin is cold and clammy; the
pulse is small, weak, and rapid; the breath comes quick and short, and
is frequently complicated with hiccough.In the early stages vomiting
occurs, due to a concurrent gastritis; in cases of poisoning vomiting
is incessant.The pain in the abdomen is intense, and less paroxysmal than in other
forms.The abdomen is tympanitic and excessively tender to the touch,
and the knees are drawn up to relieve the tension of the abdominal
muscles.Thin, black, or reddish stools are passed every few moments.As the attack progresses the urine is suppressed, the voice becomes
whispering, and collapse is developed.This is marked by cold
extremities, dyspnoea, feeble and finally imperceptible pulse.Death
may end the scene in a few hours or the patient may rally and recover
slowly.Choleriform diarrhoea occurs chiefly in children during hot weather.VARIETIES DUE TO SEAT.--The symptoms and progress of acute catarrh of
the intestines present numerous differences depending upon the seat of
the inflammation.The symptomatology already given is that of the most
common form (ileo-colitis), in which the lower part of the ileum and a
considerable portion of the colon are simultaneously involved.Many
cases no doubt occur in which the disease is limited and in which early
recovery is the rule.The pathological anatomy of cases of generalized
catarrh is better known, as they form the bulk of the fatal cases.I. Acute Duodenitis.--The most common form of duodenitis is that in
which the inflammation spreads by continuity of tissue from the stomach
to the duodenum, as in acute gastric catarrh after a debauch.The
prominence of the gastric symptoms disguises the intestinal lesion,
unless the catarrh, as is frequently the case, extends into and
obstructs the common bile-duct and its branches, and suddenly develops
icterus with clayey stools and altered urine.Besides icterus, a
careful isolation of symptoms will show that some cannot be attributed
to the stomach: there is a dull pain seated in the right hypochondrium,
extending to the right shoulder or shoulder-blade, which is increased
by pressure upon the region of the duodenum.As the gastric symptoms
improve there is no change in the icterus, which continues for some
days or weeks longer.The connection between burns of the integument
and ulcer of the duodenum is well known.Symptoms of perforation, with
death, may be the first sign of this lesion, but vomiting of blood,
icterus, purging of blood, indigestion, and cardialgia occur from
duodenal ulcers.The typical acute duodenitis described by authors as an independent
{683} affection is of rare occurrence.An epidemic of duodenitis[26]
has been reported where many persons were simultaneously attacked, all
the cases having had the same traits--headache, pain in the line of the
duodenum at the left edge of the right hypochondrium, pain in the first
and second lumbar vertebrae, constipation, jaundice, slow pulse, and
mental depression.Gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum[27] has been
once seen, and produced a chill, a severe sense of weight and pain in
the epigastrium, retching and eructations of gas, tenderness on
pressure, frequent pulse, and high temperature.There was obstinate
constipation, with dyspnoea, death ensuing in a few days.At the
autopsy gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum was found, which ended
abruptly twelve inches from the pylorus.There was a large gall-stone
in the gall-bladder.[Footnote 26: McGaughey, _Philada.407; also, T. N. Reynolds, _Detroit Clinic_, June 7, 1882, p.[Footnote 27: Eskridge, _Philada.A fatal case of duodenitis is recorded[28] in which the following
symptoms were observed: sudden and severe pain in the right
hypochondrium, increased by pressure; rigors, vomiting and purging of a
green flocculent fluid, and later of blood; jaundice, fever, delirium,
collapse, and death.The pylorus and two-thirds of the duodenal mucous
membrane were much inflamed and the orifice of the bile-duct closed.[Footnote 28: _Die Krankheiten des Duodenums_, Mayer, quoted by Leube
in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Am.Acute Ileitis, Acute Jejunitis.--When the ileum, with or without
the jejunum, is the seat of catarrh, diarrhoea may not be present,
provided the inflammation is slight and there is no increase of colon
peristalsis.The symptoms then are borborygmi, pain and fulness about
and below the umbilicus or between it and the right ileum, especially
after eating, and the general symptoms arising from indigestion and
malnutrition.Fever is slight or absent; there are malaise and loss of
strength.They contain unaltered
bile and fragments of muscular fibre and starch-granules in excess of
the quantity found in health.An increased quantity of mucus, diffused
evenly in a fluid evacuation, or globules of mucus stained with bile,
or bile-stained epithelium, denote inflammation confined to the small
intestine.A larger amount of indican in the urine than is normally
present is a sign of the same lesion.[29]

[Footnote 29: These conclusions are based upon the results of one
thousand examinations of feces made by H. Nothnagel, and reported in
_Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten; Zeitschrift fur klin.Medicin_, iv.,
1882, p.Intense inflammation of the small intestine may exist without diarrhoea
or other symptoms betokening the real nature of the attack.Flint[30]
mentions having met with three such instances, and Goodhart[31] records
thirteen cases of enteritis with marked lesions in which no diagnosis
had been made before death.Rilliet and Barthez report twenty-four
autopsies in children with intestinal lesions in which no symptoms had
been observed.[32]

[Footnote 30: _Clinical Medicine_, Philada., 1879, p.[Footnote 31: _Guy's Hospital Gazette_, Sept., 1878, p.98 _et seq._]

[Footnote 32: _Maladies des Enfants_, Paris, 1861, tome i. p.Acute Colitis.--Fifty years ago colitis was synonymous with
enteritis, and not with dysentery, as at a more recent date.[33] The
older {684} signification expressed the fact that inflammation in the
colon is essential to diarrhoea.Later the term was used synonymously
with dysentery.[34]

[Footnote 33: _Journal general de Medecine_, Paris, 1825, t. xci.[Footnote 34: Tweedie, _System of the Practice of Medicine_, 1841.]The colon is a conducting tube; the contents are composed of matters
unabsorbed in the small intestines.At first the mass entering the
colon is fluid, but by the gradual absorption of its watery part it
approaches solidity.The discharge from the rectum of a fluid shows
that the propulsion through the large intestine is so rapid that the
process of drying does not take place, or that from inflammation of the
colon there is an excess of fluid transudation from the intestinal
wall.The superficial position of the colon, its great size and length,
expose it to the action of external cold, to blows, etc.In catarrh limited to the colon there are essentially the same symptoms
as in ileo-colitis, inasmuch as the inflammation of the colon gives to
that form its characteristic features--borborygmi, diarrhoea, and
tympanites.When the disease in the colon preponderates or exists
alone, the pain and tenderness are more superficial and confined to the
line of the large intestine.The distended colon projects and the
abdominal swelling is not so uniform.If the attack is subacute or
mild, the stools contain normal feces mixed with a great deal of mucus;
when the inflammation is in the sigmoid flexure, pure mucus is passed.Blood mixed with mucus and tenesmus accompany inflammation low down.Blood may, however, come from intense inflammation of the ascending and
transverse colon without disease of the lower bowel.[35]

[Footnote 35: In a case seen by the writer of colitis terminating
fatally from perforation of the transverse colon this point was
illustrated.A woman aged fifty was taken with diarrhoea in August,
1873.In November the symptoms became worse: tongue dry and red;
abdominal pain; tympanites; frequent stools, ten to seventeen in
twenty-four hours; quantity large, of a yellow or brownish-red color
with floating flakes.General symptoms grew worse; blood in stools from
time to time.November 24, sudden cessation of discharges from the
bowels, and the following day sudden collapse and death.Autopsy:
Descending colon and sigmoid flexure comparatively healthy.Transverse
colon adherent to stomach; deposits of lymph on colon and small
intestines; fluid and feces in the peritoneal cavity.The mucous
membrane of the ascending and transverse colon in a state of black
pulpy disintegration.In the transverse colon the walls were thinned by
ulceration and easily torn; gangrenous appearance of mucous coat;
perforation of the colon wall below greater curvature of the stomach.]Proctitis.--The rectum may be the seat of simple catarrh, which
differs in its symptoms from catarrh of other portions of the canal.By
many this form is called simple, non-infective dysentery.But as it is
a form of intestinal catarrh, it is right that it should be considered
in connection with colitis.The first indication of its onset is a
frequent desire to go to stool, with an unsatisfied feeling after each
effort.Normal fecal matter is first expelled in solid form, coated
with mucus which may be streaked with blood.Soon, however, the
discharges consist of jelly-like mucus, alone or mixed with blood.A
small quantity of this is passed with tenesmus at short intervals.The
patient complains of a burning feeling in the rectum and a constant and
irresistible desire to strain.The same spasmodic contraction may
involve the bladder.It usually ends in
recovery spontaneously or under treatment by the cessation of the mucus
and blood and the discharge of normal fecal matter.DIAGNOSIS.--A combination of the symptoms described as belonging to
inflammation of the small and large intestine gives the most common
{685} form of intestinal catarrh, ileo-colitis.This union is diagnosed
by the following symptoms: fever; general distension of the abdomen;
paroxysmal pains starting from the umbilicus, but having a general
distribution; noisy movements of gas; diarrhoea, the stools being
large, thin, stained more or less with bile, containing more or less
mucus intimately mixed with fluid matter and with particles of
partially-digested or unaltered food.It is possible in many cases to
recognize the part of the intestinal canal which is the seat of disease
from differences in symptoms which have already been described.But
great care in observation is needed, combined with a minute inspection
and microscopical examination of the stools, to arrive at accurate and
well-founded conclusions.Acute follicular ulceration may be thought to have begun if after a
week or more of illness thin and sometimes putrescent stools are passed
containing small blood-coagula, with mucus and pus.[36] This opinion
would be confirmed by an increase in abdominal tenderness and the
persistence of the diarrhoea or tendency to relapse notwithstanding
careful treatment and diet.The transition of the disease into the
chronic form would give additional support to this view of the nature
of the lesion.[37]

[Footnote 36: "The intestinal mucous membrane, especially that of the
small intestine, scarcely ever produces pus without ulceration"
(Virchow's _Cellular Pathology_, Philada., 1863, p.[Footnote 37: For a more detailed account of the symptoms and diagnosis
of follicular ulceration see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Some or all of the symptoms of acute intestinal catarrh are, however,
found in other diseases.It is well, therefore, to devote some
attention to differential diagnosis, giving a resume of the salient
points of distinction.Typhoid fever in many of its features resembles intestinal catarrh, and
in many cases is confounded with it.Until within quite recent times
the symptoms of typhoid fever were grouped under the names
gastro-enteritis and follicular enteritis.In the first week of the
illness there is reasonable ground for delay in making a positive
diagnosis.Etiological data are here of great help.The occurrence of
the symptoms in children under two years and in adults beyond fifty
years points strongly to intestinal catarrh.Spring and early summer
are the seasons for diarrhoea; typhoid belongs to late summer and to
autumn.A sudden onset after errors in diet or exposure to cold, with
the early development of pain in the bowels, rumbling of gas,
diarrhoea, would be easily recognized as a local disorder.In typhoid
fever there is a less sudden onset, with prodromal debility, anaemia,
indigestion, and nocturnal fever.To these symptoms the diarrhoea,
which is attended with little or no pain, plays a very subordinate
part.In many cases of mild typhoid the development is sudden, with
rigors.A week's study of the temperature, if no rose-spots appear,
will be needed before the diagnosis can be made.There is not much
difficulty in making the distinction when the attack has reached its
second week.At this period in catarrh of the bowel the high fever,
with regular morning remissions and evening exacerbations, is not
constant, as in typhoid fever; there is tenderness on pressure over the
abdomen and gurgling, but no great meteorism; sibilant rales are not
heard in the chest; there are no rose-spots; rarely cerebral symptoms
except insomnia; and delirium is uncommon.The prostration is proportioned to the diarrhoea, and is by no means as
{686} great as at the same period in enteric fever.The colicky pains
preceding and accompanying the stools are a more marked feature of
intestinal catarrh; they are absent in enteric fever or have a feeble
intensity.In children between the ages of two and seven years there are certain
peculiarities which augment the difficulties of diagnosis.Intestinal
catarrh in them is accompanied by an abundant, frequently painless
diarrhoea, by tympanites, cerebral disturbances, a dry and coated
tongue, with sordes on the lips and gums, and by a rapidly-developed
anaemia, emaciation, and exhaustion.Typhoid fever in children of this
age is generally benignant; vomiting is more common than in adults;
high grades of meteorism are infrequent; tenderness of the caecal
region is determined with greater difficulty; and severe nervous
phenomena and fatal intestinal complications rarely occur.[38] In other
words, in young children intestinal catarrh by its severity and enteric
fever by its benignity more nearly approach each other than in adults;
in many instances the diagnosis must be undecided until late in the
attack.[Footnote 38: Consult "Diseases of Children," Henoch, _Wood's Library_,
New York, 1882, p.Typhoid fever can of course be known if rose-spots, a splenic tumor, or
the characteristic delirium are manifested, or if the fever-curve
conforms to the type; but in children all these symptoms may be
negative; even the fever has great variability.If fever is continued
beyond ten days, and is accompanied by progressive anaemia and
emaciation and debility, the attack is enteric fever if all local
causes of fever can be excluded.There is no minimum limit to the
temperature in typhoid fever, and no matter how low the maxima of the
fastigium may be, typhoid fever cannot be excluded.[39]

[Footnote 39: Johnston, "On the Diagnosis of Mild Cases of Typhoid
Fever," _Am.Sci._, Oct., 1875, p.372; also, "On the Mild
Forms of Continued Fever in Washington," _Am.Sci._, Oct.,
1882, p.The large watery stools and the absence of tenesmus mark the difference
between diarrhoea and dysentery.Blood may be present in colitis, owing
to a high grade of inflammation and to ulceration.Simple catarrh of
the rectum, proctitis, is not readily distinguished from infective
dysentery.Small mucous and bloody stools may be catarrhal.In the
present state of our knowledge dysentery would be known by marked
tenesmus, by the grave general symptoms, the reddish fluid stools with
flocculi, and by its occurrence in epidemic form.Enteralgia presents the following features which distinguish it from
intestinal catarrh: The tongue in enteralgia is clean or coated white,
but with no red tip and edges; the appetite is capricious, but not
lost; the bowels are constipated; the pain bears no relation to the
ingestion of food or drink, as in enteritis.Fever is accidental, and
there are other nervous phenomena.In lead colic there is no fever,
tympanites, nor diarrhoea.In rheumatism of the abdominal walls the
pain is superficial and sharp, not griping, and is increased by
movements of the trunk.The digestive system is in no way disordered.From peritonitis intestinal catarrh is distinguished by a less degree
of illness and by its usually favorable result, by diarrhoea, a greater
freedom in movement, and by a less degree of suffering on palpating the
abdomen.Tympanites, constipation, great tenderness on pressure over
the abdomen, and a small, quick pulse, point to peritonitis.{687} PROGNOSIS.--A simple intestinal catarrh of the form first
described involves no danger, and if treated by rest and diet soon
recovers.The more severe form, beginning as a primary disease, when
rationally treated ends in recovery in most instances.Unfavorable predisposing causes are--a hot climate (India, the West
Indies, and intertropical climates in general); very hot weather of the
summer and autumn months; a very early or very advanced age; the
contaminated atmosphere of prisons, camps, etc.; all bad hygienic
influences; and previous or coexisting illness.When diarrhoea occurs
as a complication of the acute infectious diseases it has a special
gravity.In typhoid fever, scarlatina, measles, acute tuberculosis,
etc.During the progress
of chronic general diseases (malaria, scurvy, tuberculosis) it becomes
an obstinate and sometimes a fatal complication.Among the exciting
causes mineral poisons induce the most dangerous form of intestinal
catarrh.Unfavorable symptoms occurring during the course of acute
diarrhoea are the early development of high temperature, cerebral
disturbance, great sensibility to pressure over the abdomen, thin and
bloody or highly offensive stools, involuntary discharges, and very
rapid emaciation and loss of strength.TREATMENT.--There have been many fluctuations of opinion as to the
relative value of modes of treatment in this disease.Various
therapeutic measures have been suggested which, after enjoying favor
for a time, have been abandoned, and revived after long periods of
disfavor.Venesection was alternately recommended and forbidden.Emetics and evacuants, mercurials, diuretics, diaphoretics, have been
in turn warmly supported and vigorously opposed.Opium, belladonna, the
various astringents, and cinchona-bark have run through many changes of
favor.Individual drugs give curious evidence of inconstancy.Oxide of
zinc, suggested by James Adair in 1785 and by Hendy in 1784, after a
hundred years of weak approval is commended highly by Penrose (1863),
Brakenridge, and Mackey (1873),[40] and by more recent writers.Acetate
of lead, which dates back to Paracelsus, had varying fortunes of repute
and disrepute.In the end of the seventeenth century it had a name for
curing diarrhoea, but in the following century it was spoken of by
Boerhaave as a deceitful and destructive poison, and Cullen in 1789
said that hardly any one then thought of using lead internally.[41] In
1799 it had warm advocates in this country; among them, Thomas Ewall of
Washington, who wrote in 1808.Since then it has come into very general
use and favor, which it still holds.[Footnote 40: J. J. Woodward, _op.780 _et seq._]

In view of the many changes of faith in systems of treatment and in
drugs, we have no right to assume that we have as yet reached the
perfection of treatment.In fact, experience brings the conviction that
our systems are quite imperfect and that drugs fail in our hands when
they are most needed.The prophylactic treatment is of importance, especially in children,
delicate persons, and in those suffering from disease or predisposed by
idiosyncrasy to intestinal catarrh.Directions must be given by the
physician as to the food for children appropriate to their age and
digestive capacity.Summer heat and city life being so fatal to them,
they should {688} be sent to the cool climate of the seashore or
mountains during the first and second years of life.In warm weather
laxatives should not be given to children, except with precautions
against their acting too freely; the same rule applies to the aged.Too
great care in diet in older children predisposes to indigestion and
diarrhoea.Variety in food is of service, therefore.It is not well to
give children food prepared so as to do away with the necessity for
mastication and for active gastric movements.All reasonable care should be used not to take
food in excess of the individual's power of digestion.Unripe fruit,
stale vegetables or fruits, cheese, pork, shellfish which are not
absolutely fresh, are among the aliments which may produce diarrhoea,
and are to be avoided.Many people have to be told what food is
unsuited to them, and certain articles of food in individual cases
invariably excite diarrhoea.Alcohol is often to be blamed for
diarrhoeas which are attributed to indigestible food, and frequent
recurrences of intestinal catarrh can only be prevented by abandoning
stimulants altogether.The bad effects of sudden changes in temperature
are warded off by wearing flannel next to the body.This is an
important rule for adults as for children.Even in summer thin flannel
or gauze gives protection.Well-ventilated rooms, good house-drainage,
personal cleanliness, with all other hygienic aids, are means of
prevention.Persistent disinfection of sources of air- and
water-contamination should be practised, especially in hot weather.In
the country the open privies and wells need frequent clearing out.Cases of fatal diarrhoea are met with in elevated regions where the
continued low temperature renders it improbable that heat could have
anything to do with their causation.[42] Water should not be used which
could in any way be tainted with soakage from privies, barnyards, or
other places where animal decomposition is going on.[43] Avoiding the
use of cathartics in the onset of acute illness, the nature of which is
not known, is a useful prophylactic measure.A fatal diarrhoea may
result from injudicious purging in such cases.Care in the use of
laxatives should be observed in the chronic wasting
diseases--tuberculosis, rachitis, cancer, etc.[Footnote 42: The yearly occurrence of typhoid fever and diarrhoea at
seashore hotels shows that there is great danger in crowding persons
together and saturating the soil with the excreta.In the summer of
1882 in a boarding-house in the mountains of Maryland, where the
temperature was never above 75 degrees, there were three fatal cases of
diarrhoea in children, and several others of diarrhoea and dysentery
which recovered.][Footnote 43: The drinking-water supplying a country boarding-house
visited by the writer passed through iron pipes imbedded in the
manure-heap of a barnyard.]The selection of a plan of treatment for intestinal catarrh will depend
upon the nature and cause of the symptoms.The diagnosis of the case is
incomplete and the treatment irrational until the indications furnished
by etiology have been obtained.If cold has been the exciting cause, the patient should be confined to
bed.In the beginning a full dose of pilocarpin, hypodermically,[44] or
of the fluid extract of jaborandi by the mouth, may cause a powerful
diversion from the bowel to the skin.A hot-water or vapor bath has the
same object in view.Hot fomentations or mustard poultices can be next
applied to the abdomen.This should be succeeded by a febrifuge {689}
mixture containing the tincture of aconite-root, to which an opiate
(the deodorized tincture of opium or morphia) is to be added if there
is much pain or diarrhoea.A hypodermic injection of morphia given on
the first day of the attack immediately after a hot bath will give a
quiet night and diminish the intensity of the illness.The subsequent
treatment is that common to all the acute forms.[Footnote 44: Atropia can be given with pilocarpin to diminish its
effect on the heart; atropia is the antidote for pilocarpin.(See
Schuk, _Centralb.357; also,
Frohnmuller, _Med.-Chir.Centralb._, July 14, 1882.)]If summer heat has been the cause in adults or children, artificial
cooling of the temperature of the room by the evaporation of ice-water
or by one of the refrigerating machines yet to be perfected meet the
indication.If there is much body-heat (thermic fever), cold sponging,
the application of cold to the head, or the giving of pounded ice to
satisfy the intense thirst, are all advisable.Such cases are benefited
by a change of climate when the acute symptoms subside.The form of
diarrhoea due to malaria is to be treated by quinia and change of air
to a more healthful climate.Iron, with quinia or arsenic, is needed in
obstinate cases.Intestinal catarrh which proceeds from the presence of undigested food
or hard fecal lumps in the bowel is benefited by early removal of the
irritating cause.It is not often that substances of this kind are
retained when the stools are large and frequent.The peristalsis is
here as active as it need be, and no good, but only harm, can come from
over-stimulating the contractile muscles.In those instances where
there is a distinct history of the taking of indigestible food,
especially fruit with seeds or skins, and where the efforts at stool
are frequent, ineffectual, and accompanied by colic and borborygmi, or
where scybalae are found floating in the fluid passed, a large enema of
warm water given slowly will excite the bowel to successful expulsive
efforts.If this does not give a certain amount of prompt relief, a
moderate dose of castor oil, calomel, Rochelle or Epsom salts ought to
be prescribed, and repeated after some hours until a free fluid or
semi-fluid stool results; one or two doses will usually suffice.If the
inflammation is localized in the caecum (typhlitis), as indicated by
local pain, tenderness on pressure in the right iliac or right lumbar
regions, constipation, flexing of the right thigh on the trunk, and
vomiting, a purgative should not be given, nor should prolonged efforts
be made to empty the bowel by injection through long rectal tubes.If
there is doubt as to whether typhlitis or undigested food and fecal
impaction is the cause of the local pain, it is better to err on the
safe side, and not to give a purgative unless the case is seen in the
onset before the more pronounced symptoms appear; then calomel or
castor oil may be tried once, but not repeated in case of failure.As the diarrhoea of Bright's disease is salutary, no effort should be
made to arrest it.In
tuberculosis the special character of the diarrhoea must be considered,
and every effort must be made to control it.In the eruptive fevers an
early diarrhoea, as in scarlet fever, does harm; it delays or prevents
the normal development of the eruption.In the later stages it is of
service sometimes, as in measles, when it leads to a rapid fall of
temperature.The course of action depends upon the nature of the
specific disease and upon the time of the appearance of diarrhoea.There are certain principles, founded on the knowledge derived from
pathological study and from the experience of the past in the treatment
{690} of intestinal catarrh, which guide us to a treatment which is
more or less rational in all cases.Rest is essential to the cure of the inflamed intestine, but absolute
inertia of the bowel is undesirable, even injurious.The retention of
fluids, transuded serum, bile, intestinal juices, and partly-altered
food is hurtful.Decomposition sets in and gas is developed, which by
distending the bowel causes great suffering and increases the
inflammation.The movements of the intestine are not entirely under
control; the patient must be fed; digestion and assimilation involve
the activity of inflamed parts.The stomach can be made to do most of
the work, but the sympathy of action is so close between the stomach
and intestines that one cannot function without the other being excited
into activity.The first rule of treatment is to put the patient to bed and to keep
him in a horizontal position.Even in mild cases time will be saved by
resorting to absolute rest at once.If the attack is at all severe, the
bed-pan should be used; the effort to rise and the straining at stool
exaggerate peristaltic movement, increasing the frequency of the
evacuations.Additional rest can be given to the intestines by applying
a flannel binder around the trunk, compressing the abdomen; broad
strips of adhesive plaster could be used for the same purpose.In cases
where the diarrhoea, tympanites, and griping pain are not relieved by
other measures this suggestion may be of service.In order to lessen intestinal hyperaemia and allay suffering,
counter-irritants and soothing external applications are employed.Local blood-letting, although in vogue during more than two centuries,
has fallen into disuse.Recent authors still continue to advise the
application of leeches to the anus in order to deplete the portal
circulation,[45] but it is a decided objection to this remedy that the
fluid stools irritate the leech-bites and cause much discomfort.Sinapisms or turpentine stupes may be of some service apart from the
relief which they give to pain.Blisters might be more generally used
than they are when the tenderness on pressure is confined to the colon.Hot poultices of
flaxseed meal or hot fomentations of any sort applied over the entire
abdomen have a soothing and beneficial effect.A flannel compress
saturated with alcohol and covered with gutta-percha cloth makes a most
agreeable application.[Footnote 45: Niemeyer, _Practice of Medicine, Intestinal Catarrh_.]The directions for diet should be carefully and explicitly given.In
the onset of the attack entire deprivation of all food for twenty-four
or forty-eight hours is expedient.To relieve thirst, cracked ice,
carbonic-acid water, Apollinaris, Seltzer, or Deep Rock water can be
ordered; barley- or rice-water is slightly nourishing and relieves
thirst, but all liquids should be given in moderation.When it becomes
necessary to give food, the stomach must be made to do the work of
digestion, and, as far as possible, of absorption also.Such substances
are to be chosen as are converted in the stomach into peptones, and
which do not require contact with the intestinal juices for their
absorption.The peptones transformed in the stomach from nitrogenous alimentary
principles are highly soluble and diffusible.Milk is better suited to
the conditions of intestinal catarrh than any other nitrogenous food.It is palatable, relieves the thirst, and can be taken for a long time
without {691} aversion.By removing the cream, the fat, which would
require intestinal digestion, is partly got rid of.Skimmed milk does
not produce a feeling of distaste and what is called biliousness, as
does milk unskimmed.In cases where there is gastric catarrh the milk
can be made more digestible by adding an equal quantity of barley-water
or rice-water.The casein is then more slowly acted on by the gastric
juice and more thoroughly digested.Milk should be given in small
quantities at short intervals, as in this way the stomach performs the
entire work more thoroughly.If a large quantity is given, a portion of
it passes into the intestine unaltered.Buttermilk contains less fatty
matter than skimmed milk, and is a pleasant substitute for it.Koumiss,
if it could be properly prepared, would be an excellent food for
diarrhoea.Even the imperfect imitations are retained and digested when
other aliments fail.The whey of milk contains lactin, salts, a little
casein, and fatty matter.It may be made by adding to milk rennet,
sherry or other wine, cream of tartar, tamarind-juice, or alum.Milk-whey is slightly nourishing, and is said to be sudorific; when
prepared with wine it is a mild stimulant well suited to the cases of
children.Where it is desired to give as little work to the digestive organs as
is possible, milk and other foods can be given already partly digested,
as peptonized milk prepared according to the formulae of Roberts and
Fothergill.[46] Eggs are changed quickly in the stomach.Egg albumen is
more easily digested by artificial gastric juice than by pancreatic
extract (Roberts).A solution of egg albumen boiled in the water-bath
is swiftly and entirely transformed by pepsin and hydrochloric acid.Raw eggs have been thought to be the most digestible, but Roberts found
that a solution of egg albumen when raw was very slowly acted on by
pepsin and acid, but after being cooked it was rapidly and entirely
digested.Eggs are best given, therefore, boiled slightly at a slow
heat; when an egg is plunged in boiling water the white sets hard,
leaving the yelk soft.The albumen of the white and the yelk should be
equally cooked throughout.[Footnote 46: J. M. Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New
York, 1881, p.63 _et seq._ See also quote to article on CHRONIC
INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Beef-tea is said by the chemist to possess little nutritive value;
practical experience convinces the physician that it supports life.Peptonized beef-tea may be substituted when thought best.Animal broths
thickened with rice, barley, or with peptonized gruel, as advised by
Fothergill, or with the addition of vermicelli, are valuable aids when
the palate is capricious.Raw beef is not as digestible as when the
tendinous and aponeurotic structures of the muscular fibre have been
softened, disintegrated, and converted into the soluble and
easily-digested form of gelatin by cooking.[47] Scraped raw beef, when
the pulp is removed from much of the connective tissue, is easily
digested by children as well as by adults.In most cases of acute intestinal catarrh the patient can be well
sustained by a diet consisting of one or other of the aliments
described.For the largest number milk alone--that is, skimmed milk or
milk diluted with barley-water, rice-water, or Seltzer water--is all
that is necessary to support strength during the attack.Although
starch after deglutition is {692} acted on in the intestine only, it
becomes desirable sometimes to give farinaceous food in some form or
other; milk may be undigested and animal broths may become distasteful;
the palate craves some change.In this case a blanc mange made after
the formula of Meigs and Pepper is as well suited to adults as to
children,[48] the proportion of cream and arrowroot being made larger
for adults.Sago[49] and tapioca[50] can be tried to tempt the palate.The flour of the Egyptian lentil[51] is made into a gruel also.Most of
the patent foods for infants and invalids contain starch in some form
or other.Racahout is one of the pleasantest and best of these.Nestle's food contains baked biscuits of wheat flour ground to a
powder.Liebig's food is made of wheat flour, malt flour, and a little
bicarbonate of potassium.Revalenta Arabica is an attractive name for
the flour of Arabian lentil with barley flour.Any of these may be
advantageously employed in cases of some duration and in the later
stages of convalescence.[Footnote 48: Meigs and Pepper, _Diseases of Children_, Philada., 1870,
p.[Footnote 49: Put half an ounce of sago into an enamelled saucepan with
three-quarters of a pint of cold water, and boil gently for an hour and
a quarter.Skim when it comes to the boil, and stir frequently.Sweeten
with a dessertspoonful of sifted loaf sugar.If wine be ordered, two
dessertspoonfuls; and if brandy, one dessertspoonful.][Footnote 50: Half an ounce of the best tapioca to a pint and a quarter
of new milk.Simmer gently for two hours and a quarter, stirring
frequently; sweeten with a dessertspoonful of sifted sugar.][Footnote 51: Take three tablespoonfuls of lentil flour, a
salt-spoonful of salt, and one pint of water.Mix the flour and salt
into a paste with the water and boil ten minutes, stirring (_Food for
the Invalid_, Fothergill and Wood, New York, 1880).]The diet for convalescence should be controlled by the physician until
the patient has been well for at least two weeks.Liquid preparations
give place to fine hominy, corn meal or oatmeal porridge, with milk.Then bread or crackers may be given, the intervals between the meals
increasing to three or four hours.Raw oysters, sweetbreads, tender
rare steak or mutton finely divided and well masticated, rice, and ripe
peaches, succeed the simpler diet.Much saccharine, starchy, or fatty
food is to be avoided for at least two weeks after entire recovery.When the indications derived from the study of the cause have been
acted on, and the patient has been placed under a rigid discipline of
rest and diet, the treatment of symptoms comes next in order.In mild cases, where the cause has been irritating ingesta, diet may
relieve the symptoms in a short time without medicine.If diarrhoea
with slight colicky pains and flatulence continue after a few hours, a
mixture holding in suspension subnitrate of bismuth, with five drops of
the deodorized tincture of opium in each dose, or a pill of lead and
opium, will suffice in a short time to give relief.In severer attacks
the fever heat may mount to a high point, giving great distress to the
patient.If a temperature of 103 degrees to 104 degrees F. is
reached--which is not unusual in children--a warm bath is a sedative
and antipyretic remedy, or a bath of 95 degrees can be gradually cooled
down to 75 degrees or 65 degrees F.--a procedure which will bring down
the body-heat two or three degrees.A substitution for the bath is
sponging with cool or cold water, to which vinegar or bay rum may be
added; or towels wrung out of cold water can be applied to the trunk
and extremities (Ringer) with a very happy effect.Quinia can be used antipyretically in full doses, dissolved in dilute
hydrochloric acid.Pills, especially the sugar- or gelatin-coated
pills, {693} should not be given, as they irritate the mucous membrane
whether they are dissolved or not.In diarrhoea quinia pills often pass
unaltered.Flatulence, eructations of gas, and borborygmi are controlled by strict
diet according to the rules given.Bismuth subnitrate or subcarbonate
unites with sulphuretted hydrogen and absorbs it.The alkalies, sodium
and potassium bicarbonate, sodium hyposulphite, the aromatic spirits of
ammonia, either relieve acidity or prevent fermentation and the
development of gas.A satisfactory formula for the early stages of
intestinal catarrh is one containing bismuth subcarbonate, sodium
bicarbonate, aromatic spirits of ammonia in water or cinnamon-water.When the abdominal distension is great enough to be a cause of
distress, external cold--dry cold--is the best, applied with a rubber
bag filled with cracked ice or ice-water; it causes absorption of gas.Abdominal compression with a bandage may be of some service also.Mineral acids, especially the dilute hydrochloric acid, by affording
aid to the digestion prevent acid fermentation.Diarrhoea is the central symptom and the best standard by which to
measure the intensity of the catarrh and its progress.But it is only a
symptom, and the mind ought to be directed to the lesion and not to it.Having the cause in view, the object in all cases is to allay the
inflammation.This done, the diarrhoea decreases, then ceases.Shall
the effort be made to check the discharges, or shall they be allowed to
continue?The evacuant plan of treatment has been advocated, on the
ground that the purgative, by increasing intestinal secretion, relieves
the congestion of the intestinal blood-vessels and leaves the membrane
in a better state than before.[52] But inasmuch as a purgative only
acts by bringing about an intestinal hyperaemia and catarrh, there is
no good reason for, and many reasons against, treatment by evacuation.A preliminary purgative, as has already been stated, is necessary to
expel undigested food and scybalae, but for the purpose of increasing
intestinal or biliary secretion and diminishing engorgement of the
vessels this method is unsuccessful and unnecessary.When irritating
substances have been removed (and this is done usually without the
physician's aid by the spontaneous expulsive movements of the bowel)
the effort to check the discharge and to give rest is one and the same.Opium is the one invaluable remedy which we cannot do without.[53] As
little of it should be given as is necessary to relieve the intensity
of the symptoms.The aim should not be to stop the pain and check
diarrhoea, but to take the edge off the sharp agony and to lengthen the
interval between the stools.Thus gradually the spasms of peristalsis
cease, and there is a diminution, and finally cessation, of the fluid
accumulation in the bowel.The diarrhoea is relieved entirely in a
period ranging from an hour after the giving of the first dose to one
week, according to the severity of the attack.Opium is given in pill
form, in the deodorized tincture, Dover's powder, or one of the salts
of morphia may be preferred.Any of these may be combined with antacid
and antifermentative mixtures, relieving the colic, gaseous distension,
and diarrhoea.If opium is combined with, {694} or followed by,
evacuants, its effects are thwarted, and it might as well not be given
at all.[Footnote 53: The objections urged against opium, that it increases
thirst and nervousness, causes a retention of fermenting products,
produces opium intoxication, and that it is a routine practice to give
it, and does not cure the inflammation, may be valid, but we cannot do
without opium, nevertheless.]It is the custom to combine astringents with opium, but in acute cases
of short duration it is a question whether astringents do not do more
harm than good.When good does come from the combination, it is the
opium which acts promptly and decidedly.The astringent lags behind,
and in cases of some duration and severity supplements the work of the
active partner.Bismuth is classed under this head, although it is not
an astringent.Its action is mechanical; much that is taken is passed
from the bowel as the black sulphide, which appears as a black granular
powder in the fluid stool.This is no proof that it may not have been
of service in its transit.[54] After death, when large doses have been
given, it has been found lining the whole intestinal canal.[55] The
subnitrate or subcarbonate can be given in powder on an empty stomach
in doses of five to twenty grains alone or in combination with opium,
or it can be dispensed with alkalies in water.The enormous doses (one
hundred and fifty to nine hundred grains daily), as given by Monneret,
are useless or hurtful.The value of bismuth is based on empirical
grounds only, but it is irrational to load the bowel with an insoluble
powder which if retained must cause irritation.As the discoloration of
the stools is an objection to bismuth when it is desired to study their
character for diagnosis, oxide of zinc may be substituted for it, as
the latter is an absorbent of acids and gases.[56] Gubler has insisted
upon combining it with bicarbonate of sodium to prevent the formation
of the irritating chloride of zinc in the stomach.[57] One of the
oldest and most popular remedies tor diarrhoea is lime in the form of
the carbonate or lime-water.The officinal mistura cretae is perhaps
more generally used for children than any other remedy.Lime-water is
added with advantage to milk when given to adults as well as children.Carrara-water, made by dissolving the bicarbonate of lime with an
excess of carbonic acid, is less nauseous than liquor calcis, and may
be mixed with an equal part of milk.[58] Chalk and its preparations are
less beneficial than bismuth as astringents, but may be used merely for
their antacid effect.[Footnote 54: Headland asserted that bismuth was insoluble, but it has
been detected in the liver, in milk, in urine, and in the serum of
dropsy by Orfila, Sewald, Bergeret, and Mayencon (_Materia Med._,
Phillips, vol.[Footnote 55: Levick, _Am.Sci._, July, 1858, p.[Footnote 56: Bonamy, "Du Traitement des Diarrhees rebelles par l'Oxyde
de Zinc," _Bull.251; also, J.
Jacquier, _De l'Emploi de l'Oxyde de Zinc dans la Diarrhee_, Paris,
Thesis, 1878, No.[Footnote 57: Gubler, _Principles of Therapeutics_, Philada., 1881, p.[Footnote 58: Phillips, _Materia Medica_, vol.The sugar of lead is a valuable astringent, because unirritating and
sedative to the mucous membrane.With opium in pill form, in doses of
one to three grains, it checks diarrhoea if the inflammation has not
lasted long and is not extensive.If there are cases where the bile is
passed in quantity, it is especially called for, as it is the only
astringent which diminishes the flow of bile.The mineral acids--dilute hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric
acids--are given with some success.The first aids gastric digestion,
and in small doses with pepsin can be directed after food irrespective
of other treatment.The great repute which it has enjoyed in the
diarrhoea of typhoid is no doubt due to the improved digestion and
assimilation {695} which follow its use.The acid principle is what is
lacking in the gastric juice in fever and debility.[59] In all cases of
intestinal catarrh rapidity of gastric digestion should be sought for.Without an opiate in combination
there is little reason to hope for any result from its use; all the
suggested formulae contain opiates.[60] Dilute sulphuric acid is
thought to be more astringent than the others.If it has any efficacy,
it is due to the local astringent or alterative effect by contact with
the inflamed surface.Much testimony is to be found in its support in
cases tending to become chronic and where astringents combined with
opiates have failed after some days' trial.It should be administered
in doses of five to twenty drops in the form of mixture with mucilage
or some aromatic, as lavender and cardamom.An opiate should not be
combined with it if it is desired to test it fairly.It would be called
for when the stools are pale, abundant, watery, and alkaline.[Footnote 59: Manassein, _Virchow's Archiv_, lv., 1872, p.[Footnote 60: The favor in which nitric acid is held is due to the
advocacy of nitrous acid by Hope ("Observations on the Powerful Effects
of a Mixture containing Nitrous Acid and Opium in curing Dysentery,
Cholera, and Diarrhoea," _Edin.Nitrous acid, the same as the fuming nitric acid of the
shops, is a reddish-yellow fluid highly charged with nitrogen trioxide.Hope said that ordinary nitric acid did not produce the same effects,
and yet nitric acid is now given with the belief that it is of
service.]Calomel is of ancient repute as a remedy in the early stages of
diarrhoea.According to recent views, it acts as a sedative to the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane and checks fermentation.It should be
given in small doses (one-twelfth to one-eighth of a grain to children,
one-fourth to one-half of a grain to adults); it should not be
continued for more than two or three days.In combination with Dover's
powder it acts well, but it is doubtful which of the two remedies
should receive the greater praise for the resulting improvement.A very
small dose of the bichloride of mercury has been found beneficial by
Ringer for clayey, pasty stools or straining stools containing slime
and blood.j; Aquae fluidounce
x; a teaspoonful frequently during the day.The gray powder is not as
much thought of now as formerly; it is not so good for the early stages
of diarrhoea as calomel, but may be tried as an alterative when the
stools are green and offensive.In the vegetable materia medica there are many and ancient remedies.Tannin represents a large class, and there is nothing more than fancy
in preferring to it kino, catechu, haematoxylon, or blackberry-root.Tannin is precipitated in the stomach as an inert tannate; gallic acid
is to be preferred for this reason, and also for its pleasant taste and
less irritating effect on the mucous membrane.It is well borne by
children, even in large doses, when given with water and syrup.It is
to be hoped that the unsightly and unsavory combinations of the
astringent tinctures with chalk mixture will be soon given up.They are
given chiefly to children, who are repelled by the sight, and still
more by the taste, of such compounds.The syrup of krameria is the
least objectionable, and catechu and krameria are made into troches
which are sometimes available.Ipecacuanha is said by Bartholow to be extremely serviceable in the
diarrhoea of teething children with greenish stools containing mucus or
blood.He prescribes it with bismuth and pepsin.{696} Recently some favor has been paid to coto-bark and its active
principle, cotoin.The latter is advised to be given in the following
formula:

  Rx.Cotoinae,        gr.j;
      Aquae distillat.fluidounce iv;
      Alcohol,         gtt.x;
      Syrupi,          fluidounce j.

A tablespoonful every hour.Five to eight drops of the fluid extract of
coto are given.It is said to have a speedy and certain effect in acute
diarrhoea.[61]

[Footnote 61: Coto-bark was imported into Europe from Bolivia in 1873,
and was called quinquina coto.Wittstein of Munich and Julius Jobst of
Stuttgart made the first analyses (_Neues Repertorium fur Pharmacie_,
xxiv.Von Gietl (_idem_, xxv.)first concluded from
experiments that it was of use in diarrhoea.Cotoin and paracotoin were
separated by Jobst.It has been found successful in the treatment of
diarrhoea in Germany and of cholera in Japan (Baelz, _Centralb.Wissen._, 1878, xvi.Cotoin sometimes disturbs the
digestion to a marked degree.Paracotoin may be used hypodermically.]Salicin,[62] ergot, guarana, have all been spoken of by enthusiasts as
possessing valuable properties in diarrhoea.[Footnote 62: Lawson, "Diarrhoea and its Treatment at the London
Hospitals," _Med.122; Bishop,
"Salicin in Diarrhoea and Dysentery," _Southern Med.585; "Comparative Value of Opium and Salicin in Diarrhoea and
Dysentery," _Detroit Review of Med.Sulphate of copper is fitted for cases in
danger of passing into the chronic stage.Sulphate of zinc might be
more generally ordered than is the case.The sulphate of iron and the
fluid preparations of iron--tincture of the chloride, solution of the
pernitrite, and persulphate--are astringents, and could be tried if
other remedies fail.The effect of nitrate of silver is to constrict
vessels, to coagulate and disinfect excretions, and to form an adherent
protecting membrane (Phillips).It occupies the next place to lead, and
is suited to a subacute stage when acute symptoms have subsided.It is
warmly recommended by William Pepper and others.[63] The oxide of
silver has been preferred by some writers.[64] For the protracted
diarrhoea of children, in whom follicular ulcers form so rapidly, the
nitrate of silver is of special value.To adults it is administered in
a pill freshly made in doses of one-eighth to one grain.A solution in
distilled water with syrup answers well for children, the dose varying
from one-twentieth to one-fourth of a grain.[Footnote 63: J. Maggregor, "On the Internal Use of Nitrate of Silver
in Inflammation of the Intestines," _Lancet_, 1841, vol.[Footnote 64: Lane, _Med.-Chir.289 _et seq._;
Eyre, _The Stomach and its Difficulties_, London, 1852.]The theory of the germ origin of diarrhoea has naturally brought into
notice antiseptic remedies.Carbolic acid,[65] creasote,[66]
naphtha,[67] sulpho-carbolate of calcium,[68] salicylic acid,[69] and
chlorine-water have each been advocated.Practice does not support
their claim to be considered remedies for intestinal inflammation.[Footnote 65: Habershon, _Lancet_, London, 1868, vol.7; C. G.
Rothe, _Berliner klin.Wochenschrift_, 1871, p.583;
_ibid._, vol.des Hopitaux_, 1849, p.[Footnote 69: W. Wagner, _Kolbe's Journ.{697} Treatment by the rectum may be employed when medicines are
rejected by the stomach or when it is desired to bring the drugs into
more direct contact with the inflamed colon.Opiates, astringents, and
alteratives are employed in this way.Laudanum in two to four ounces of
warm water or in warm milk or starch-water can be thrown into the
rectum, the fluid being allowed to remain.The injections are to be
given often enough to relieve pain and lessen the number of discharges.With the laudanum, or without it, the mineral astringents can be used
by enema.Acetate of lead or sulphate of zinc is to be preferred.The
objection that but a small portion of the inflamed surface is reached
by the fluid is a valid one, and therefore those cases are most
benefited where the catarrh is in the lower colon and rectum.Ringer[70] says that it is not at all necessary for the fluid to reach
that part of the intestine which is the seat of the catarrh; the
impression made on one part is communicated to the other by sympathy.It was the practice with O'Beirne,[71] Hare,[72] and others to inject
fluid by a long flexible tube passed beyond the sigmoid flexure.This
method is advocated and employed in Europe by Mosler, Winterinz, and
Monti.Quite recently Dulles has drawn attention to irrigation of the
large intestine as a means of treating inflammation of the colon,
according to the plan of Alois Monti of Vienna.[73] Henoch has tried
with partial success in children the throwing into the rectum of a
large quantity of water holding in solution acetate of lead, alum, or
tannin.His method contemplates medication above the sigmoid flexure; a
part of the fluid escapes, while the rest remains five or ten minutes
in the bowel.[74] Monti says as much as two pints can be injected into
the bowel of a nursing child--for older children twice this quantity.[Footnote 70: _Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.[Footnote 71: _New Views of the Process of Defecation_, Washington,

two minutes.[77]

CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic intestinal catarrh has many of the same causes as
the acute form; it is the expression of a large number of different
pathological states and complicates many general and local diseases.It is very common in children under two years of age, and is associated
with change in diet in weaning and with the irritability of all the
tissues during dentition.It is also a frequent disease in old persons,
being due to imperfect mastication, the weakness of digestion, portal
congestion, the gouty diathesis, and other causes.[1] Men have the
disease more frequently than women.Hereditary influence and
idiosyncrasy predispose to chronic catarrh of the bowel as to catarrh
of the bronchi.Bad hygiene, want of cleanliness with an unhealthy
condition of the skin, constant breathing of foul air due to want of
proper ventilation, animal decomposition, or overcrowding predisposes
to chronic diarrhoea.The chronic diarrhoeas among soldiers in
camps,[2] among the inmates of prisons, workhouses, and asylums, are
examples of these influences.Overwork, especially mental overwork with
anxiety, and privation of sleep act in the same direction.In the
chronic constitutional diseases and in many chronic diseases of organs
diarrhoea sooner or later appears, and very generally is the immediate
cause of death.In phthisis pulmonum, whether tubercular or not, simple
catarrh of the bowel is nearly always present.[Footnote 1: _La Diarrhee chez les Viellards_, Paris, Thesis, 1865, No.See also works of Durand-Fardel and Charcot and Loomis.][Footnote 2: According to the statistics prepared in 1871 by T. B. Hood
of the U.S.Pension Office, chronic diarrhoea was the disease for which
a pension was granted in 20 per cent.of all cases of disability from
disease and in 75 per cent.of all the diseases of the digestive system
(_Report of Commissioner of Pensions_, 1871).]During the course of chronic Bright's disease, more frequently in the
cirrhotic form, lesions are developed in the intestine which cause
obstinate diarrhoea.The discharge of urea into the intestine, and its
conversion into carbonate of ammonium, which acts as an irritant to the
mucous membrane, is the reason of the diarrhoea in this disease,
according to Luton and Treitz;[3] and in so far as the discharge
represents the escape of urea by the bowel, it may be regarded as
salutary.In gout, especially in old persons, periodical diarrhoea
gives relief.Chronic gouty subjects assert that they are not benefited
by colchicum until it has purged them.The {700} lithic-acid diathesis,
pyaemia, septicaemia, scurvy,[4] diabetes, leucocythaemia, Addison's
disease, and syphilis[5] have diarrhoea during some part of their
progress.The malarial cachexia is often attended with a diarrhoea
which quinia alone will relieve; this symptom may occur periodically or
be constant.[Footnote 3: A. Luton, _Des Series morbides, Affections uremiques de
l'Intestin_, Paris, Thesis, 1859, No.45; also, Treitz, "Ueber
uramische Darmaffectionen," _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.[Footnote 4: See testimony as to the influence of scurvy in promoting
diarrhoea (Woodward, _Med.History of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, p.[Footnote 5: A. Trousseau, "Comments on a Case of Syphilitic Diarrhoea
cured by Mercury," _Clinique med._, Paris, 1868, t. iii.Disease of the liver, heart, or lungs, by retarding the circulation in
the portal system, causes venous stasis and catarrh in the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The chief conditions which bring
this about are tumors compressing the mesenteric veins, cirrhosis of
the liver, tumors pressing on the ascending vena cava, valvular disease
of the right and left heart, fatty degeneration or dilatation of the
heart, cardiac debility from chronic exhausting diseases, fibroid
phthisis, chronic pneumonic phthisis, chronic pleurisy, and pulmonary
emphysema.An unsuitable diet may not set up an acute catarrh, but may slowly
induce changes of a chronic nature in the mucous membrane.This is the
case in infants fed upon artificial food instead of breast-milk, or
when the digestion is overtaxed after weaning.In adults food difficult
of digestion and over-eating bring about the same result.Alcohol,
spices, and condiments, if taken in excess, and the habitual use of
purgatives, lead to chronic inflammation of the intestine.Foreign bodies, such as fecal concretions, gall-stones, stones of
fruit, bones, coins, and pins, by remaining in contact with the mucous
membrane for a length of time, determine inflammation and
ulceration.[6]

[Footnote 6: Lothrop, "Case of a Child in whom seventeen plum-stones,
three cherry-stones, and seven small bones were impacted In the caecum
and ileum for a year.Inflammation, ulceration, and perforation of the
bowel resulted" (_Buffalo Med.Journ._, March, 1882, p.Neglect in the treatment of acute catarrh, the prolongation of an acute
attack, from its intensity and the incurability of the lesions,
establish chronic disease.All chronic lesions of the bowel are complicated with chronic catarrh,
as chronic tubercular ulcer, neoplasms in the wall, pressure of a tumor
from without, etc.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The alterations in the intestines in chronic
catarrh involve the walls to a much greater extent than in the acute
form.The intestinal tube is dilated, contracted, or irregularly dilated and
contracted.When the calibre is increased the walls are thinned.Hypertrophy and hardening of the tunics, chiefly of the muscular and
submucous tissue, are accompanied by a narrowing of the canal, and this
change, most common in the rectum and sigmoid flexure, sometimes
involves a very considerable extent of the colon.Lebert records the
case of a woman who had diarrhoea for six weeks; constipation and
vomiting with abdominal tenderness ensued.There was hypertrophy of all
the coats of the stomach and of the ascending colon and rectum.The
rectum was so narrowed by the thickening of its wall that a female
catheter could not be passed through it.[7] In chronic catarrh the
mucous membrane {701} of the colon and of the lower part of the ileum
is the seat of the most characteristic lesions.The colon was alone the
seat of disease in 9 out of 99 cases analyzed by Woodward; in the
remaining 90 the two were involved together.In these the lesions in
the colon (especially in the rectum and sigmoid flexure) were always
more advanced and more serious than in the small intestine.[Footnote 7: Lebert, _Path.247, 248; another case,
Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.Gastric catarrh may by extension become duodenal catarrh, and from the
duodenum the disease may extend into the common bile-duct and its
branches.The duodenitis and catarrh of the ducts may persist, and
become chronic after the stomach lesion is gone.The mucous lining of the intestine is changed in color, form,
thickness, consistence, and in the appearance of its glandular
structures.The shades of color in chronic inflammation are dark red,
livid, brown, drab, or slate-color, light blue, and greenish.Dark-red and gray spots are seen on a pale
and uniform red ground; grayish streaks and patches are mingled with
red or whitish areas, giving rise to a mottled or marbled
appearance.[8] In some cases red predominates, in others the
slate-color.[9] Dark-brown, almost black, patches are also seen.These
different tints depend upon the intensity and character of the
inflammation and the stage which it has reached.Diffused bright-red
discolorations belong to acute inflammation, and are rarely seen in the
chronic form.Acute hyperaemic patches appearing in the midst of a
slate- membrane indicate intercurrent acute attacks.Dark-red
streaks or spots are caused by extravasations.Brown and slate-
areas represent the changes in old extravasations or pigment-deposits
where inflammation or ulceration has existed.Where the inflammation is
progressing toward the destruction of tissue the membrane is
dark-purplish or black in color, mottled with patches of dull reddish
hue and minute spots of bright red.Black dots are seen in the small
and large intestine isolated or in close proximity.They are due to
minute specks of black pigment deposited in the apices of the villi, in
the centres of solitary glands, in rings around them, or in the glands
of a Peyer's patch.The juxtaposition of pinhead black points gives
rise to the shaven-beard appearance[10] of the mucous membrane.Dark
streaks or wavy lines of pigment are also seen.[11]

inflammation see the following illustrations in color: _Med.of the War_, Part 2, Medical Volume--plates facing pp.308, 518,

volume cited, facing p.In the ileum the mucous folds are obliterated or swollen and thickened.Obliteration of the folds occurs in connection with a dilated
intestine; when the intestine is contracted they are elevated,
tortuous, and close together.The villi are hypertrophied, looking
often like minute polypi.The mucous coat is usually thickened,
measuring from one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch.It is softened, and
more easily scraped off,[12] but quite {702} frequently there is
induration instead of softening.The solitary glands of the ileum are
hypertrophied and appear scattered over the mucous surface as small
rounded elevations.They are quite numerous or a few only may be seen.A ring of vascular injection usually surrounds each enlarged follicle.Peyer's patches may be unchanged or from swelling of the follicles are
more prominent than is normal, but relatively the enlargement of the
solitary glands is greater.In chronic catarrh the follicles acquire
greater size than in the acute form.The apices of the solitary glands
in the small intestine may be broken down, leaving small follicular
ulcers, with swollen rings around them formed of the undestroyed and
hypertrophied gland-structure.Here and there one or two of the
follicles in the Peyer's patch may have its centre indented by
ulceration.These changes are usually in the lower part of the ileum
near the caecum.[Footnote 12: The mucous membrane is often tumefied and softened in
cases where there are thickening and contraction of the intestine with
great reduction of its calibre (Elliot Coues, _Med.Rep._,
Philada., 1863, vol.In the colon the enlarged solitary glands are in greater number, and
are dotted about more closely in the descending colon and sigmoid
flexure.[13] When there is ulceration the large intestine has many more
ulcers than the ileum, and they are more numerous in the lower part of
the colon.They appear as sharply-punched openings, and give to the
mucous surface a honeycombed look; their diameter varies from one-tenth
to one-fourth of an inch.Large ulcers formed by the confluence of
smaller ones measure from one-fourth to one inch in diameter; they may
be so deep as to have the muscular tunic for their base, and quite
often the bottom of the ulcers is black.A ragged or uneven appearance
is given to the surface by the ulcers being close together.Such
extensive destruction sometimes takes place that no normal mucous
membrane seems to be left.Perforating ulcers are occasionally seen in
the large intestine or ileum.Perforation occurred in two of Woodward's
ninety-nine cases.Healing ulcers[14] are found by the side of others
which are growing.Healed follicular ulcers are known by a puckered,
stellated appearance[15] of the mucous membrane, which is pigmented and
of a slate-gray or marbled-brown color[16] if the process has been long
completed.Larger dense cicatrices, pigmented also, mark the site of
more extensive ulcerations.[Footnote 13: Illustration, _Kupfertafeln zu_ DR.LESSER _uber die
Entzundung und Verschwarung du Schleimhaut des Verdauungskanales_,

figs.[Footnote 15: Illustration, _Med.[Footnote 16: Illustration, Cruveilhier, _Anat.; also, J. Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, figs.Besides follicular ulcers the mucous membrane is disorganized by ulcers
which have their origin in a loss of epithelium and superficial
erosion.In addition to the lesions already described, the inflamed and
ulcerated surface is sometimes covered with a pseudo-membranous layer
of greenish-yellow color.Chronic catarrh of the duodenum is the cause of dilatation of the
vessels and thickening of the coats.A varicose condition of the veins
may give rise to hemorrhage without ulceration.[17] The orifice of the
common bile-duct and the ducts for some distance are narrowed by
swelling of their lining membrane.[18] Ulcer of the upper part of the
duodenum {703} is found rarely in connection with external burns and
chronic Bright's disease.It is more common in men between thirty and
forty years of age.An embolized artery is the starting-point of the
lesion.The mucous layer, deprived of its nutrition in a limited area,
dies or is destroyed by the acid gastric juice; a round ulcer with
terraced edges is left, its base being the muscular or serous coat.Adhesions may form between the peritoneum near the ulcer and the liver,
gall-bladder, or pancreas, or an opening may take place posteriorly in
the right seventh intercostal space or into the peritoneal cavity.Cicatrization of the ulcer may lead to narrowing of the canal of the
bowel or of the pancreatic and common bile-ducts.[19]

[Footnote 17: G. Coulon, _Bull.[Footnote 18: Duodenitis was made much of by Broussais and his
followers, and a great deal has been written about it.(See Boudin,
Paris, Thesis, 1837, No.76, _Essai sur la Duodenite chronique_.)][Footnote 19: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Amer.Suppuration in the wall of the duodenum is still rarer.One case only
is on record of pus being found in the intestinal wall.[20]

[Footnote 20: Picard, _Bull.xv., 1840-41,
p.See also microscopic view of suppuration in wall of duodenum,
Thierfelder, _Atlas d. path.Histologie_, 2 lief., Tab.Chronic proctitis or inflammation of the rectum may exist by itself.The mucous membrane is swollen, hyperaemic, and the walls may be
indurated and thickened so as to reduce the calibre of the tube.Superficial erosions or deep ulcers and perforation are due to the
retention of hard fecal matter in the distended pouches of the rectum.Inflammation in the tissue around the rectum (periproctitis) is excited
by inflammation of the wall without perforation; abscesses form and
burst externally or into the bowel, thus establishing fistulae.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--The essential primary feature of chronic
catarrh is the increase and persistence of cell-accumulation in the
reticular connective tissue of the mucous and submucous layer.After an
acute or subacute attack some time elapses before the large number of
cell-elements are disintegrated or absorbed.By remaining they offer a
constant invitation to causes of irritation, hence the necessity for
prolonged care in diet after acute attacks.Fresh causes--imprudence in
eating, etc.--induce additions to the number of cells, and the tissue
becomes overcharged with active elements of growth.Hypertrophy of
tissues results, the mucous and submucous tissues thicken, and the
glandular structures are stimulated to a condition of morbid activity.The glands of Lieberkuhn elongate, the number of acini increases, and
the contained cells multiply.Accidental closure of the gland-openings
from outside pressure or over-accumulation of the contents leads to
cyst-formations.The lymph-cells in the reticular tissue of the closed
follicles undergo rapid increase; the follicle is over-distended,
projects above the surface, bursts, and a small ulcerating cavity is
left.This is now enlarged by the breaking down of the remaining tissue
of the follicle, then of the submucosa.The overhanging roof of mucous
membrane, deprived of its nutrition, sloughs off at the edges and the
exposed ulcerated surface is increased.By the confluence of two or
more burrowing ulcers more extensive destruction of the mucous and
submucous layers is brought about.The large deepened ulcers have the
mucous layer for their base.Cicatrization of the ulcers takes place by
the formation of cicatricial tissue at their base; the excavation is
filled up partially, by contraction the edges are brought together, and
the tissue solidifies.No villi or epithelium covers these cicatrices.{704} There are rarer pathological changes.In catarrh of long duration
cysts are found, especially in the large intestine.They are about the
size of a small pea, projecting above the mucous surface.They have a
yellow or amber color, and contain a jelly-like yellow fluid which can
be pressed out.They originate in the distension of the dilating glands
of Lieberkuhn; according to Woodward, they find a favorable nidus for
their growth in the softening tissue of the solitary glands; hence the
cystic forms are seen occupying the interior of follicles undergoing
disintegration.[21] The presence of the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
interior of the closed follicles has been observed by other
pathologists, some of whom are unable to explain so remarkable a
lesion.[22] Around the edges or in the midst of healing ulcers in the
intestine granulation-like excrescences or polypoid growths are
observed as a rare lesion.These seem to be projections from
undestroyed islands of mucous membrane, being surrounded by the
ulcerated surface.The minute polypi originate in a process of growth
of the undestroyed mucous tissue.Cicatricial contractions around their
bases give them peculiar forms; they are club-shaped, simple, or
branched.This lesion has been described by Johann Wagner,[23] Carl
Rokitansky,[24] and J. J. Woodward[25] from original specimens.According to Woodward, the growths (pseudo-polypi he calls them) are
composed of a central portion of connective tissue continuous with the
submucous connective tissue of the intestine and a peripheral portion
of diseased mucous membrane.The central connective tissue was filled
with large and numerous cells, and the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
mucous covering were elongated and branched and showed evidences of an
active hyperplasia.[Footnote 21: J. J. Woodward, _op.[Footnote 22: A. Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.[Footnote 23: "Einige Formen von Darmgeschwuren; iii., die

Jan., 1881, p.Polypi of the colon have been seen and figured by other pathologists,
but they were not connected with ulceration and cicatrization of
ulcers.Luschka[26] saw the mucous membrane from the ileo-caecal valve
to the end of the rectum covered with polypi, club-shaped, the size of
a hempseed or bean, and made up of glandular tubes simple or branched.Other cases have been described by Lebert, Heuriet, and others,[27] in
which polypi were distributed in the rectum, colon, caecum, or about
the ileo-caecal valve.This is the condition described by Virchow as
colitis polyposa.[Footnote 26: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.[Footnote 27: Heuriet, _Bull.xlviii.,

being normal or in a state of chronic catarrh.of the cases examined either in the large or small intestine.The
caecum is the most frequent seat; next in the order of frequency it is
seen in the ascending {705} colon, the lower part of the ileum, the
other parts of the colon, and is least common in the upper part of the
ileum.In children the lesion is more common in the small intestine
than in adults.The changes in the mucous membrane of the colon are a
diminution in its thickness and disappearance of the glands of
Lieberkuhn.The mucous layer is reduced to one-fifth of its normal
size, and no trace of the glands may be left; a layer of connective
tissue with imbedded round cells is all that remains.The surface of
the membrane is irregular and  with yellowish pigment.In the
ileum the villi are shrunken, with few cells; in some cases they
disappear altogether.The muscular tunic may share in the atrophy.[28]

membrane is met with in chronic catarrh.The small arteries of the
villi and submucous layer, the muscular and other tissues, are
infiltrated with a new material allied to fibrin.The membrane to the
eye is paler than normal.When iodine is applied, a characteristic red
staining of the infiltrated parts is noticed.This lesion is a cause of
diarrhoea and of hemorrhage,[29] from the greater permeability and
greater fragility of the arteries.It is also associated with
follicular ulceration, and is probably a cause of disintegration of the
mucous membrane.[30]

catarrh, few of which have any distinctive character.The peritoneum
shows signs of old or recent inflammation.The former is subacute or
chronic, and is recognized by the adhesions of opposed surfaces in a
limited area, frequently corresponding to the seat of intense
intestinal inflammation.Fatal perforations are delayed or prevented by
these adhesions.General peritonitis with soft lymph or sero-purulent
effusion is found with perforation.The mesenteric glands may be
enlarged.The liver is larger or sometimes smaller than normal, and its
tissue is softened and may be fatty.Abscess of the liver[31] is a very
rare result of chronic intestinal catarrh, with ulceration.The
gall-bladder is usually filled with bile.The spleen is small and firm
in texture; less commonly it is soft and friable.The kidneys are large and pale; the cortical substance is
relatively increased and the tubules contain granular epithelium.[Footnote 31: It occurred in 4 per cent.of Woodward's cases of chronic
follicular ulceration.See case reported by the writer in which the
ulcers healed before the death of the patient from hepatic abscess
(_Maryland Med.Journ._, March 15, 1883, p.In the thorax the heart is flabby, pale, and small; clots are found in
the right and left side extending into the pulmonary artery and aorta.Sudden death has been attributed to cardiac thrombosis.That coagula
{706} do form in the heart during life is shown by the sudden
occurrence of cerebral embolism with aphasia.[32]

[Footnote 32: The writer has seen one case of this kind occurring
during the effort at stool in a patient who was very feeble and very
anaemic from chronic intestinal inflammation with ulceration.]Pneumonia is the most frequent pulmonary lesion; it may be single or
double.It was found in 18 of the 99 cases of Woodward, and in 21 out
of H. A. Allen's 41 cases.Inflammation of the pleura is not
infrequent.The brain and its membranes may be congested, and fluid is
found in the subarachnoid space, in some instances in cases which have
had a sudden termination.The cornea is ulcerated, and the eye
destroyed by opening of the anterior chamber in a small proportion of
cases.The sloughing process begins in the lower part of the cornea and
in the sclerotic.SYMPTOMS.--When chronic intestinal catarrh succeeds the acute form, the
transition is marked by the disappearance of fever and an amelioration
of all the symptoms, with apparent recovery.The patient begins to go
about, but diarrhoea returns whenever there is any unusual fatigue or
excess in eating.In some cases there is no improvement in the
diarrhoea, but in the general symptoms only.When the malady is chronic
from the beginning, the onset is characterized by symptoms of
indigestion and occasional diarrhoea, which become more and more
pronounced according to the severity of the illness.Mild forms of catarrh have constipation, or diarrhoea alternates with a
normal or constipated state of the bowels.The form in which
constipation is continuous is associated with mechanical stasis from
liver and heart lesions and with the gouty and uric-acid diathesis.The
mucous membrane is in a state of passive hyperaemia, an excess of mucus
being the product of the inflammatory process.Mucus coats the lining
tunic, lessens its irritability, interferes with digestion and
absorption, and acts as a ferment, exciting decomposition in the food.The bowel is atonic and is distended with contained gas; there is great
feebleness of peristaltic contractions.Intestinal indigestion and constipation are therefore the symptoms of
this form.The signs of indigestion occur one to three hours after
eating, according to the location of the maximum of catarrh and the
time taken by the food to reach this point.They are a sense of fulness
or distress in the abdomen from gaseous distension, slight colicky
pains, and a rumbling of gas, which may be prolonged during several
hours after a meal.The constipation is indicated by the spontaneous
passage of dry masses or scybalae coated with layers of mucus which are
clear or cloudy, or the mucus may be intimately mixed with solid
matter.Pure mucus is also expelled without fecal matter.There may be
no stool without a purgative, and then softened matter with scybalae
and mucus is passed.Altered mucus in the form of membraniform shreds
or cylinders occasionally pass in the so-called membranous enteritis.The abdomen is full and not sensitive to pressure.The tongue is coated
and usually pale and flabby.In appearance the patient exhibits a
general want of tone; the skin is white or muddy, the muscles are soft,
and the expression indicates the depression of spirits, the lassitude,
and the inertia which he feels.Hemorrhoids are very likely to {707}
exist.Such a condition may last for months or years without much
change.Under proper treatment recovery may take place, but if entirely
neglected or improperly treated the disease inevitably becomes worse.In a second mild form there is no permanent disease, only an
impressionability of the mucous membrane of the bowel to causes which
induce hyperaemia and excessive secretion ending in diarrhoea.Exposure
to cold, fatigue, or slight indiscretions in diet may bring it on; even
an emotional cause may do it.The attacks last one or several days, and
may at times assume some gravity.This predisposition to diarrhoea
lasting through a lifetime is analogous to the tendency to inflammation
of the nasal and other mucous membranes.In severer and typical forms the symptoms point to permanent lesions.The tongue is smooth, shining, or glazed, sometimes with a central
brown streak, but it may be also pale and covered with a white coat.The appetite is diminished or lost, or it is capricious, craving
unsuitable food.If there is no gastric catarrh, the chief distress
does not come until some hours after eating, but the taking of food
sometimes excites pain and brings on an evacuation of the bowels
through reflex influence.There may be slight tympanites or a retracted abdomen.The imperfect
digestion of food and the fermentation of the intestinal contents
develop gas which keeps the abdomen distended and causes slight pains
and borborygmi.A feeling of
abdominal soreness is not unusual; it is increased by coughing,
sneezing, or any sudden movement.Sensibility to pressure is usually
wanting; when it exists it is found along the line of the colon in most
cases.The number of the stools
varies from one to eight in twenty-four hours; four is about the
average number.They occur usually in the early morning hours, from two
to six o'clock, but food may at any time bring on peristaltic
contraction, so that a motion after every meal is not uncommon.In
quantity there is much variability; two to four ounces of fluid matter
is the rule perhaps, but a very much larger amount than this is often
passed with each evacuation.As a rule, the larger the quantity of
fluid the more extensive is the catarrh and the more advanced are the
lesions.The matters passed are composed chiefly of fecal matter
varying in consistence from a solid or semi-solid mass to a watery
fluid.In the soft stool, like thickened gruel, the consistence is due
to the presence of mucus; in the thinner evacuation water is the chief
element.In color the dejecta are
brown, yellow, red, green, slate-color, or white.They may be 
dark by medicines, as iron or bismuth, or by blood.The presence of
blood gives a pinkish, bright-red, dark-brown, or black color,
depending upon the amount of blood and the changes it has undergone in
the bowel from a longer or shorter retention.Blood, when it comes from
the rectum, is in bright-red streaks or small coagula.When its source
is higher up, it is much altered, being dark and granular.Coffee-ground sediment in a fluid stool is blood from the upper part of
the intestine or stomach.The spreading of an ulcer may open a vessel
of some size, and a fatal hemorrhage follow.A yellow tint like that of
a child's movement may arise from a mixture of pus and fecal matter.Pus, as a milky or creamy fluid which may be {708} streaked with blood,
is a frequent appearance in disease of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The odor of the stools is fecal, sour, or sickening from fermentation
or offensive from decomposition.In bad forms of chronic diarrhoea in
children the black watery stools have a most offensive odor.Mucus is the most constant ingredient of the diarrhoeal stool, and is
in itself a sufficient evidence of catarrh, as it is not seen in normal
stools except as a temporary phenomenon.It is present in flakes in
watery evacuations, giving a jelly-like character to the fluid if it is
in excess, or it is mixed with semi-solid feces.Pure mucus may be
passed, if the catarrh is low down, in clear, glairy, or opaque masses.The frog's-egg or boiled-sago particles supposed by Niemeyer and others
to point to follicular ulceration, and by Traube to be the swallowed
bronchial secretion, are said by Virchow to be partly-digested starch,
and also by Nothnagel to be of vegetable nature.[33] The stools may
contain small yellow or brownish masses which are mucoid in nature,
being yellow from bile-staining.Pavement epithelial cells are found in
the coating of mucus around a hard fecal lump.Cylindrical epithelium
is passed uncolored or stained with bile.These cells are separated,
and are deformed and shrunken, with a granular protoplasm and
indistinct nucleus.Round cells in the form
of mucus-corpuscles or giant-cells are mixed with shreds of mucus or
float in the thin stools.Crystals of triple phosphate, of neutral
phosphate, oxalate of lime, and other lime salts, and of cholesterin,
are also seen.[Footnote 33: _Virchow's Archiv_, v. S.329; Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der
Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift fur klin.Med._, iii., 1881, p.Micrococci and bacteria have no pathological importance; they are seen
in different diseases and in health.Unaltered food may be expelled (lientery) by rapid peristaltic
movements.But the microscope will detect what cannot be seen by the
eye--unaltered starch-granules, filaments of meat-fibre, or fat in
drops or in needle-shaped or feathery crystals.The nervous system is disturbed after a certain time.There is languor,
with depression of spirits, mental weariness, and inaptitude for work
of any kind.The patient is querulous, morose; his sleep is restless,
but sometimes profound until disturbed by the demand to empty the
bowel.Melancholia is attributed to this as to other diseases of the
abdomen, but their influence in producing insanity is doubtful.[34]

[Footnote 34: Griesinger, _Mental Path.ed., New
York, 1882, pp.No decided symptoms are exhibited in the respiratory and circulatory
systems.Even slight exertion will cause shortness of breath and
increased frequency or palpitation of the heart.This irritability of
the heart is a marked feature of the disease.[35]

[Footnote 35: DaCosta found that of 200 cases of irritable heart, 61
were in patients who had suffered from or still had diarrhoea (_Am.The appearance of the urine is normal; it may be abundant, with
phosphatic deposit, or it is scanty and high-.In bad cases
albumen and casts have been found.[36]

[Footnote 36: Alonzo Clark, "Proc.The symptom indicative of atrophy of the mucous membrane is believed by
Nothnagel to be the persistent passage of one soft, unformed stool
daily.Mucus and fat, which diminish the consistence of the stool, are
{709} excluded by microscopical examination.One stool daily shows that
there is no exaggerated peristalsis which hurries the food along so
rapidly that water cannot be absorbed.[37]

[Footnote 37: Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift
fur klin.Med._, iv., 1882, p.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--As the disease advances it is marked by
progressive emaciation and debility.The skin gradually acquires great
pallor, indicating profound anaemia.An exacerbation of the disease will in a few days cause the cheeks to
grow hollow, the eyes to appear sunken with dark rings around them.In
all cases of long duration the progress is intermittent; frequent
relapses occur from which the patient may rally and regain a moderate
degree of flesh.Recovery may take place in weeks or months--eighteen
months is the average duration[38]--but in most instances a tendency to
a recurrence of the diarrhoea from cold, fatigue, or indiscretions in
diet will continue throughout life.An incomplete recovery may take
place by the cessation of the diarrhoea and formation of a stricture
from the healing of an intestinal ulcer.In the worst cases there is no
rule as to the rapidity or regularity of the march of the disease.[Footnote 38: C. H. Ralfe, Seamen's Hospital, London: see Aitken's
_Handbook of Treatment_, New York, 1882, p.When the advance is toward a fatal issue the emaciation progresses
until it becomes extreme; nothing but skin and bone are left.The
cuticle is hard and dry, pale or brownish in color.The muscular
strength is so reduced that the patient is unable to move from bed.The nervous depression and moroseness
assumes a more marked character.Among the soldiers during the Civil
War who had undergone great privations with insufficient or improper
diet the mental phenomena were those of dementia.[39] In them the
disease was modified also by the symptoms of scurvy and malarial
poisoning.[Footnote 39: W. Kempler, "Entero-Colitis," _Am.Fever is seen in the late stages; it is nocturnal at first, and later
assumes the features of hectic.The pulse grows more frequent and
thready; aphthous deposits appear on the inside of the mouth and
pharynx.Toward the end the discharges may become more frequent and
very abundant; they are more fluid, lighter  or black, with
floating particles of blood and mucus.There may be a loss of odor or
they may have a cadaveric smell.Death takes place in a few weeks or after years of alternate suffering
and relief.The immediate causes of death are exhaustion, marasmus from
starvation, collapse from perforation of an intestinal ulcer and
consecutive peritonitis, syncope from sudden exertion, pneumonia, or
acute pulmonary congestion, pleurisy, or subarachnoid effusion in the
brain, with coma and convulsions.COMPLICATIONS.--General dropsy results from the hydraemia and languid
circulation of the late period of the disease.Other causes of this
symptom are coincident diseases of the liver, kidney, or the malarial
cachexia.Oedema of one extremity follows a thrombus in the crural
vein.Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary phthisis are sometimes met with.Acute pneumonia[40] and acute pulmonary congestion are occasional {710}
causes of death.Peritonitis may occur with and without perforation.The latter variety begins as a local inflammation of subacute or
chronic nature, and spreads slowly until it becomes general.Extensive
adhesions and abundant accumulations of serous, sero-purulent, or
purulent fluid in the abdominal cavity result.[Footnote 40: Pneumonia (8 double and 12 single) occurred in 20 out of
41 fatal cases reported by Harrison Allen, _Tr.Philada._,
1867, vol.The causal conditions which have been enumerated may be considered as
complications.They are tuberculosis, Bright's disease, cirrhosis of
the liver, abdominal tumors, scurvy, tubercular and other neoplasms in
the wall of the intestine; attacks of intercurrent, intermittent, or
remittent fever arise from the malarial influence to which the
intestinal catarrh is due.These fevers and rheumatism and
pseudo-rheumatism are complications in soldiers from the exposure to
malarial influences and to cold and dampness.[41]

[Footnote 41: Woodward, _op.Ulceration of the cornea, escape of the aqueous humor, and collapse of
the eye were observed in quite a number of cases occurring among
soldiers.[42]

[Footnote 42: Elliot Coues, _Med.Reporter_, Philada., 1863,
vol.207, and H. Allen, _Tr.SEQUELAE.--The alteration of structure from long-standing inflammation
leaves the mucous membrane prone to recurrence of inflammation.Chronic
intestinal indigestion and permanent malnutrition come from the same
cause.The glandular and lymphatic structures of the intestine and the
mesenteric glands are so changed by disease that they imperfectly
perform their function.Tabes mesenterica is the ultimate phase of this
change.Constipation succeeds chronic diarrhoea, and is due to atony of
the muscular wall from long-continued distension, and probably from
degeneration of the muscular structure.A more serious cause of
constipation, and sometimes of intestinal obstruction, is found in
stenosis of the bowel from the healing of the ulcers of long-standing
chronic catarrh.Stricture is more common in the colon, sigmoid
flexure, and rectum.How frequently such a result follows the
cicatrization of intestinal ulcers is not definitely known.Woodward
concludes from a careful search of books and pathological museums that
stenosis from this cause is very rare.[43] Syphilis is the most common
cause of ulcer.Local or general peritonitis leads to the formation of
adhesions or fibrous bands uniting neighboring links of intestine.By
the contracting of these narrowing of the intestinal canal may result.Paralysis, hemiplegia, paraplegia, etc.have been found to follow upon
diarrhoea of long standing.[44]

[Footnote 43: Woodward, _op.[Footnote 44: Potain, "Paresie des Membres inferieurs ayant succede a
un Catarrhe gastro-intestinal," _Rev.Med.-Chir._, Paris,
1880, xlvii.562; "Paralysis spinale secondaire a une Diarrhee
chronique," _Journ.Prat._, Paris, 1880, 3, S. ii.DIAGNOSIS.--The mild form of chronic catarrh of the intestines
associated with constipation has been confounded with hepatic
disorders, and the obscure symptoms attending it have been attributed
to excess or diminution of bile, and medicines to regulate the liver
have been given accordingly.In the absence of lesions in the liver, in
cases where symptoms such as have been described have preceded death,
the opinion is not justified that disease of this organ has existed.On
the contrary, alteration in the mucous membrane is almost always found,
which points to the true nature of the disease.The diagnosis is based
upon the accompanying {711} gastric catarrh and upon the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion and malnutrition.Greater sensibility to
pressure over the right hypochondrium and along the line of the colon,
pain one to two hours after eating, with distension of the abdomen, the
passage of well-formed and somewhat indurated feces mixed or coated
with mucus, are symptoms peculiar to these mild forms.The tendency to diarrhoea from cold, indigestible food, etc.which
marks the second form of mild catarrh is easily recognized.The characteristic symptom of the severe form is the persistent
diarrhoea.Paroxysmal pains, tympanites and rumbling of gas, tenderness
on pressure over the colon, the alternate periods of improvement and
relapse, with the constitutional signs of impaired nutrition and
progressive anaemia and debility, point out the nature and the seat of
the lesion with sufficient clearness.It is futile to attempt to
distinguish chronic intestinal diarrhoea from chronic dysentery.The
lesions of the two conditions are essentially the same; it depends upon
the fancy as to which name is given to the lesions described here under
the title chronic intestinal catarrh.A greater amount of blood and
mucus in the stool with tenesmus would more properly be called
dysenteric, but the same case may present at one time diarrhoeal, at
another dysenteric, symptoms.Primary must be distinguished from secondary diarrhoea.Therefore the
liver, heart, and lungs must be examined to discover diseases which
might cause portal congestion.Any constitutional malady may be a cause
and an explanation: tuberculosis or pulmonary phthisis stands first in
its influence; next, chronic Bright's disease, septicaemia, scurvy,
syphilis, and gout are attended by intercurrent diarrhoea.If all
general disease can be excluded and the morbid process be located in
the intestine alone, its cause may be known by studying the habits,
occupation, and diet of the patient.Foreign bodies--hardened feces,
gall-stones, fruit-stones, etc.--are possible causes which the history
of the case may point to.Having located the disease in the intestine and decided upon its
primary or secondary nature, it remains to determine more precisely
(_a_) the locality of the lesion, and (_b_) the stage of the
inflammatory process.(_a_) In what part of the intestinal canal is the disease located?It
must be remembered that in typical and fatal cases the large intestine
is the home par excellence of the lesions of chronic catarrh, and that
the lower part of the ileum is often associated in the morbid
processes, but limited areas of the small or large intestine are
affected in mild forms which yield readily to treatment.Icterus, clay- stools, and bile in the urine show that the
catarrh is in the duodenum and involves the opening of the common
bile-duct.The absence of diarrhoea, with flatulence and colics, limits
the area of inflammation to the duodenum.Symptoms of duodenal
indigestion accompany this form of catarrh; the failure of bile to
neutralize the acid chyme impairs the effect of the pancreatic
secretion.Fats are not digested and there is fatty diarrhoea.To this
may be added tenderness in the right hypochondrium, and pain and
oppression in the epigastrium and to the right one hour after eating.There may be wasting and hypochondriasis.{712} The lower part of the duodenum below the opening of the
bile-duct, the jejunum, and the ileum can be taken together as forming
the small intestine.Chronic catarrh of the small intestine is attended
with pain about the umbilicus, which comes on immediately or in one
hour after taking food.Tympanitic distension gives a full, rounded
prominence to the abdomen, which is more central than lateral, and
greater below the umbilicus than above it.It is accompanied by a sense
of oppression, which is greater after eating.Inability to digest food
consisting largely of starch or sugar, as well as tardiness in the
digestion of all foods, with resulting loss of flesh, are signs of
intestinal indigestion.There may be no diarrhoea; if there is,
important help to diagnosis can be gained by examining the stools.They
contain undigested or partly-altered meat-fibre and starch-granules,
discoverable only by the microscope.The discharges are soft and pulpy
from an intimate admixture of mucus.To the naked eye no mucus is
visible, but a thin layer under the microscope shows clear islets of
pure mucus, or mucus may only be detected by the adhesion of the
covering-glass to the slide.Bile-stained epithelium and globules of
stained mucus are seen in the liquid stools from catarrh of the small
intestine and of the ascending colon.There is the characteristic
reaction and play of color on testing for bile-pigment.These are
evidences that the stool with the bile has been hurried along the ileum
and colon, and expelled before the transformation in the coloring
matter has had time to take place.[45]

[Footnote 45: "II.Abtheilung, Diagnostische Bemerkungen zur
Localisation der Catarrhe," _Zeitschrift fur klinische Medicin_,
Berlin, 1882, iv.In catarrh of the large intestine there is sensitiveness to pressure
along the line of the colon; the distension of the abdomen is not
uniform, depending upon the prominence of the transverse or descending
colon.The pains are more severe and precede the stools, which are more
frequent and larger than in catarrh of the ileum.The discharges are
pulpy or watery.Globules of mucus are visible to the naked eye, and
mucus is intimately mixed with fecal matter.If the lower half of the colon is chiefly the seat of the disease, pure
mucus coats the more solid stool and is in its substance.With catarrh
limited to the descending colon scybalae are imbedded in mucus.From
the sigmoid flexure and rectum larger masses of mucus, without fecal
matter or with it, are expelled.Pure lumps of mucus, mixed or stained
with red blood and without fecal matter, indicate catarrh of the
rectum--proctitis.(_b_) The stage of the process of inflammation is diagnosed by the
condition of the patient, the course of the disease, and the character
of the stools.As long as there is a pulpy fecal diarrhoea, with no
blood, pus, or fragments of tissue and no marked emaciation or fever,
and with a tendency to improvement under favorable conditions, there is
every reason to believe that there is no ulceration.In follicular ulceration the course of the disease is essentially
chronic, and is marked by periods of improvement under careful
treatment, with exacerbations and relapses from slight causes of
irritation.There is progressive emaciation and debility, with fever of
hectic character, which is worse in the later stages.The movements are frequent and liquid, and are without
odor or fetid.They {713} contain mucus, glassy-gray or green,
pus-cells imbedded in masses of mucus, blood in small amount, but
sometimes abundant, and shreds of the tissue of the mucous membrane.The higher the ulcer the less marked is the diarrhoea.The lower its
situation the greater is the frequency of the stools and the more
liable are they to be accompanied by tenesmus and to contain blood and
pus.Toward the last, ulceration is accompanied by rapid emaciation,
fever, sweats, a feeble circulation, a dry tongue, great thirst, and
oedema of the feet and ankles.Death takes place by gradual exhaustion,
more rarely from perforation and peritonitis or from intestinal
hemorrhage.[46]

[Footnote 46: Nothnagel, "Die Symptomatologie der Darmgeschwure,"
_Klinische Vortrage Volkmann_, No.Duodenal ulcer is with difficulty recognized during life.[47] The
following are the symptoms which have preceded death from this lesion:
Profuse hemorrhage from the bowel, vomiting of food as well as blood,
icterus, dysphagia, hiccough, oppression in the epigastrium after
eating, attacks of cardialgia with tenderness on pressure in the right
hypochondrium, and sudden death with symptoms of collapse.If these
symptoms follow an extensive burn of the skin, they are easily referred
to a duodenal ulcer.[Footnote 47: W. L. Loomis, "Perforating Ulcer of Duodenum and Sudden
Death."For two years the patient had suffered with dyspepsia and
epigastric pain after eating, was gouty, and had lost flesh.Autopsy:
atheroma of arteries, beginning cirrhosis of kidneys, walls of stomach
thickened, perforated ulcer one inch below pylorus (_Med.Record New
York_, 1879, vol.188; also _Boston City Hospital Report_, 1882,
p.Tuberculous ulcers are distinguished from follicular ulcers by the
history of hereditary predisposition, the existence of pulmonary
tuberculosis, higher fever, and more rapid emaciation and debility.A cancerous ulcer may be the cause of bloody stools; it is usually
within reach of the finger in the rectum; the mass exercises pressure
upon the prostate, and at times occludes the bowel, causing
obstruction.The cachexia and rapid decline are not seen in catarrhal
ulceration.PROGNOSIS.--Chronic catarrh of the intestine is most fatal in children.Among infants artificially fed, when the illness develops and continues
during hot weather, the mortality is very great.Recovery in the young
is rendered less probable if chronic diarrhoea is associated with
rickets, scrofula, or tuberculosis.If the catarrh in adults is a complication of some previously existing
constitutional disease, as Bright's disease or scurvy, or is connected
with lesions of the liver, spleen, heart, or lungs, there is less hope
of cure.In old persons this disease has a special gravity.The longer the disease has lasted before treatment is begun, and the
longer it continues without being influenced by treatment, the more
unfavorable will be the prognosis.Discouraging symptoms are an
uninterrupted loss of flesh and strength, lientery, hectic fever,
relapses notwithstanding care in diet, and the signs of
ulceration--blood, pus, and tissue-shreds in the stools, with an odor
of decomposition.Favorable promises may be based upon a hearty willingness of the
patient to submit to the strictest regimen and to subordinate his life
to the plans of treatment, the absence of other diseases, early
improvement in his general condition and local symptoms under rest and
diet.A {714} complete cure cannot be assumed to exist unless the
patient has passed one or more years without a relapse.TREATMENT.--As chronic intestinal catarrh is a complication of so many
conditions, the prevention of it becomes a matter of great importance
and of very general application.All rules for preserving
health--temperance in eating and drinking, bathing, exercise, good
ventilation, the avoidance of overwork, both mental and physical--are
so many means for escaping an intestinal catarrh which may present
itself as an indigestion with constipation or as a diarrhoea.The special liability of infants and children, and to a less extent of
very old persons, and the greater dangers they run, call for the most
careful selection of appropriate diet at these periods of life.Where there is hereditary predisposition, idiosyncrasy, chronic
diseases of organs, or constitutional diseases, an easily-digested
dietary should be supplemented by precautions against chilling of the
surface by the wearing of flannel underclothing and woollen socks.The etiology of each case may at once suggest a line of treatment.Among the causes which point to appropriate measures are--the continued
presence in the bowel of indigestible or undigested food, constant
exposure to cold or to changes of temperature, chronic cardiac disease
and portal congestion from any cause, chronic cachexiae, as syphilis,
malaria, tuberculosis, or Bright's disease, the crowding together of
individuals in prisons, asylums, etc.The mildest form of intestinal catarrh characterized by intestinal
indigestion and constipation or by the passage of fecal matter more or
less solid, mixed or coated with mucus, is best treated by a diet such
as is advised for intestinal indigestion, bathing with friction,
outdoor life, exercise on horseback or by walking, pleasurable
occupations, and travel.Iron if there is anaemia, and strychnia if
there is a sluggish capillary circulation, with cold hands and feet,
are available and useful in many cases.Massage and the Swedish
movement treatment find useful application in feeble men and in women
who are not strong enough for outdoor exercise.To aid the digestion
the liquor pancreaticus as advised by Roberts, a teaspoonful one hour
and a half to two hours after each meal, with ten to twenty grains of
the bicarbonate of sodium, is, theoretically at least, to be warmly
recommended.The Rockbridge alum water, a small glass three times daily
between meals, has astringency enough for the hyperaemic membrane and
is of good service without increasing constipation.Purgatives should be avoided as much as possible.An enema of cool
water, not more than a tumblerful, taken each morning after breakfast
if persevered in, may do all that is needed in this direction.If it
fails to empty the bowel completely, a larger enema of warm water--one
pint--holding in solution sulphate of zinc or alum in the strength of
one grain to three or four ounces, can be thrown high up with a rubber
tube once daily.This acts upon the mucous surface, constringes mildly
the congested vessels, and when expelled brings away the retained fecal
matter.These astringent rectal injections offer promise of cure in
many obstinate cases where the colon is chiefly the seat of disease.Belladonna is advised for cases of this kind in combination with
strychnia for the constipation.Bedford mineral water, Hunyadi water, or other salines and the less
active vegetable {715} cathartics, can be given alternately.Ipecacuanha has had quite a reputation in combination with purgatives
in intestinal catarrh.Aloin pills empty the bowel without much
attendant irritation.The form of catarrh which shows itself in a tendency to diarrhoea
from indiscretions in diet or from exposure to cold must receive
prophylactic treatment.Especially in this form is it important to
improve the activity of the skin by bathing and friction, and to lead a
temperate life in all things, regulating the diet according to the
rules already stated.Fowler's
solution of arsenic (one drop before each meal, Ringer), the
potassio-tartrate or the tincture of the chloride of iron, dilute
sulphuric acid, nitro-muriatic or hydrochloric acid, are efficient in
improving digestive activity or in opposing the anaemia which is nearly
always present.Quinia is indicated in malarial anaemia with a
disposition to loose bowels.Quassia or other vegetable bitters can be
given if the appetite is languid; the bitters are, as a rule, of little
benefit, and may do harm if diarrhoea exists.Strychnia with quassia or
columbo stimulates the appetite and the gastric digestion.When
intercurrent attacks of diarrhoea come on with coated tongue,
flatulence, distress about the umbilicus after eating, bismuth given on
an empty stomach in full doses is serviceable.Small doses of morphia
or of opium in some form can be added to the bismuth if there is much
pain or when the stools are frequent.In this and in other forms of intestinal catarrh mineral waters are
profitably employed.They are best taken at their sources; and here, as
in the case of sea-bathing, the benefit is largely due to the change of
air and scene and to the more simple mode of life.Any of the
watering-places where alkaline-saline waters or ferruginous waters are
found may be of benefit.A trip to Europe and a stay at Carlsbad will
break up many an obstinate case of chronic abdominal disorder; but
other beneficial waters in Europe are Tarosp, Rohitsch, Marienbad,
Kissengen, and Plombieres.In this country the comfort and conveniences of the summer hotels and
climate are as much to be considered as the chemical composition of the
waters.For milder forms of catarrh with constipation a season at
Saratoga, with a life of temperance there, is a wise procedure.Bedford
Springs, Pa., offer the same advantages in part, but the waters are
best suited to catarrh with constipation.Many of the Virginia springs
benefit health-seekers who do not place too much reliance upon the
virtues of the waters, and who trust to the value of pure air,
exercise, diversion, and rest.All plans of treatment for the more severe form of catarrh with
chronic diarrhoea (follicular enteritis) must be based upon a knowledge
of the lesions.Bearing in mind the alterations in the mucous and
submucous tissues, it is clear that no treatment can be successful
which is not carried out with the most careful attention to details,
and which is not continued for some time after all the symptoms of the
disease have ceased.The complete resolution of hypertrophied glandular
tissue, the scattering of cell-accumulations, and the healing of ulcers
can only be secured in this way.It is best to present the whole case
before the patient, so as to enlist in the task his intelligent
co-operation.Directions for the guidance of cases of this kind must include every
{716} detail of the patient's life.The question of residence is of
importance to begin with.A cool and dry climate is better than a wet
and warm one, and where other means fail change of climate is sometimes
the only cure.A sea-voyage, a residence in a mountain-region, will
oftentimes promptly and effectually cure an obstinate diarrhoea.House-drainage and ventilation should be examined into and improved.The occupation may have developed the disease; in overwork may lie the
origin and the cause of its continuance.Rest from work is therefore in
some instances the one thing needed.In all cases the energies and the
brain should not be overtaxed.The bath to keep the skin active can be
combined with friction.The hot bath, as hot as can be borne, is the
best.It is a stimulant, not a depressant, as is the tepid bath, and it
is safer than the cold bath.The cold sitz bath or the application of cold compresses diminishes
abdominal plethora, and is wisely advised in strong persons who are not
depressed or chilled by external cold.Sea-bathing is another
hydro-therapeutic measure which is of unquestioned advantage in all
forms of intestinal catarrh.Permanent baths have been found very serviceable in many chronic
diseases, and there are many reasons for advising them in obstinate
diarrhoeas.There can be no better means for bringing to bear a strong
and continued influence upon the intestinal mucous membrane.The
patient should be kept in the warm bath for one, two, or three weeks,
according to his strength and the effect upon the disease.Systematic
hot bathing under the direction of a physician at Richfield, Sharon,
the Hot Springs of Virginia or Arkansas, is an invaluable aid.Rest in the recumbent position for cases where the symptoms indicate
marked tissue-alteration is very often the most important part of the
treatment.Rest and diet are alone necessary to cure many cases, and
without these combined means relief is often impossible.The rest
should be absolute, the patient using a bed-pan and lying down all the
time.The contraindications for this method are a slight diarrhoea
which yields to other treatment, and loss of strength and appetite from
the deprivation of air and exercise.If rest is not advisable, or does no good after a fair trial of two to
four weeks, outdoor life in fair weather by driving or walking slowly
can be suggested.A long drive will bring back a diarrhoea which has
taken many weeks to relieve.The rules for diet must be clearly given and strictly enforced.An
exclusive milk diet should have a trial in every case.Skimmed milk can
be taken in larger quantities and with less repulsion, and is therefore
to be preferred.The exclusive milk diet can be varied with buttermilk,
koumiss, or wine-whey; and fruit-juices, as orange-juice, lime-juice,
or tamarind-water, please the patient without doing harm.In the case
of adults as well as children the milk is made more digestible by
diluting it with barley- or rice-water or by adding transformed
farinaceous food to milk in the form of Mellin's food and other foods
of this class.Animal broths, as chicken-soup and beef-tea, are well digested if
properly made and given in small quantities.Raw meat scraped, beef or
mutton rare and thoroughly masticated, the breast of poultry, game,
broiled fish, raw oysters, raw or very slightly boiled eggs, or
sweetbread, are foods from which selection can be made to add variety
to the dietary.{717} Saccharine, starchy, and fatty foods are to be
given as little as possible.Vegetables may be added to the list as the
condition improves.Rice and fine hominy (grits) are to be thought of
first, as being easily digested and nourishing.Good wine in moderation
is not hurtful; the red wines diluted with water are the best, but good
port, tokay, and whiskey well diluted find application in particular
cases.Whatever food be given, it should be taken in the quantities and at
hours prescribed by the physician, who by careful inspection of the
stools judges of the necessity of changes in his regulations and of the
success of his treatment.The further treatment of chronic diarrhoea has for its object by the
aid of drugs to change the anatomical state of the mucous membrane.Manifestly, the choice depends upon the state of this tissue.In the
earlier stages the increased vascularity and hypersecretion call for
mild astringents or for medicines which are believed empirically to
oppose these conditions.When drugs can be dispensed with, it is better
to do so; they should always be made subordinate to the careful regimen
already described.Bismuth in large doses (ten to thirty grains) is a safe and efficacious
remedy in this stage.Nitrate of silver in pill form (one-sixth to
one-fourth of a grain) has the endorsement of Wm.Pepper and many other
practitioners.It should be continued for two or three weeks at least,
but it may be given in small doses during several months, with
intermissions, without danger of silver staining.[48]

[Footnote 48: A case is recorded of silver staining of the skin after
four weeks' administration (Woodward, _op.A routine administration of any drug or class of drugs is
reprehensible, and from the numerous remedies which are advocated in
chronic diarrhoea selection can be made for trial in the course of
intractable cases.The list would include sulphate of copper
(one-fourth to one-half a grain), the liquid preparations of iron
(liquor ferri nitratis, tinct.ferri chloridi), dilute nitric and
sulphuric acids, gallic acid and other vegetable astringents, oxide or
sulphate of zinc, alum, precipitated phosphate of calcium, salicin,
corrosive sublimate (1/100 gr.every hour), the Indian bael-fruit, etc.No remedy should be abandoned until it has been continuously given for
one or more weeks.alum water is markedly astringent, is not
unpleasant, and may be used as a substitute for water with advantage.In fact, there is no better way of introducing in quantity a mild
astringent into the intestine than by the drinking of this water.Cold-water rectal irrigation has a sedative and astringent influence,
and when properly used is of great advantage to both children and
adults.[49] The patient should be placed in the proper position, and
the water made to enter the rectum as high up as possible.The number
of stools lessens almost immediately after this treatment, peristalsis
being inhibited thereby.[Footnote 49: A long rectal rubber tube, such as advised by
Surgeon-General Wales, U.S.N., serves this purpose well.]To the water used in irrigation astringents may be added in small
doses.Sulphate of zinc, sugar of lead, or alum may be given in this
way in the strength of one grain to four or six ounces of water.This
{718} method of treatment promises more and is more rational than the
internal administration of drugs.Opium and its preparations should be avoided except to control frequent
or watery discharges or to relieve pain, but it is not often that this
is called for if wiser measures are first employed.Any of the remedies
spoken of may be given in the form of suppositories with greater
advantage often than by the mouth.In that more severe class of cases called follicular ulceration, in
which the follicles are known to be ulcerated from a prolongation of
the illness, the obstinacy of the diarrhoea, the character of the
discharges, and the effect upon the general health, other measures are
to be adopted.The diet should be most strictly regulated and the
digestive power of the patient carefully studied.Cod-liver oil is
added with advantage to other foods if there is a lack of nutrition.Aids to gastric digestion are called for.The intestinal lesion is to be reached through the stomach or the
rectum.Nitrate of silver in small doses is more especially applicable,
and is to be preferred to all other drugs in this stage.It is to be
given in small doses and for several weeks.Turpentine and copaiba have something in their favor in ulceration.Ergot has been suggested, and where there is much hemorrhage from the
bowel may be prescribed.Irrigations with solutions of nitrate of silver seem to be a direct and
certain remedy in cases where ulceration has existed for a long time.Two and a half to three pints of distilled water, holding in solution
five grains of nitrate of silver, should be thrown up the rectum as
high as possible with a rubber tube; the effort should be made to
secure immediate exit to the fluid.This procedure is to be repeated
after the bowels are moved--once every day or every other day if the
rectum becomes irritable.[50]

CHOLERA MORBUS.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Cholera nostras, Sporadic cholera, European or English
cholera, Spasmodic cholera, Cholera biliosa, Passio cholerica,
Cholerhagia, Trousse-galant, Die Gallenruhr, Brechruhr.DEFINITION.--An affection of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane
characterized by violent abdominal pain, nausea, and sudden, violent,
and incessant vomiting, and by purging of a watery fluid containing
little albumen and bile; attended with spasms of the muscles of the
abdomen and extremities, a pinched and sunken countenance, pallor,
cyanosis, and coldness of the surface of the body; a feeble and rapid
pulse, oppressed respiration, and great restlessness; dryness of the
tongue, great thirst, and diminished or suppressed urinary secretion
and a state approaching collapse, which may rarely prove fatal, but is,
as a rule, followed by reaction.HISTORY.--The term cholera has been in use since the time of
Hippocrates, but he confounded with it every disease which seemed to
him to come from acridity or corruption of humors, as colics and
meteorism with constipation.[1] He well described cholera morbus in
saying that "it is a disease which appears in summer, due to imprudence
in eating, at the same time as intermittent fever."[2] If Celsus be
correct in deriving the name from [Greek: chole] "bile," and [Greek:
reo] "I flow," it is more applicable to the disease now under
consideration than to the Asiatic disease, as it is the bile which is
absent in the colorless rice-water discharges of Asiatic cholera.Trallian and Ruysch, however, ascribe it to [Greek: cholera] the
rain-gutter of a house.les Maladies aigues_, 19, ii.[Footnote 2: _Epidemies_, lib.In the Old Testament mention is made of a disease resembling cholera
morbus.[3] Its true pathogeny was known to Galen, and it was accurately
described by Celsus,[4] and Aretaeus[5] mentions the nature of the
discharges and its frequency among young people and children.des Maladies epidemiques_, Paris, 1825.]The first mention of epidemics was in the sixteenth century.Various
epidemics in 1695, 1717, and 1718 in Germany were probably cholera
morbus.Forestus[6] reports seven observations from 1559 to 1565 of
attacks due to indigestible food or drastic medicines.F. Hoffman,[7]
{720} J. Frank,[8] and L. Riviere speak of the benignity of the disease
as contrasting it with its apparently dangerous symptoms.[Footnote 6: _Opera Omnia_, Rothomagi, 1633, "De stomachi affectibus,"
lib.[Footnote 7: _Medicina rationalis systemica_, t. iv.[Footnote 8: _Praxeos medicae universae praecepta_, Leipzig, 1826, p.Sydenham's[9] description of the epidemics in England in 1669-72 is the
earliest account of the disease in modern literature, and it was he who
gave it the name cholera morbus.NATURE.--There prevails at the present time a great diversity of
opinion in regard to its nature; the want of uniformity in the
appearances presented by post-mortem examinations may in some measure
account for this.The present state of our knowledge, derived both from
pathological anatomy and a study of the symptoms, will not warrant a
positive opinion in regard to it.Niemeyer,[10] in common with most German and some French authors,
considers cholera morbus to be a variety of gastro-intestinal catarrh.Leube[11] thinks it a variety of gastric catarrh with simultaneous
inflammation of the intestines and running a peculiar course.It is
certainly not identical with the specific Asiatic disease, although in
some cases the symptoms and morbid anatomy are exactly similar, and any
differentiation is impossible.By some it is believed that cholera
morbus is due to surviving germs implanted by previous epidemics of
Asiatic cholera.[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, New York, 1876, vol.The slight changes found in some fatal cases would lead to the belief
that the effect of the exciting cause is something more than a
mechanical irritation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The sudden onset, rapid development of symptoms, and dangerous collapse
justify the theory that there must be some previous change in the
individual or some peculiar result of food-decomposition.The nervous
system may be so enfeebled by prolonged heat that an irritant quickly
destroys its equilibrium and brings about vaso-motor paralysis of the
intestinal vessels and abundant serum transudation.Or the irritation
may be specific, depending upon the development of poison germs in food
which has been subjected to heat influences.There is a close
relationship between cholera morbus and cholera infantum in their
etiology, symptoms, and pathology.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--The disease is more common in the
tropics, but is not confined to any climate.In temperate latitudes it
is more likely to occur in July and August, when the variation of
temperature between day and night is great, although the other months
of summer and autumn are not entirely exempt.It is said to be more
frequent and fatal in Southern Europe than in the northern and
temperate climates.In periods immediately preceding and following
epidemics of Asiatic cholera many persons are attacked, although there
is great liability to errors in diagnosis at these times.It occurs more frequently in youth and adolescence than in advanced
life, and males seem to be more liable to attacks than females, but
difference in occupation may assist in this predisposition.Persons
endowed with an extreme sensibility of the nervous system and who are
subject to frequent attacks of intestinal catarrh are much more liable
to the disease.The exhaustion of the nervous system by heat, which is
the {721} probable explanation of the phenomena of cholera infantum,
has no doubt much to do with the development of cholera morbus.Mental
anxiety or overwork in summer increases this nerve-exhaustion and
renders the termini of nerves and the centres very susceptible to
peculiar irritation.Exciting Causes.--It is probable that the cause of most attacks is a
septic material generated in the fermentation and decomposition of
food.This poison acts as an irritant upon the gastric and intestinal
nerves and gives rise to excessive peristaltic movements and vomiting.Hence the quality of the food is an element of more importance in the
causation than the mere quantity ingested; and herein may reside the
chief difference between cholera morbus and Asiatic cholera, the latter
being due to a specific, imported, or acclimated poison which
invariably produces the same specific form in those exposed to its
action.[12] Unripe fruits, partially cooked or decaying meats and
vegetables, shellfish and fish some time from the water, may produce
the disease in those predisposed to it.The intemperate use of
ice-water and other cold drinks after a full meal or when the body is
exhausted by heat and fatigue, exposure to showers at the close of a
hot day, or passing from a heated room into damp cellars and
outbuildings, are frequent exciting causes.[Footnote 12: "Bias the pugilist, naturally a great eater, had a sudden
choleraic attack after having eaten of succulent food" (Hippocrates,
lib.At times there exists a certain condition of inactivity of the
digestive organs when the gastric juice is not secreted in sufficient
quantity, and perfectly sound food may undergo fermentation and set up
an attack.The offensive exhalation from a filthy alley which had been recently
cleaned was the exciting cause of a fatal epidemic in a London
school,[13] and Levier recounts an epidemic caused by the
drinking-water during the winter in Berne.[14]

[Footnote 13: _Lond.f. Heilk._, iii., 1864, p.Nervous disturbance from other diseases may act as a cause.Leube
reports a case of intermittent fever which was followed by an annual
attack of cholera morbus preceded by febrile symptoms.[15]

[Footnote 15: Leube, _Ziemssen_, 1876, vol.Malaria, sewer-gas, and sudden and powerful mental emotions are
credited with the causation of some attacks.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In a few cases an examination of the body has
revealed no phenomena sufficient to account for the symptoms, even when
they have been the most severe during life.In these cases either the
inflammation has not passed the first stage of development and the
resulting hyperaemia has disappeared after death, or the irritation of
the gastro-intestinal nerves has been sufficiently intense to cause
death before the alimentary tract has undergone any consequent
structural change.Usually, however, there are evidences of a general gastro-intestinal
catarrh: the mucous membrane is congested throughout and denuded of
epithelium.The solitary glands are enlarged and Peyer's patches
swollen and prominent.The blood is thickened and dark in color, and
the serous membranes dry, sticky, and covered with desquamated
epithelium.Indeed, the appearances may be identical with those
observed in true Asiatic {722} cholera.The kidneys are congested,
sometimes enlarged, and the tubules devoid of epithelium.In protracted
cases the general muscular system shows a beginning of granular
degeneration.In no case, however, can a positive diagnosis between Asiatic cholera
and cholera morbus be made from post-mortem appearances.SYMPTOMS.--The attack is usually sudden in its onset, but in some cases
is preceded by nausea, thirst, loss of appetite, and slight general
distress for some hours, or it may come on in the course of some
gastro-intestinal disturbance.Frequently it is developed during sleep,
particularly after midnight, the patient being aroused by a feeling of
pressure at the pit of the stomach, which is followed by nausea and
violent and incessant vomiting with intense pain, the contents of the
stomach being ejected with great force.The matters first vomited consist mainly of the food last eaten, little
altered or mixed with gastric mucus and tinged with bile.In a certain
proportion of cases the amount of bile is increased, although it is
difficult to judge of the relative proportion by the color and taste of
the vomited liquid.The general belief that the liver is implicated and
the bile secreted in morbid quantity rests upon conjecture alone, and
has no solid basis.After a time only yellow, brown, or greenish mucus,
with more or less bile, is ejected, and in protracted cases hiccough is
most distressing.Following the vomiting or at the same time with it purging comes on,
and it is usually preceded by borborygmi.In rare cases there is no
vomiting, but only intense pain in the bowels and copious alvine
discharges from the beginning to the end of the attack.The stools in
the beginning are normal in color, but soon become pulpy or semi-fluid.As they increase in quantity they become watery, consisting of
blood-serum with mucus, cast-off epithelium and pus-cells, and are
nearly odorless, and sometimes resemble very closely the discharges of
Asiatic cholera, but almost invariably retain the yellow or green color
of the bile.Colorless rice-water discharges are observed in undoubted
cases of cholera morbus outside of any epidemic influence.The
discharges are acrid and irritating, and the neighboring parts become
red and excoriated.At the same time there is intense burning or tearing pain in the
abdomen, generally centring at the umbilicus, great thirst and painful
contractions of the muscles of the abdomen and extremities,
particularly in the calves of the legs, and of the flexors of the
thighs, forearms, fingers, and toes.In the beginning there may be
tympanites, but this soon disappears, and the abdomen becomes retracted
and the muscles drawn up into knots.The cramps usually come on after
each act of vomiting and purging, but they may appear spontaneously.Abdominal tenderness is either wanting or slight.As the transudation
continues the thirst becomes intense, the tongue cold, dry, and coated,
and the tissues shrivelled from loss of water.The skin is cold,
clammy, or covered with a viscid sweat, and the surface of the body is
cyanosed, violet, or in the extremities it may have a marbled
appearance.The nose is pointed, the eyes dark and sunken, and there is
a general appearance of collapse.The mind may be clear throughout, but in protracted cases there is
great nervous prostration.The patient becomes dull and lethargic,
passing into stupor after great restlessness and jactitation.The voice
is faint {723} or whispering, the breath cold, and the respiration
sighing.The pulse in the beginning may be depressed, but soon becomes
rapid and often imperceptible, and there is great praecordial anxiety.As the blood becomes thickened the urine is highly, small in
quantity, and it may be suppressed.An examination shows traces of
albumen, casts and desquamated epithelium, and a decrease in the amount
of urea and salts.In the last stages there may be a slight rise in
temperature, but it has no definite course and it is usually absent.In
collapse the temperature of the surface of the body sinks below normal,
but the temperature of the interior may rise as high as 101 degrees or
102 degrees F., as shown by the thermometer in the rectum or
vagina.[16]

[Footnote 16: _London Hosp.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--But, fortunately, the course of the disease
tends toward recovery in the large majority of cases.The discharges
gradually decrease in quantity, the intervals are longer, the
appearance becomes more natural, and a profuse perspiration is followed
by a refreshing sleep.The surface becomes warmer, the pulse slower and
more full, and the skin regains its normal color.If the case has been a severe one or if it occurs in a person much
enfeebled by disease, it pursues a different course.The discharges
become almost uninterrupted, and at last are passed involuntarily.The
cramps are almost continuous or are convulsive, the pulse grows rapidly
weaker and is finally lost, coma succeeds stupor, and death follows in
collapse.The duration of the disease varies from a few hours to two or three
days; death has occurred within twelve hours.Recovery is generally complete after a few hours; and this rapid return
to the normal condition shows that there have been no textural change
of organs.Sometimes great emaciation, irritability of the stomach, and
slight diarrhoea persist for a few days, or symptoms of a general
gastro-enteritis may supervene.DIAGNOSIS.--In making the diagnosis of cholera morbus it is necessary
to carefully differentiate it from epidemic cholera and the effects
produced by irritant poisons, such as the metallic salts, poisonous
fungi, etc.Occurring during an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, it is not possible to
make a diagnosis, as the symptoms of cholera morbus and of mild cases
of the Asiatic disease are identical.From severe cases it is to be
distinguished by the absence of antecedent diarrhoea, by the presence
of bile in the vomited matters, and by the color and fecal odor of the
stools.The nausea and abdominal pain are more marked, while the
dyspnoea, cyanosis, and shrunken condition of the skin are less marked.The mortality of cholera morbus is slight, whilst about one-half of
those attacked with epidemic cholera die.In irritant poisoning the vomiting follows quickly after the ingestion
of a meal or poisonous matter; it continues for some time before
purging begins, and is out of all proportion to the diarrhoea.The
vomited matters contain blood and mucus and are never serous in
character.Corrosive poisons may cause redness, charring, or ulceration
of the mouth and throat and a burning sensation in the stomach.The
pain over the stomach is more constant and severe, particularly in the
intervals of {724} vomiting, and there may be abdominal tenderness and
bloody discharges.The expression is more anxious and the pulse rapid
and weak.Elaterium and tartar emetic will bring on vomiting and purging which
resemble the symptoms of cholera morbus.Choleriform attacks due to
uraemia simulate cholera morbus.The distinction is to be made by the
previous history--pain and purging being relatively less prominent in
uraemia--by the presence of albumen and casts in the urine, and by the
early tendency to coma.Acute peritonitis, attended by copious vomiting and purging, has been
mistaken for cholera morbus, and the true nature of the affection only
revealed by the autopsy.PROGNOSIS.--As a rule, cholera morbus occurring in persons otherwise
healthy ends favorably in a few hours.Cases of secondary fever, with
gastro-intestinal catarrh, may prolong the attack from a few days to
two weeks.Should treatment have no effect in lessening the vomiting
and purging, and should the evidences of heart-failure become apparent,
a fatal result may be feared.Death has occurred within twelve hours,
and the mortality is 3 per cent.[17]

[Footnote 17: Bartholow, _Pract.Med._, New York, 1880, p.Cases occurring in the course of other diseases possess a special
gravity.TREATMENT.--During the summer months, and particularly in August and
September, when the hot days are succeeded by cool nights, iced drinks
should be used in moderate quantities; the diet should be light,
nutritious, and easy of digestion.Unripe fruits and articles of food
liable to fermentative changes should not be indulged in.Exposure to the night air, particularly after a full meal, should be
especially avoided, and the clothing ought to be so arranged that
additions may be made as night approaches.Slight attacks of
indigestion should not be neglected, and any irregularity of the bowels
must receive immediate attention.The period when the physician is called upon to prescribe for an attack
of cholera morbus is usually when the stomach has been emptied of food
and the patient is vomiting incessantly, purging, and writhing in pain.If vomiting has not occurred and violent epigastric pain is the only
symptom, the stomach should be emptied by an emetic of hot water and
mustard repeated until the overcharged organ is completely emptied.Partially-digested food in a state of acid fermentation will thus be
got rid of, and the sufferings may be immediately but not wholly
relieved.If spontaneous vomiting has expelled the food, and the matters vomited
are green and watery, while pain and frequent stools with muscular
cramps, heart feebleness, and threatening collapse are the symptoms
presented, the remedy par excellence is a hypodermic injection of
sulphate of morphia (gr.1/8 to 1/3) with sulphate of atropia (gr.If one dose is not followed by decided mitigation of
suffering, the injection is to be repeated in a half hour or an hour,
not giving above one grain of morphia in divided doses.At the same
time, and while waiting for the full effect of the narcotic, efforts
can be directed to giving ease to the muscular spasms and pain by brisk
friction with stimulating lotions or by mustard poultices to the
abdomen and extremities.The morphia will be the best and quickest
stimulant which can be used; it will therefore be useless in most cases
to administer brandy, camphor, chloroform, {725} or other remedies of
that sort.Waiting and giving nothing by the mouth is the wiser course.In twenty minutes to half an hour the most perfect bien etre succeeds
to the previous agony and exhaustion.In some cases the vomiting,
purging, and cramps cease more gradually, and six hours will pass
before the patient is at ease.The intense thirst is best treated by
the giving of cracked ice sparingly at first, more freely later.Nothing substitutes morphia hypodermically with success, but in some
instances or when the stomach is not very irritable it may be necessary
to give medicine by the mouth.In this case chloroform (xv to xxx
drops), chlorodyne (x to xx drops), or spirits of camphor (v to x
drops) every quarter or half hour in ice-water may be directed.Chloroform and camphor can be combined with the deodorized tincture of
opium in ten- to twenty-drop doses.Time is wasted in expecting relief
from remedies which are inevitably rejected as soon as taken; it is
only when the stomach is very tolerant that it is judicious to begin
with them.The weakness of the heart's action must be combated by brandy or
whiskey, given by the mouth with pounded ice or administered
hypodermically.A considerable quantity of brandy or diluted alcohol
may be introduced by repeated injections beneath the skin.Iced
champagne may be tried with good effect.H. C. Wood quotes Hall[18] as
recommending hypodermic injections of chloral in the cold stage of
cholera.Five to eight grains in twenty minims of distilled water can
be thus given, and repeated at intervals of fifteen to twenty minutes
until some effect is perceived.[Footnote 18: _Lancet_, May 2, 1874.]If vomiting persists after the other symptoms--pain and muscular
spasms--are relieved, it is due to the intense gastric hyperaemia;
giving nothing which is not necessary is the wiser plan.Carbolic acid,
hydrocyanic acid, bismuth, bromide of sodium, or small doses of calomel
are remedies which meet the indication.Food should be withheld as long
as possible; then iced barley-water, followed by milk and lime-water in
very small quantities at short intervals, will test the power of the
stomach to retain and digest food.{726}

INTESTINAL AFFECTIONS OF CHILDREN IN HOT WEATHER.BY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.The summer affections of the intestines in children are chiefly of a
diarrhoeal character.Diarrhoeal attacks, as is well known, are much
more frequent and severe in the summer months than in other portions of
the year.Moreover, the diarrhoea of the summer season occurs chiefly
among children under the age of two and a half years, and is much more
common and fatal in the cities than in the country.In the large cities
this malady has heretofore been the annually-recurring scourge of
infancy, but of late years its prevalence has been in some degree
diminished and its severity controlled by the establishment of health
boards and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.Still, it remains
an important disease in all our cities, and one that largely increases
the aggregate mortality.The truth of this statement is shown by the
statistics of deaths taken at random from the mortuary records of any
large city.Thus, in New York City during 1882 the deaths from
diarrhoea reported to the Health Board, tabulated in months, were as
follows:

        Jan.Under
  five   34   32   50   50   72   231  1533  817   362  195   68   35
  years.Over
  five   14   15   14   20   15    19   131  149    84   55   31   24
  years.Therefore, in 1882--and the statistics of other years correspond in
this particular--it is seen that nine times as many deaths of children
under the age of five years occurred from diarrhoea during the five
months from June 1st to October 31st as in the remaining seven months
of the year.It is also seen, in corroboration of the statement that
diarrhoea due to hot weather is chiefly a disease of infancy and early
childhood, that during these same five months, which embrace the summer
season, the number of deaths from diarrhoea under the age of five years
was seven and a half times greater than the number over that age.These
statistics agree with the general experience of physicians in city
practice.The summer diarrhoea would indeed be comparatively
unimportant were its death-rate as low in the first five years of life
as subsequently.The following statistics show how great a destruction of life this
malady causes even under the surveillance of an energetic health board;
and before this board was established it was much greater, as I had
abundant opportunities to observe.The last annual report of the New
York Board of Health was made in 1875, since which time weekly
bulletins have been {727} issued.The deaths from diarrhoea at all ages
in the three last years in which annual reports were issued were as
follows:

              1873.January       94     43     46
  February      84     34     52
  March         97     40     58
  April        114     47     45
  May           95     61     89
  June         220    144    157
  July        1514   1205   1387
  August       967   1007   1012
  September    424    587    608
  October      213    255    185
  November      87    105     57
  December      53     56     50

Thus, in these three years the aggregate deaths from diarrhoea during
the months from June to October inclusive, in which months the summer
diarrhoea prevails, were 9885, while in the remaining seven months the
number was only 1407.How large a proportion of these deaths in the
warm season occurred in children we may infer from remarks made by the
Health Board in regard to another year.In their annual report for 1870
the board state: "The mortality from the diarrhoeal affections amounted
to 2789, or 33 per cent.of the total deaths; and of these deaths 95
per cent.occurred in children less than five years old, 92 per cent.in children less than two years old, and 67 per cent.Every year the reports of the Health Board furnish
similar statistics, but enough have been given to show how great a
sacrifice of life the summer complaint produces annually in this city.What we observe in New York in reference to this disease is true also,
to a greater or less extent, in other cities of this country and
Europe, so far as we have reports.Not in every city is there the same
proportionate mortality from this cause as in New York, but the
frequency of the summer diarrhoea and the mortality which attends it
render it an important disease in, I believe, most cities of both
continents.In country towns, whether in villages or farm-houses, this
disease is comparatively unimportant, inasmuch as few cases occur in
them, and the few that do occur are of mild type, and consequently much
less fatal than in the cities.The comparative immunity of the rural districts has an important
relation, as we will see, to the hygienic management of these cases.ETIOLOGY.--In the causation of this disease two distinct factors are
recognized--the one atmospheric, the other dietetic.The prevalence and severity of the summer diarrhoea correspond closely
with the degree of atmospheric heat, as may be inferred from the
foregoing statistics.In New York this disease begins in the month of
May--earlier in some years than in others--in a few scattered cases,
commonly of a mild type.Cases become more and more numerous and severe
as the weather grows warmer until July and August, when the diarrhoea
attains its maximum prevalence and severity.In these two months it is
by far the most frequent and fatal of all the diseases in cities.In
the middle of September new patients begin to be less common, and in
the latter part of this month and subsequently new cases do not occur,
unless under unusual circumstances which favor the development of this
malady.In New York a considerable number of deaths {728} of infants
occur from the diarrhoea in October.October is not a hot month in our
latitude--its average temperature is lower than that of May--and yet
the mortality from this disease is considerably larger in the former
than in the latter month.This fact, which seems to show that the
prevalence of the summer diarrhoea does not correspond with the degree
of atmospheric heat, is readily explained.The mortality in October,
and indeed in the latter part of September, is not that of new cases,
but is mainly of infants, as I have observed every year, who contract
the disease in July or August or earlier, and linger in a state of
emaciation and increasing weakness till they finally succumb, some even
in cool weather.The fact is therefore undisputed, and is universally admitted, that the
summer season, stated in a general way, is the cause of this
annually-recurring diarrhoeal epidemic, but it is not so easy to
determine what are the exact causative conditions or agents which the
summer weather brings into activity.That atmospheric heat does not in
itself cause the diarrhoea is evident from the fact that in the rural
districts there is the same intensity of heat as in the cities, and yet
the summer complaint does not occur.The cause must be looked for in
that state of the atmosphere engendered by heat where unsanitary
conditions exist, as in large cities.Moreover, observations show that
the noxious effluvia with which the air becomes polluted under such
circumstances constitute or contain the morbific agent.Thus, in one of
the institutions of this city a few years since, on May 10, which
happened to be an unusually warm day for this month, an offensive odor
was noticed in the wards, which was traced to a large manure-heap that
was being upturned in an adjacent garden.On this day four young
children were severely attacked by diarrhoea, and one died.Many other
examples might be cited showing how the foul air of the city during the
hot months, when animal and vegetable decomposition is most active,
causes diarrhoea.Several years since, while serving as sanitary
inspector for the Citizens' Association in one of the city districts,
my attention was particularly called to one of the streets, in which a
house-to-house visitation disclosed the fact that nearly every infant
between two avenues had the diarrhoea, and usually in a severe form,
not a few dying.This street was compactly built with wooden
tenement-houses on each side, and contained a dense population, mainly
foreign, poor, ignorant, and filthy in their habits.It had no sewer,
and the refuse of the kitchens and bed-chambers was thrown into the
street, where it accumulated in heaps.Water trickled down over the
sidewalks from the houses into the gutters or was thrown out as slops,
so that it kept up a constant moisture of the refuse matter which
covered the street, and promoted the decay of the animal and vegetable
substances which it contained.The air in the domicils and street under
such conditions of impurity was necessarily foul in the extreme, and
stifling during the hot days and nights of July and August; and it was
evidently the important factor in producing the numerous and severe
diarrhoeal cases which were in these domicils.In another locality, occupied by tripe-dealers and a low class of
butchers who carried on fat- and bone-boiling at night, the air was so
foul after dark that the peculiar impurity which tainted it could be
distinctly noticed in the mouth for a considerable time after a night
visit.In the street where {729} these nuisances existed and in
adjacent streets the summer diarrhoea was very prevalent and
destructive to human life.Murchison states that twenty out of
twenty-five boys were affected with purging and vomiting from inhaling
the effluvia from the contents of an old drain near their school-room.Physicians are familiar with a similar fact showing this purgative
effect of impure air--that the atmosphere of a dissecting-room often
causes diarrhoea in those otherwise healthy.The exact nature of the deleterious agent or agents in foul air which
cause the diarrhoea, whether they be gases or organisms, has not been
fully determined; but at a recent meeting of the Berliner Med.Gesellschaft, A. Baginsky made a report on the bacilli of cholera
infantum, which he states he has found both in the dejections and in
the intestinal mucous membrane in the bodies of those who have perished
with this disease.In the stools, along with numerous other organisms,
Baginsky states that he found masses of zoogloea, and the same
organisms he detected on the surface of the small intestines, and could
trace their wanderings as far as the submucous tissue.[1] But it is
evidently very difficult to determine whether such organisms sustain a
causative relation to diarrhoea or spring into existence in consequence
of the foul secretions and decomposing fecal matters which are present.The impurities in the air of a large city are very numerous.Among
those of a gaseous nature are sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen; various gases of the carbon group, as carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide; gases of the nitrogen
group, as the acetate, sulphide, and carbonate of ammonium, nitrous and
nitric acids; and at times compounds of phosphorus and chlorine
(Parkes).A theory deserving consideration is that certain gaseous
impurities found in the air form purgative combinations.D. F. Lincoln,
in his interesting paper on the atmosphere in the _Cyclopaedia of
Medicine_, writes in regard to sulphuretted hydrogen: "When in the air,
freely exposed to the contact of oxygen, it becomes sulphuric acid.Sulphide of ammonium in the same circumstances becomes a sulphate,
which, encountering common salt (chloride of sodium), produces sulphate
of sodium and chloride of ammonium.The sulphates form a characteristic
ingredient of the air in manufacturing districts."The sulphates, we
know, are for the most part purgatives, but whether they or other
chemical agents exist in the respired air in sufficient quantity to
disturb the action of the intestines, even where atmospheric impurities
are most abundant, is problematical and uncertain.Again, the solid impurities in the air of a large city are very
numerous, as any one may observe by viewing a sunbeam in a darkened
room, which is made visible by the numerous particles floating in it.These particles consist largely of organic matter, which sometimes has
been carried a long distance by the wind.The remarkable statement has
been made that in the air of Berlin organic forms have been found of
African production.Ehrenberg discovered fragments of insects of
various kinds--rhizopods, tardigrades, polygastrica, etc.--which,
existing in considerable quantity and inhaled in hot weather, when
decomposition and fermentation are most active, may be deleterious to
the system.Monads, bacteria, vibriones, amorphous dust containing
spores which {730} retain their vitality for months, are among the
substances found in the air of cities.The well-known hazy appearance
of the atmosphere resting over a large city like New York when viewed
from a distance is due to the gaseous and solid impurities with which
the air is so abundantly supplied--impurities which assume importance
in pathological studies, since minute organisms are now believed to
cause so many diseases the etiology of which has heretofore been
obscure.With our present knowledge we must be content with the general
statement that impure air is one of the two important factors which
cause summer diarrhoea, without being able to state positively which of
the elements in the air are most instrumental in causing this result.But the theory is plausible that minute organisms rather than chemical
products are the chief cause.Henoch of Berlin, writing upon this
subject, calls attention to the disease known as intestinal mycosis,
its prominent symptom being a severe diarrhoea produced by eating
diseased meat containing a fungus.He believes that "a portion of the
fungus not destroyed by the gastric juice settles upon different parts
of the intestine, and there produces its effects;" and he adds, "At
present, however, we can regard the mykotic theory of cholera infantum
only as a very probable hypothesis.There is no doubt that high
atmospheric temperature increases the tendency to fermentation
dyspepsias which is present in imperfectly-nourished children at all
seasons, and causes them to appear not only epidemically, but also in
an extremely acute form which is not frequent under ordinary
circumstances.This would lead to the conclusion that, in addition to
the heat, infectious germs are present, which, being developed in great
masses by the former, enter the stomach with the food."The fungus
theory of the causative relation of atmospheric heat to the diarrhoea
of the summer season as thus explained by Henoch commands the readier
assent since it comports with the well-known facts relating to the
etiology of the summer complaint.This disease, as we have seen, is
most prevalent and fatal under precisely those conditions of dense
population, filthy domicils and streets, and atmospheric heat which are
favorable for the development of low organisms.In those portions of our cities which are occupied by the poor, more
than anywhere else, those conditions prevail which render the
atmosphere deleterious.One accustomed to the pure air of the country
would scarcely believe how stifling and poisonous the atmosphere
becomes during the hot summer days and close summer nights in and
around the domicils in the poor quarters of the city.Among the causes
of this foul air may be mentioned too dense a population, the occupancy
of small rooms by large families, rigid economy and ceaseless endeavor
to make ends meet, so that in the absorbing interest sanitary
requirements are sadly neglected.Adults of such families, and children
of both sexes as soon as they are old enough, engage in laborious and
often filthy occupations.Many of them seldom bathe, and they often
wear for days the same undergarments, foul with perspiration and dirt.The intemperate, vicious, and indolent, who always abound in the
quarters of the city poor, are notoriously filthy in their habits and
add to the insalubrity by their presence.Children old enough to be in
the streets and adults away at their occupations escape to a great
extent the evil effects of impure air, but the infantile population
always suffer severely.Every physician who has witnessed the summer diarrhoea of infants is
{731} aware of the fact that the mode of feeding has much to do with
its occurrence.A large proportion of those who each summer fall
victims to it would doubtless escape if the feeding were exactly
proper.In New York City facts like the following are of common
occurrence in the practice of all physicians: Infants under the age of
eight months, if bottle-fed, nearly always contract diarrhoea, and
usually of an obstinate character, during the summer months.The
younger the infant, the less able is it to digest any other food than
breast-milk, and the more liable is it therefore to suffer from
diarrhoea if bottle-fed.In the institutions nearly every bottle-fed
infant under the age of four or even six months dies in the hot months
with symptoms of indigestion and intestinal catarrh, while the
wet-nursed of the same ages remain well.Sudden weaning, the sudden
substitution of cow's milk or any artificially-prepared food in place
of breast-milk in hot weather, almost always produces diarrhoea, often
of a severe and fatal nature.Feeding an infant in the hot months with
indigestible and improper food, as fruits with seeds or the ordinary
table-food prepared in such a way that it overtaxes the digestive
function of the infant, causes diarrhoea, and not infrequently that
severe form of it which will be described under the term cholera
infantum.Many obstinate cases of the summer complaint begin to improve
under change of diet, as by the substitution of one kind of milk for
another or the return of the infant to the breast after it has been
temporarily withdrawn from it.It is a common remark in the families of
the city poor that the second summer is the period of greatest danger
to infants.This increased liability of infants to contract diarrhoea
in the second summer is due to the fact that most infants in their
second year are table-fed, while in the first year they are wet-nursed.Such facts, with which all physicians are familiar, show how important
the diet is as a factor in causing the summer complaint.Occasionally, from continued ill-health, the milk of the mother or
wet-nurse does not agree with the nursling.Examined with the
microscope, it is found to contain colostrum.Under such circumstances
if a healthy wet-nurse be employed the diarrhoea ceases.It is very
important that any woman furnishing breast-milk to an infant should
lead a quiet and regular life, with regular meals and sleep.19, 1882, R. B. Gilbert relates
striking cases in which venereal excesses on the part of wet-nurses
were immediately followed by fatal diarrhoea in the infants which they
suckled.One not a resident would scarcely be able to appreciate the difficulty
which is experienced in a large city in obtaining proper diet for young
children, especially those of such an age that they require milk as the
basis of their food.Milk from cows stabled in the city or having a
limited pasturage near the city, and fed upon a mixture of hay with
garden and distillery products, the latter often largely predominating,
is unsuitable.It is deficient in nutritive properties, prone to
fermentation, and from microscopical and chemical examinations which
have been made it appears that it often contains deleterious
ingredients.If milk be obtained from distant farms where pasturage is
fresh and abundant--and in New York City this is the usual source of
the supply--considerable time elapses before it is served to customers,
so that, particularly in the hot months of July and August, it
frequently has begun to undergo {732} lactic-acid fermentation when the
infants receive it.That dispensed to families in the morning is the
milking of the previous morning and evening.The common result of the
use of this milk in midsummer by infants under the age of ten months is
more or less diarrhoea.The ill-success of feeding with cow's milk has led to the preparation
of various kinds of food which the shops contain, but no dietetic
preparation has yet appeared which agrees so well with the digestive
function of the infant as breast-milk, and is at the same time
sufficiently nutritive.In New York City improper diet, unaided by the conditions which hot
weather produces, is a common cause of diarrhoea in young infants, for
we meet with this diarrhoea in infants who are bottle-fed at all
seasons; but when the atmospheric conditions of hot weather and the use
of food unsuitable for the age of the infant are both present and
operative, this diarrhoea so increases in frequency and severity that
it is proper to designate it the summer epidemic of the cities.Several
years since, before the New York Foundling Asylum was established, the
foundlings of New York, more than a thousand annually, were taken to
the almshouse on Blackwell's Island and consigned to the care of the
pauper-women, who were mostly old, infirm, and filthy in their habits
and apparel.Their beds, in which the foundlings were also placed
alongside of them, were seldom clean, not properly aired and washed,
and under the beds were various garments and utensils which these
pauper-women had brought with them as their sole property from their
miserable abodes in the city.With such surroundings, the air which
these infants breathed day and night manifestly contained poisonous
emanations; while their diet was equally improper, for it was prepared
by these women from such milk and farinaceous food as were furnished
the almshouse.When assigned to duty in the almshouse, this service
being at that time a branch of Charity Hospital, I was informed that
all the foundlings died before the age of two months; one only was
pointed out as a curiosity which had been an exception to the rule.The
disease of which they perished was diarrhoea, and this malady in the
summer months was especially severe and rapidly fatal.The unpleasant
experiences in this institution furnished additional evidence, were any
wanting, that foul air and improper diet are the two important factors
in causing the summer diarrhoea of infants.Since that beneficial
charity, the New York Foundling Asylum, in East Sixty-eighth street,
came into existence, providing pure air and, for a considerable
proportion of the foundlings, breast-milk, many of these waifs have
been rescued from death.I have already stated that this disease occurs, with an occasional
exception, under the age of two and a half years.The following table
embraces all the cases that came to one of the city dispensaries during
my service between the months of May and October, inclusive:

       Age.5 months or under         58
   5 months to 12 months    212
  12 months to 18 months    174
  18 months to 24 months     93
  24 months to 36 months     36
                            ---
        Total               573

After the third year the liability to the summer complaint so rapidly
{733} diminishes that comparatively few are affected by it.It is seen
from the above statistics that by far the largest number of cases occur
during the period of first dentition; hence the prevalent opinion among
families that dentition causes the diarrhoea.It is the common belief
among the poor of New York that diarrhoea occurring during dentition is
conservative, and should not be checked.They believe that an infant
cutting its teeth suffers less, and may be saved from serious illness,
if it have frequent stools.Every summer I see infants reduced to a
state of imminent danger through the continuance of diarrhoea during
several weeks, nothing having been done to check it in consequence of
this absurd belief.The progressive loss of flesh and strength and
wasting of the features do not excite alarm, under the blinding
influence of this theory, till the diarrhoea has continued so long and
become so severe that it is with difficulty controlled, and the patient
is in a state of real danger when the physician is first summoned.The
following statistics, which comprise cases occurring during my service
in one of the city dispensaries, show the preponderance of cases during
the age when dental evolution is occurring:

                                              Cases.No teeth and no marked turgescence of gums    47
  Cutting incisors                             106
     "    anterior molars                       41
     "    canines                               40
     "    last molars                           20
  All the teeth cut                             28
                                               ---
        Total                                  282

It so happens that the period of dental evolution corresponds with that
of the most rapid development and the greatest functional activity of
the gastric and intestinal follicles, and the predisposition which
exists to diarrhoeal maladies at this age must be attributed to this
cause rather than to dentition.SYMPTOMS.--The summer diarrhoea of infants commonly begins gradually
with languor, fretfulness, and slight febrile movement.The diarrhoea
at first usually attracts little attention from its mildness.The
stools, while they are thinner than natural, vary in appearance, being
yellow, brown, or green.Infants with milk diet are apt to pass green
and acid stools containing particles of undigested casein.The tongue
in the commencement of the attack is moist and covered with a slight
fur.At a more advanced stage it may be moist, but is often dry, and in
dangerous forms of the malady, accompanied by prostration, the buccal
surface is red and the gums more or less swollen and sometimes
ulcerated.It may commence simultaneously with the
diarrhoea, especially when food that is unusually indigestible and
irritating to the stomach has been given, but more frequently this
symptom does not appear until the diarrhoea has continued a few days.I
preserved memoranda of the date when vomiting began in the cases
treated in two consecutive summers, and found that ordinarily it was
toward the close of the first week.When it is an early and prominent
symptom it appears to be due to the presence in the stomach of
imperfectly digested or fermented and acid food, which, when ejected,
gives a decidedly acid reaction with appropriate tests.It contains
coagulated casein and undigested particles of whatever food has been
given.In many patients the progressive loss of flesh and {734}
strength is largely due to the indigestion and vomiting by which the
food, which is so much required for proper nourishment, is lost.Emesis occurring at a late stage of the summer complaint is often due
to commencing spurious hydrocephalus, which is not an infrequent
complication, as we will see, of protracted cases.Perhaps when a late
symptom it may sometimes have an uraemic origin, for the urine is
usually quite scanty in advanced cases.It seems probable, however,
that deleterious effects from non-elimination of urea are to a
considerable extent prevented by the diarrhoea.The fecal evacuations may remain nearly uniform in appearance during
the disease, but in many patients they vary in color and consistence at
different periods.In the same case they may be brown and offensive at
one time, green at another, and again they may contain masses of a
putty-like appearance, the partly-digested casein or altered epithelial
cells.The stools sometimes consist largely of mucus, with or without
occasional streaks of blood, indicating the predominance of
inflammation in the colon.This is the mucous diarrhoea of Barrier.The
stools are sometimes yellow when passed, but become green on exposure
to the air from chemical reaction due to admixture with the urine.The character of the alvine discharges is interesting.In addition to
undigested casein I have found epithelial cells, single or in clusters
(sometimes regularly arranged as if detached in mass from the villi),
fibres of meat, crystalline formations, mucus, and occasionally blood,
as stated above.In one instance I observed an appearance resembling
three or four crypts of Lieberkuhn united, probably thrown off by
ulceration.If the stools are green, <DW52> masses of various sizes,
but mostly small, are also seen under the microscope.The pulse is accelerated according to the severity of the attack.The
heat of the surface is at first apt to be increased, though but
slightly in ordinary cases; but when the vital powers begin to fail
from the continuance of the diarrhoea the warmth of the surface
diminishes.In advanced cases approaching a fatal termination the face
and extremities are pallid and cool, and the pulse gradually becomes
more frequent and feeble.The skin is usually dry, and, as already
stated, the urinary secretion diminished.In severe cases attended by
frequent alvine discharges the infant does not pass urine oftener than
once or twice daily.The imperfect action of the skin and kidneys is
noteworthy.Protracted cases of the summer complaint are apt to be complicated by
two cutaneous eruptions--erythema extending over the perineum and
frequently as far as the thighs and lower part of the abdomen, due to
the acid and irritating character of the stools; and boils upon the
forehead and scalp.The latter sometimes extend to the pericranium, and
in case of recovery leave permanent cicatrices.This furuncular
affection of the scalp has seemed to me useful in consequence of the
external irritation which it causes, since it occurs at a time when, on
account of the feeble heart's action and languid circulation, passive
congestion of the vessels of the brain and meninges is liable to be
present.Patients who are weak and wasted in consequence of protracted
diarrhoea, remaining almost constantly in the recumbent position, often
have an occasional dry cough which continues till the close of life.It
is due to hypostatic congestion in the lungs, usually limited to the
posterior and {735} inferior portions of the lobes, extending but a
little way into the lungs.It is the result of prolonged recumbency
with feeble heart's action and feeble pulmonary circulation.Infants
reduced by chronic diseases, lying day after day in their cribs with
little movement of their bodies, are very liable to this passive
congestion of depending portions of their lungs, toward which the blood
gravitates, and into which but little air enters in consequence of
their distance and position and the feeble respirations.The hyperaemia
which results is of a passive character, a venous congestion, and the
affected lobules have a dusky-red color.This congestion, continuing,
soon results in pneumonitis of the catarrhal form, subacute and of a
low grade, for pulmonary lobules in which the blood remains stagnant
soon exhibit augmented cell-proliferation, perhaps from the irritating
effects of the elements of the blood now withdrawn from the
circulation.I have made or procured a considerable number of microscopic
examinations in these cases of hypostatic pneumonia, and the
solidification of the pulmonary lobules has been found to be due to the
exaggerated development of the epithelial cells in the alveoli,
together with venous congestion.The affected lobules, whether in the
stage of hypostatic congestion or the more advanced stage of hypostatic
pneumonitis, when examined at the autopsy, were somewhat softer than in
health, of dark color, and many of the lobules could be inflated by
strong force of the breath; but in protracted cases the alveoli in
central parts of the inflamed area resisted insufflation.The lung in
hypostatic pneumonia, even when it is inflated, still feels firmer
between the fingers than normal lung.Hypostatic pneumonia is so common in hospitals for infants that some
physicians whose observations have been chiefly in such institutions
have almost ignored other forms of pulmonary inflammation.Billard,
many years ago, wrote: "... The pneumonia of young children is
evidently the result of stagnation of blood in their lungs.Under these
circumstances the blood may be regarded as a kind of foreign body."Of
all the chronic and exhausting diseases of infancy, no one has,
according to my observations, been so frequently complicated by
hypostatic pneumonia as the disease which we are considering, although
it does not usually give rise to any more prominent symptom than an
occasional cough.Limited to a small and almost immovable part of the
lung, it does not ordinarily accelerate respiration or render it
painful, and the cough is also apparently painless.When progressive loss of flesh and strength has continued several
weeks, and the patient is much exhausted, another complication is apt
to occur, known as spurious hydrocephalus or the hydrocephaloid
disease, the anatomical characters of which will be described in the
proper place.The commencement of spurious hydrocephalus is announced
by gradually increasing drowsiness, perhaps preceded by a period of
unusual fretfulness.Vomiting and rolling the head are occasional early
symptoms of this complication.As the drowsiness increases the pupils
become less sensitive to light than in their normal state, and are
usually contracted.When the drowsiness becomes profound and constant,
the pupils remain contracted as in sound sleep or in opium narcotism.The functional activity of the organs is now also diminished, the
vomiting ceases, the stools become less frequent, the buccal surface
dry, and the urine more {736} scanty, while the pulse is more frequent
and feeble.Spurious hydrocephalus either continues till death, or by
stimulation the patient may emerge from it.Although the summer complaint in its commencement may be promptly
arrested by proper hygienic and medicinal treatment, if it continue a
few weeks the anatomical changes which occur are such that recovery, if
it take place, is necessarily slow and gradual.Improvement is shown by
better digestion, fewer stools and of better appearance, less frequent
vomiting, a more cheerful countenance, and the absence of symptoms
which indicate a complication.Many recover after days of anxious
watching and perhaps after many fluctuations.Death may occur early from a sudden aggravation of symptoms and rapid
sinking, or the attack may be so violent from the first that the infant
quickly succumbs; but more frequently death takes place after a
prolonged sickness.Little by little the patient loses flesh and
strength, till a state of marked emaciation is reached.The eyes and
cheeks are sunken, the bony projections of the face, trunk, and limbs
become prominent, and the skin lies in wrinkles from the wasting.The
altered expression of the face makes the patient look older than the
actual age.The joints in contrast with the wasted extremities seem
enlarged and the fingers and toes elongated.The stools diminish in
frequency from diminished peristaltic and vermicular action, and
vomiting, if previously present, now ceases.A feeble, quick, and
scarcely appreciable pulse, slow respiration, and diminished inflation
of the lungs, sightless and contracted pupils, over which the eyelids
no longer close, announce the near approach of death.The drowsiness
increases and the limbs become cool, while perhaps the head is hot.The
infant no longer has the ability to nurse, or if bottle-fed the food
placed in the mouth flows back or is swallowed with apparent
indifference.So low is its vitality that it lies pallid and almost
motionless for hours or even days before death, and death occurs so
quietly that the moment of its occurrence is scarcely appreciable.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Since the prominent and essential symptoms of
the disease which we are considering pertain to the digestive
apparatus, it is evident that the lesions which attend and characterize
it are to be found in this part of the system.Lesions elsewhere, so
far as they are appreciable to us, are secondary and not essential.I
have witnessed a large number of autopsies of infants who have perished
from the summer complaint, chiefly in institutions, and they have been
sufficiently marked and uniform to enable us to designate it an
entero-colitis.Several years since I preserved records of the
autopsical appearances in the intestinal catarrh of infants, most of
the cases being of summer diarrhoea.Since then I have each summer witnessed autopsies in the institutions
in cases of this disease, and the lesions observed were the same as in
the eighty-two cases.The question may properly be asked: Can inflammatory hyperaemia of the
intestinal mucous membrane be distinguished from simple congestion if
there be no ulceration and no appreciable thickening of the intestine?It is possible that occasionally I have recorded as inflammatory what
was simply a congestive lesion, but I do not think I have incorporated
a {737} sufficient number of such cases to vitiate the statistics.In a
large proportion of the cases there was evident thickening of the
intestinal mucous membrane or other unequivocal evidence of
inflammation.The following is an analysis of the eighty-two cases:

The duodenum and jejunum presented the appearance of inflammatory
hyperaemia in 12 cases.The hyperaemia was usually in patches of
variable extent or of that form described by the term arborescent.In
51 cases the duodenal and jejunal mucous membrane was pale and without
any other appearance characteristic of catarrh or inflammation.In the
remaining 19 cases the appearance of the duodenum and jejunum was not
recorded, so that it was probably normal.On the other hand, in the
ileum inflammatory lesions were present as a rule.In 49 cases I found
the surface of the ileum distinctly hyperaemic, and in that portion of
it nearest the ileo-caecal valve, including the valve itself, the
inflammation had evidently been the most intense, since in this portion
the hyperaemia and thickening of the mucous membrane were most marked.In 16 cases the surface of the ileum appeared nearly or quite normal;
in 14 hyperaemia in the small intestines in patches, streaks, or
arborescence was recorded, but the records do not state in which
division of the intestines they were observed.Billard, with other observers, has noticed the frequency and intensity
of the inflammatory lesions in entero-colitis in the terminal portion
of the small intestines, and the thickening in many cases of the
ileo-caecal valve, and he asks whether the vomiting which is so common
and often obstinate in this disease may not be sometimes due to
obstruction to the passage of fecal matter at the valve in consequence
of the hyperaemia and swelling, but has not observed any retained fecal
matter above it, such as we find in any part of the colon, or any other
appearance which indicated sufficient obstruction to cause symptoms.Still, it seems not improbable that the reason why the inflammatory
lesions are more pronounced at and immediately above the valve than in
other parts of the small intestine is that the fecal matter, so
commonly acid and irritating in this disease, is somewhat delayed in
its passage downward at this point.Small superficial circular or oval ulcers were observed in the ileum in
4 cases, in 2 of which they were found also in the lower part of the
jejunum.In 1 case the records state that ulcers were in the jejunum,
but do not mention whether they were also in the ileum.In 1 case, in
which there was much thickening of the ileum next to the ileo-caecal
valve, many small granulations had sprouted up from the submucous
connective tissue, so that the mucous surface appeared as if studded
with small warts.Softening of the mucous membrane was also apparent in certain cases.The firmness of its attachment to the parts underneath varied
considerably in different specimens.I was able in cases in which there
was considerable softening to detach readily the mucous membrane with
the nail or handle of the scalpel within so short a period after death
that it was probable that the change of consistence was not cadaveric.In some cases the vessels of the submucous tissue were injected and
this tissue infiltrated.In all the cases except one lesions were present indicating
inflammation {738} of the mucous membrane of the colon.In 39
hyperaemia, thickening, and other signs of inflammation extended over
nearly or quite the entire colon; in 14 the colitis was confined to the
descending portion entirely or almost entirely; in 28 cases the records
state that inflammatory lesions were found in the colon, but their
exact location is not mentioned.In 18 of the autopsies the mucous
membrane of the colon was found ulcerated.Therefore, according to these statistics--and autopsies which I have
witnessed that are not embraced in them disclosed similar
lesions--colitis is present, almost without exception, in cases of
summer diarrhoea, associated with more or less ileitis.The portion of
the colon which presents the most marked inflammatory lesions is that
in and immediately above the sigmoid flexure--that portion, therefore,
in which any fermenting fecal matter has reached its greatest degree of
fermentation, and consequently contains the most irritating elements,
and where, next to the caput coli, it is longest delayed in its passage
downward.The solitary glands of both the large and small intestines and Peyer's
patches undergo hyperplasia.In cases of short duration, and in parts
of the intestine where the inflammatory action has been mild, the
solitary glands present a vascular appearance, like the surrounding
membrane, and are slightly enlarged.The enlargement is most apparent
if the intestine be viewed by transmitted light, when not only are the
glands seen to be swollen, but their central dark points are distinct.If a higher grade of intestinal catarrh or a catarrh more protracted
have occurred, the volume of these follicles is so increased that they
rise above the common level and present a papillary appearance.Peyer's
patches are also distinct and punctate.The enlargement of Peyer's
patches, like that of the solitary glands, is due to hyperplasia, the
elementary cells being largely increased in number.The small ulcers which, as we have seen from the above statistics, are
present in a certain proportion of cases in the mucous membrane of the
colon, and more rarely in that of the small intestine when the
inflammation has been protracted and of a severe type, appear to occur
in the solitary glands and in the mucous membrane surrounding them.While some of these glands in a specimen are simply tumefied, others
are slightly ulcerated, and others still nearly or quite destroyed.The
ulcers are usually from one to three lines in diameter, circular or
oval, with edges slightly raised from infiltration.Rarely, I have seen
minute coagula of blood in one or more ulcers, and I have also observed
ulcers which have evidently been larger and have partially healed.The
ulcers are more frequently found in the descending colon than in other
portions of the intestines.When ulcers are present they commonly occur
in the descending colon, or if occurring elsewhere they are most
abundant in this situation.According to my observations, these ulcers are found chiefly in infants
over the age of six months--during the time, therefore, when there is
greatest functional activity and most rapid development of the solitary
glands.Peyer's patches, though frequently prominent and distinct, have
not been ulcerated in any of the cases observed by me.The appendix vermiformis participates in the catarrh when it occurs in
the caput coli, its mucous membrane being hyperaemic and thickened.In
{739} certain rare cases the inflammation is so intense that a thin
film of fibrin is exuded in places upon the surface of the colon.It is
apt to be overlooked or to be washed away in the examination.The
rectum usually presents no inflammatory lesions, or but slight lesions
in comparison with those in the colon.It usually remains of the normal
pale color, or but slightly vascular even when there is almost general
colitis.Hence the infrequency of tenesmus.As might be expected from the nature of the disease, the secretion of
mucus from the intestinal surface is augmented.It is often seen
forming a layer upon the intestinal surface, and it appears in the
stools mixed with epithelial cells and sometimes with blood and pus.The mesenteric glands in cases which have run the most protracted
course and end fatally are found more or less enlarged from
hyperplasia.They are frequently as large as a pea or larger, and of a
light color, the color being due not only to the hyperplasia, but in
part to the anaemia.Occasionally, when patients have been much reduced
from the long continuance of the diarrhoea, and are in a state of
marked cachexia at death, we find certain of these glands caseous.The condition of the stomach is interesting, since indigestion and
vomiting are so commonly present.I have records of its appearance in
59 cases, in 42 of which it seemed normal, having the usual pale color
and exhibiting only such changes as occur in the cadaver.In the
remaining 17 cases the stomach was more or less hyperaemic, and in 3 of
them points of ulceration were observed in the mucous membrane.All physicians familiar with this disease have remarked the frequency
of stomatitis.In protracted and grave cases it is a common
complication.The buccal surface in these cases is more vascular than
natural, and if the vital powers are much reduced superficial
ulcerations are not infrequent, oftener upon the gums than elsewhere.The gums are apt to be spongy, more or less swollen, bleeding readily
when rubbed or pressed upon.Thrush is a common complication of the
summer complaint in infants under the age of three or four months, but
is infrequent in older infants.Occurring in those over the age of six
or eight months, it has an unfavorable prognostic significance,
indicating a form of summer diarrhoea which commonly eventuates in
death.The belief has long been prevalent in the past that the liver is also
in fault.The green color of the stools was supposed to be due to
vitiated bile.But usually in the post-mortem examinations which I have
made I have found that the green coloration of the fecal matter did not
appear at the point where the bile enters the intestines, but at some
point below the ductus communis choledochus in the jejunum or ileum.The green tinge, at first slight, becomes more and more distinct on
tracing it downward in the intestine.It appears to be due to admixture
of the intestinal secretions with the fecal matter.I have notes of the appearance and state of the liver in 32 fatal
cases.Nothing could be seen in these examinations which indicated any
anatomical change in this organ that could be attributed to the
diarrhoeal malady.The size and weight of the liver varied considerably
in infants of the same age, but probably there was no greater
difference than usually obtains among glandular organs in a state of
health.The following was the weight of this organ in 20 cases: {740}

    Age.4 weeks   5     ounces.| 10 months   6-3/4 ounces.2 months  3-1/2   "      | 13   "      6       "
  2   "     3-1/2   "      | 14   "      9       "
  4   "     5       "      | 15   "      6       "
  5   "     6-1/2   "      | 15   "      7-1/2   "
  5   "     9       "      | 15   "      9-1/2   "
  7   "     4-1/2   "      | 16   "      6       "
  7   "     6       "      | 19   "      4-1/2   "
  7   "     6-1/4   "      | 20   "      9-1/4   "
  9   "     8       "      | 23   "     15       "

In none of these cases did the size, weight, or appearance of this
organ seem to be different from that in health or in other diseases,
except in one in which fatty degeneration had occurred, but this was
probably due to tuberculosis, which was also present.In most of these
cases the liver was examined microscopically, and the only noteworthy
appearance observed was the variable amount of oil-globules in the
hepatic cells.In some specimens the oil-globules were in excess, in
others deficient, and in others still they were more abundant in one
part of the organ than in another.Little importance was attached to
these differences in the quantity of oily matter.Hypostatic congestion of the posterior portions of the lungs, ending if
it continue in a form of subacute catarrhal pneumonia and giving rise
to an occasional painless cough, has been described in the preceding
pages.The character of the cough in connection with the wasting might
excite suspicions of the presence of tubercles in the lungs; but
tubercles are rare in this disease, and when present I should suspect a
strong hereditary predisposition.They occurred in only 1 of the 82
cases.The state of the encephalon in those patients in whom spurious
hydrocephalus occurs is interesting.In protracted cases of the
diarrhoea the brain wastes like the body and limbs.In the young
infant, in whom the cranial bones are still ununited, the occipital and
sometimes the frontal bones become depressed and overlapped by the
parietal, the depression being of course proportionate to the
diminution in size of the encephalon.In older children, with the cranial bones consolidated, serous effusion
occurs according to the degree of waste, thus preserving the size of
the encephalon.The effusion is chiefly external to the brain, lying
over the convolutions from the base to the vertex.Its quantity varies
from one or two drachms to an ounce or more.Along with this serous
effusion, and antedating it, passive congestion of the cerebral veins
and sinuses is also present.This congestion is the obvious and
necessary result of the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss
of brain substance.DIAGNOSIS.--The occurrence and continuance of diarrhoea in the warm
months, without any apparent cause except the agencies which hot
weather produces, indicate this disease.The exciting cause of the
attack may be the use of some indigestible and irritating substance,
dietetic or medicinal, as fruits with their seeds or a purgative
medicine; but if it continue after the immediate effects of the agent
have passed off, it is proper to attribute the diarrhoea to the summer
season.In the adult abdominal tenderness is an important diagnostic symptom of
intestinal catarrh, but in the infant this symptom is lacking or is not
in general appreciable, so that it does not aid in diagnosis.When the
{741} diagnosis of the disease is established, the symptoms do not
usually indicate what part of the intestinal surface is chiefly
involved, but it may be assumed that it is the lower part of the ileum
and the colon.The presence of mucus or of mucus tinged with blood in
the stools shows the predominance of colitis.PROGNOSIS.--Although this disease every summer largely increases the
death-rate of young children, most cases can be cured if the proper
hygienic and medicinal measures be early applied.It is obvious, from
what has been stated in the foregoing pages, that cholera infantum is
the form of this malady which involves greatest danger.Except in such
cases there is sufficient forewarning of a fatal result, for if death
occur it is after a lingering sickness, with fluctuations and gradual
loss of flesh and strength.Patients often recover from a state of
great prostration and emaciation, provided that no fatal complications
arise.The eyes may be sunken, the skin lie in folds from the wasting,
the strength may be so exhausted that any other than the recumbent
position is impossible, and yet the patient may recover by removal to
the country, by change of weather, or by the use of better diet and
remedies.Therefore an absolutely unfavorable prognosis should not be
made except in cases that are complicated or that border on collapse.The most dangerous symptoms, except those which indicate commencing or
actual collapse, arise from the state of the brain.Rolling the head,
squinting, feeble action or permanent contraction of the pupils,
spasmodic or irregular movements of the limbs, indicate the near
approach of death, as do also coldness of face and extremities and
inability to swallow.It is obvious also that in making the prognosis
in ordinary cases we should consider the age of the patient, the state
of the weather, the time in the summer, whether in the beginning or
near its close, and the surroundings, especially in reference to the
impurity of the air, as well as the patient's condition.Cholera Infantum, or Choleriform Diarrhoea.This is the most severe form of the summer complaint.It receives the
name which designates it from the violence of its symptoms, which
closely resemble those of Asiatic cholera.It is, however, quite
distinct from that disease.It is characterized by frequent stools,
vomiting, great elevation of temperature, and rapid and great
emaciation and loss of strength.It commonly occurs under the age of
two years.It sometimes begins abruptly, the previous health having
been good; in other cases it is preceded by the ordinary form of summer
diarrhoea.The stools have been thinner than natural and somewhat more
frequent, but not such as to excite alarm, when suddenly they become
more frequent and watery, and the parents are surprised and frightened
by the rapid sinking and real danger of the infant.The first evacuations, unless there have been previous diarrhoea, may
contain fecal matter, but subsequently they are so thin that they soak
into the diaper like urine, and in some cases they scarcely produce
more of a stain than does this secretion.Their odor is peculiar--not
fecal, but musty and offensive, and occasionally almost odorless.Commencing simultaneously with the watery evacuations or soon after is
another {742} symptom, irritability of the stomach, which increases
greatly the prostration and danger.Whatever drinks are swallowed by
the infant are rejected immediately or after a few moments, or retching
may occur without vomiting.The appetite is lost and the thirst is
intense.Cold water is taken with avidity, and if the infant nurse it
eagerly seizes the breast in order to relieve the thirst.The tongue is
moist at first, and clean or covered with a light fur, pulse
accelerated, respiration either natural or somewhat increased in
frequency, and the surface warm, but the temperature is speedily
reduced in severe cases.The internal temperature or that of the blood
is always very high.In ordinary cases of cholera infantum the
thermometer introduced into the rectum rises to or above 105 degrees,
and I have seen it indicate 107 degrees.Although the infant may be
restless at first, it does not appear to have any abdominal pain or
tenderness.The restlessness is apparently due to thirst or to that
unpleasant sensation which the sick feel when the vital powers are
rapidly reduced.The urine is scanty in proportion to the gravity of
the attack, as it ordinarily is when the stools are frequent and
watery.The emaciation and loss of strength are more rapid than in any other
disease which I can recall to mind, unless in Asiatic cholera.In a few
hours the parents scarcely recognize in the changed and melancholy
aspect of the infant any resemblance to the features which it exhibited
a day or two before.The eyes are sunken, the eyelids and lips are
permanently open from the feeble contractile power of the muscles which
close them, while the loss of the fluids from the tissues and the
emaciation are such that the bony angles become more prominent and the
skin in places lies in folds.As the disease approaches a fatal termination, which often occurs in
two or three days, the infant remains quiet, not disturbed even by the
flies which alight upon its face.The limbs and face become cool, the
eyes bleared, pupils contracted, and the urine scanty or suppressed.In
some instances, when the patient is near death, the respiration becomes
accelerated, either from the effect of the disease upon the respiratory
centres or from pulmonary congestion resulting from the feeble
circulation.As the vital powers fail the pulse becomes progressively
more feeble, the surface has a clammy coldness, the contracted pupils
no longer respond to light, and the stupor deepens, from which it is
impossible to arouse the infant.In the most favorable cases cholera infantum is checked before the
occurrence of these grave symptoms, and often in cases which are
ultimately fatal there is not such a speedy termination of the malady
as is indicated in the above description.The choleriform diarrhoea
abates and the case becomes one of ordinary summer complaint.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Rilliet and Barthez, who of foreign writers
treat of cholera infantum at greatest length, describe it under the
name of gastro-intestinal choleriform catarrh."The perusal," they
remark, "of anatomico-pathological descriptions, and especially the
study of the facts, show that the gastro-intestinal tube in subjects
who succumb to this disease may be in four different states: (_a_)
either the stomach is softened without any lesion of the digestive
tube; (_b_) or the stomach is softened at the same time that the mucous
membrane of the intestine, and especially its follicular apparatus, is
diseased; (_c_) or the stomach is healthy, {743} while the follicular
apparatus or the mucous membrane is diseased; (_d_) or, finally, the
gastro-intestinal tube is not the seat of any lesion appreciable to our
senses in the present state of our knowledge, or it presents lesions so
insignificant that they are not sufficient to explain the gravity of
the symptoms."So far, the disease resembles all the catarrhs, but what is special is
the abundance of serous secretion and the disturbance of the great
sympathetic nerve."The serous secretion, which appears to be produced by a perspiration
(analogous to that of the respiratory passages and of the skin) rather
than by a follicular secretion, shows, perhaps, that the elimination of
substances is effected by other organs than the follicles; perhaps,
also, we ought to see a proof that the materials to eliminate are not
the same as in simple catarrh.Upon all these points we are constrained
to remain in doubt.We content ourselves with pointing out the
fact."[2]

[Footnote 2: _Maladies des Enfants_.]On the 1st of August, 1861, I made the autopsy of an infant sixteen
months old who died of cholera infantum with a sickness of less than
one day.Nothing
unusual was observed in the brain, unless perhaps a little more than
the ordinary injection of vessels at the vertex.No marked anatomical
change was observed in the stomach and intestines, except enlargement
of the patches of Peyer as well as of the solitary and mesenteric
glands.In this and the following cases there was
apparently slight softening of the intestinal mucous membrane, but
whether it was pathological or cadaveric was uncertain, as the weather
was very warm.Examined by the microscope, it
was found to contain about the normal number of oil-globules.The second case was that of an infant seven months old, wet-nursed, who
died July 26, 1862, after a sickness also of about one day.He was
previously emaciated, but without any marked ailment.The post-mortem
examination was made on the 28th.The brain was somewhat softer than
natural, but otherwise healthy.There was no abnormal vascularity of
the membranes of the brain, and no serous effusion within the cranium.The mucous membrane of the intestines had nearly the normal color
throughout, but it seemed somewhat thickened and softened; the solitary
glands of the colon were prominent.The patches of Peyer were not
distinct.In the New York Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum an infant twenty
months old, previously healthy, was seized with cholera infantum on the
25th of June, 1864.The alvine evacuations, as is usual with this
disease, were frequent and watery, and attended by obstinate vomiting.Death occurred in slight spasms in thirty-six hours.The exciting cause
was probably the use of a few currants which were eaten in a cake the
day before, some of which fruit was contained in the first evacuations.The only pathological changes which were
observed in the stomach and intestines were slightly vascular patches
in the small intestines and an unusual prominence of the solitary
glands in the colon.The glands resembled small beads imbedded in the
mucous membrane.The lungs in the above cases were healthy, excepting
hypostatic congestion.{744} Since the date of these autopsies I have made others in cases
which terminated fatally after a brief duration, and have uniformly
found similar lesions--namely, the gastro-intestinal surface either
without vascularity or scantily vascular in streaks or patches,
sometimes presenting a whitish or soggy appearance and somewhat
softened, while the solitary glands were enlarged so as to be prominent
upon the surface.In cases which continue longer evident inflammatory
lesions soon appear which are identical with those which have already
been described in our remarks on the ordinary form of the summer
diarrhoea.During my term of service in the New York Foundling Asylum in the
summer of 1884, an infant died after a brief illness with all the
symptoms of cholera infantum, and the intestines were sent to William
H. Welch, now of Johns Hopkins Hospital, for microscopic examination.His report was as follows: "I found undoubted evidence of acute
inflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells
(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of
new cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which
were greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending
even a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the
intestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with
post-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences
as to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the
so-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with
mucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the
appearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the
neighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially
the veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the
free surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and
also in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and
small round bacteria were found.I attach no especial importance to
finding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result
of the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is
characterized by an acute intestinal inflammation."NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be
the most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,
probably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum
which has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the
intestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the
autopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum
after a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to
the great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the
inflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized
fact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short
duration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever
and erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric
glands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum
and colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the
inflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}
infantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed
a resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;
in sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,
embarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common
toward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent
symptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which
regards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum
from the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the
gastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except
in advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does
not commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more
gradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or
some error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant
is not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from
the thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera
infantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,
provided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal
inflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as
I believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,
in my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely
distinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in
the infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease
is apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually
reported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have
occasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they
are not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are
observed in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are
due to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its
circulation.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral
vessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life
in unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious
hydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary
secretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain
cases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the
symptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with
considerable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak
into the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,
and emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other
diarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between
the two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to
which physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient
notice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when
the case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom
be expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,
{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal
inflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If
the stools become more consistent and less frequent without the
occurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse
good, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present
danger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,
or it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to
be distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer
diarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive
measures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from
the operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just
before or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and
removal to the country should be recommended, especially for those who
are deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is
required.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial
feeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should
obviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in
digestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to
prevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is
done by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative
changes have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in
the hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper
quantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her
anxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,
the surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes
fermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the
gastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice
not only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard
to the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and
cure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to
ascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We
selected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them
before and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant
took during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5
grains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing
the metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of
human milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in
fluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12
infants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,
and the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,
in the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in
twenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the
average was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five
weeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one
fluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of
five weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}
months, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten
months.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same
quantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths
fluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,
three ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,
the quantity each time was two ounces.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to
determine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of
his weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the
_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that
infants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from
160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity
required each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity
required daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and
Biedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a
smaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older
than two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants
by their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is
the amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by
Chadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with
sufficient exactness the amount of food required.Some infants, like adults, need more food than others, so that there
can be no exact schedule of the quantity which they require at each
feeding; but while in the first and second months they do not need more
than from one to one and a half fluidounces at each feeding, whether of
breast-milk, or of cow's milk prepared so as to resemble as closely as
possible human milk, infants as they grow older and their stomachs
enlarge can take food in larger quantity, and therefore require less
frequent feeding.Under the age of two months the stomach is so small
that it cannot receive much more than one or one and a half fluidounces
without undue distension.At the age of six months it can probably
receive and digest without discomfort three ounces, and in the last
half of the first year even four ounces.Infants nourished at the
breast should be allowed to nurse every two hours in the daytime,
whatever the age, after the second month, but less frequently at night,
for frequent nursing promotes the secretion of milk, and the milk is of
better quality than when it is long retained in the breast.If by the
fifth or sixth month mothers or wet-nurses find, as is frequently the
case, that they do not have sufficient milk, other food should be given
in addition, perhaps after each second nursing or every fourth hour.The kind of food which it is best to employ to supplement the nursing
will be mentioned under the head of curative measures.By knowledge on
the part of the mother and nurse of the dietetic needs of the infant,
and by consequent judicious alimentation, and by measures also to
procure the utmost purity of the air, there can be no doubt that the
summer diarrhoea may to a great extent be prevented.Curative Treatment.--The indications for treatment are--1st, to provide
the best possible food; 2d, to procure pure air; 3d, to aid the
digestive function of the infant; 4th, to employ such medicinal agents
as can be safely given to check the diarrhoea and cure the intestinal
catarrh.{748} The infant with this disease is thirsty, and is therefore apt to
take more nutriment in the liquid form than it requires for its
sustenance.If nursing, it craves the breast, or if weaned, craves the
bottle, at short intervals to relieve the thirst.No more nutriment
should be allowed than is required for nutrition, for the reason stated
above, and the thirst may best be relieved by a little cold water,
gum-water, or barley-water, to which a few drops of brandy or whiskey
are added.Since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea is the use of improper food, it is obviously very important
for the successful treatment of this disease that the food should be of
the right kind, properly prepared, and given in proper quantity.I need
not repeat that for infants under the age of one year no food is so
suitable as breast-milk, and one affected with the diarrhoea and
remaining in the city should, if possible, at least if under the age of
ten months, be provided with breast-milk.It can be more satisfactorily
treated and the chances of its recovery are much greater if it be
nourished with human milk than by any other kind of diet.If, however,
the mother's milk fail or become unsuitable from ill-health or
pregnancy, and on account of family circumstances a wet-nurse cannot be
procured, the important and difficult duty devolves upon the physician
of deciding how the infant should be fed.In order to solve this
problem it will be well to recall to mind the part performed in the
digestive function by the different secretions which digest food:

1st.It converts starch into glucose
or grape-sugar.It has no effect upon fat or the protein group.It is
the secretion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands,
which in infants under the age of three months are very small, almost
rudimentary.The two parotid glands at the age of one month weigh only
thirty-four grains.The power to convert starch into sugar possessed by
saliva is due to a ferment which it contains called ptyalin.The gastric juice is a thin, nearly transparent, and colorless
fluid, acid from the presence of a little hydrochloric acid.It
produces no change in starch, grape-sugar, or the fats, except that it
dissolves the covering of the fat-cells.Its function is to convert the
proteids into peptone, which is effected by its active principle,
termed pepsin.The bile is alkaline and neutralizes the acid product of gastric
digestion.It forms soaps with the
fatty acids and has a slight emulsifying action on fat.The soaps are
said to promote the emulsion of fat.Their emulsifying power is
believed to be increased by admixture with the pancreatic secretion.Moreover, the absorption of oil is facilitated by the presence of bile
upon the surface through which it passes.The pancreatic juice appears to have the function of digesting
whatever alimentary substance has escaped digestion by the saliva,
gastric juice, and bile.It is a clear, viscid liquid of alkaline
reaction.It converts proteids
into peptones and emulsifies fats.While the gastric juice requires an
acid medium for the performance of its digestive function, the
pancreatic juice requires one that is alkaline.This important fact
should be borne in mind, that such a mistake as presenting pepsin with
chalk mixture, or the extractum pancreatis with dilute muriatic acid,
may be avoided.The intestinal secretions are mainly from the crypts of
Lieberkuhn, and their action in the digestive process is probably
comparatively unimportant, but in some animals they have been found to
digest starch.It will be observed that of all these secretions that
which digests the largest number of nutritive principles is the
pancreatic.It digests all those which are essential to the maintenance
of life except fat, and it aids the bile in emulsifying fat.One of the most important conferences in paediatrics ever held convened
at Salzburg in 1881 for the purpose of considering the diet of infants.Among those who participated in the discussion were men known
throughout the world as authorities in children's diseases, such as
Demme, Biedert, Gerhardt, Henoch, Steffen, Thomas, and Soltmann.None
of the physicians present dissented from the following proposition of
the chairman: That "all the advances made in physiology in respect to
the digestive organs of children only go to prove that the mother's
milk is the only true material which is quantitatively and
qualitatively suited to the development of the child, which preserves
the physiological functions of the organs of digestion, and under
favorable circumstances of growth unfolds the whole organism in its
completeness."All agreed that when the breast-milk fails animal milk
is the best substitute.Henoch, who was one of the conference,
expresses the same opinion in his well-known treatise on diseases of
children, as follows: "Cow's milk is the best substitute for mother's
milk during the entire period of infancy.I consider the administration
of other substances advisable only when good cow's milk cannot be
obtained or when it gives rise to constant vomiting and diarrhoea."The many infants' foods contained in the shops were considered by the
conference, and, in the words of the chairman, "Now and evermore it is
unanimously agreed that these preparations can in no way be substituted
for mother's milk, and as exclusive food during the first year are to
be entirely and completely rejected."But, unfortunately, we soon learn
by experience that animal milk, although it is the best of the
substitutes for human milk, is, especially as dispensed in the cities,
faulty.It is digested with difficulty by young infants, and is apt to
cause in them diarrhoea and intestinal catarrh.Therefore in the hot
months its use is very apt to act as one of the dietetic causes of the
summer diarrhoea in infants exclusively fed upon it, unless it be
specially prepared so as to more closely resemble human milk.The
frequent unsatisfactory results of its use have led to the preparation
of the many proprietary substitutes for human milk which the shops
contain, and which have been so summarily discarded by the German
conference.Woman's milk in health is always alkaline.It has a specific gravity of
1.0317; cow's milk has a specific gravity of 1.029.That of cows
stabled and fed upon other fodder than hay or grass is usually
decidedly acid.That from cows in the country with good pasturage is
said to be alkaline, but in two dairies in Central New York a hundred
miles apart, in midsummer, with an abundant pasturage, two competent
persons whom I requested to make the examinations found the milk
slightly acid immediately after the milking in all the cows.The following results of a large number of analyses of woman's and
cow's milk, made by Konig and quoted by Leeds, and of several of the
{750} best known and most used preparations designed by their inventors
to be substitutes for human milk, show how far these substitutes
resemble the natural aliment in their chemical characters:

It is seen by examination of the analyses of the above foods that all
except such as consist largely or wholly of cow's milk differ widely
from human milk in their composition, and although some of them--as the
Liebig preparations, in which starch is converted into glucose by the
action of the diastase of malt--may aid in the nutrition and be useful
as adjuncts to milk, physicians of experience and close observation
will, I think, agree with the German conference that when breast-milk
fails or is insufficient our main reliance for the successful nutrition
of the infant must be on animal milk.Nestle's Food, which consists of
wheat flour, the yelk of egg, condensed milk, and sugar, and which has
been so largely used in this country and in Europe, is probably
beneficial mainly from the large amount of Swiss condensed milk which
it contains.Although the preference is to be given to animal milk over any other
kind of food as a substitute for human milk, yet even when obtained
fresh and from the best dairies and properly diluted it is very apt to
disagree with infants under the age of one year, producing indigestion
and diarrhoea.The close resemblance in chemical character of cow's,
ass's, and goat's milk to human milk would lead us to expect that
either would be a good substitute for the latter.The fact that the
milk of these animals is apt to cause indigestion and intestinal
catarrh, especially in the hot months, when the digestive function of
the infant is enfeebled from the heat, must be due to the quality
rather than quantity of its constituents.The difference in quality of
the casein of human and animal milk is well known, since that of human
milk coagulates in the stomach in flakes, and that of animal milk in
firm and large masses.The German conference saw at once the importance
of the problem which confronted them--_i.e._ how to modify cow's milk
so that it bears the closest possible resemblance to human milk.They
even discussed the difference of the milk of different breeds of cows,
and the proper feeding and care of cows, but the most important
suggestion made--and one which has already produced good results in
this country and in Europe, and promises to be instrumental in saving
the lives of many infants who by the old method of feeding would
inevitably perish--was made by Pfeiffer of Wiesbaden.I allude to the
peptonizing of milk.The pancreatic secretion digests milk that is
rendered alkaline at a temperature between 100 degrees and 150 degrees
F. Milk thus treated becomes in from twenty minutes to one hour
thinner, resembling human milk in appearance, and if the peptonizing be
continued beyond a certain point, and is more complete, its taste is
decidedly {752} bitter.The process should be watched and the
peptonizing suspended as soon as the bitterness becomes appreciable,
for, although more advanced peptonizing so changes the milk that it is
more easily digested by the infant than when the peptonizing is
partial, yet the bitterness which is imparted to it renders it very
disagreeable as a dietetic preparation.Milk thus prepared closely
resembles human milk in appearance, and its casein is so digested that
it is either not precipitated by acids or is precipitated, like that of
human milk, in flakes.By this process a digested or an easily-digested
casein is produced, instead of the casein of ordinary cow's milk, which
produces large and firm masses in the stomach--masses that the
digestive ferments penetrate with such difficulty that they cause
indigestion, and occur in the stools in coagula of greater or less
size.Pfeiffer pointed out that when peptonized milk is employed "the
feces showed absolutely no trace of the white cheesiness."Milk thus
prepared quickly spoils, and it is necessary to peptonize it in small
quantity and often during the twenty-four hours.In New York City during the last year peptonized milk has been employed
largely as recommended by Pfeiffer, and with such results as to
encourage its further use.It is now used in the New York Infant Asylum
and New York Foundling Asylum.Five grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild & Co.'s) and ten grains of sodium bicarbonate are added to
one gill of warm water.This is mixed with one pint of warm milk, and
the mixture, in some convenient vessel, is placed in water kept at a
temperature of 100 degrees F. for one hour, when it is placed upon ice
to prevent further digestion.It should be tasted frequently during the
peptonizing process, and if the least bitterness be observed the
process should be suspended before the expiration of the hour.With
some specimens of milk, especially at a temperature of 115 degrees to
120 degrees, a half hour or even less is sufficient.This artificial
digestion is arrested either by boiling the peptonized milk, which
destroys the ferment, or by reducing its temperature to near the
freezing-point, which renders it latent and inactive, but does not
destroy it.I need not add that placing the peptonized milk on ice is
preferable to boiling it, since we wish the ferment to continue to act
in the stomach of the infant.In the present state of our knowledge of
infant feeding, therefore, we can recommend no better substitute for
human milk than peptonized cow's milk.Leeds recommended the following formula for peptonizing milk in his
very instructive remarks made before the New York County Medical
Association, July 16, 1884.In order that no mistake might be made, I
wrote to him for his formula, which he kindly sent me.The following is
an extract from his letter: "The formula which I ventured to suggest
for the preparation of humanized cow's milk was as follows: 1 gill of
cow's milk, fresh and unskimmed; 1 gill of water; 2 tablespoonfuls of
rich cream; 200 grains of milk-sugar; 1-1/2 grains of extractum
pancreatis; 4 grains of sodium bicarbonate.Put this in a
nursing-bottle; place the bottle in water made so warm that the whole
hand cannot be held in it without pain longer than one minute.Keep the
milk at this temperature for exactly twenty minutes.The milk should be
prepared just before using."The object is of course to provide from cow's milk a food which will be
the nearest possible approximation to healthy human milk; and this
{753} appears to be achieved by the peptonizing process.Certainly,
what physicians have long been desiring--namely, some mode of preparing
cow's milk so that its casein will coagulate in flakes like that of
human milk--has been obtained by peptonizing.It is a common error to expect too much of a new remedy which has a
real value, and we must not expect that all patients not in an utterly
hopeless state will begin to improve as soon as peptonized milk is
prepared for them, or that it is a full and exact substitute for human
milk, so that wet-nurses may be dispensed with.Healthy human milk is
the best of all food for infants under the age of twelve months, and
should always be preferred when it can be obtained, but we claim that
peptonized milk is a most useful addition to the dietetic preparations
for infants, probably surpassing in value the best of those in the
shops.We employ it in the belief that it affords important aid in
curing the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Who first
formulated and recommended the process of peptonizing milk I am not
able to state, but I am informed that Roberts of Great Britain called
attention to it as a means of improving milk at a time antedating the
German conference.Milk from healthy, properly-fed cows may be prepared without
peptonizing, so as to agree with many infants except in the warmest
weather, but is obviously less easily digested than peptonized milk.It
should be diluted as follows with water boiled so as to free it from
germs: In the first week after birth one-fourth milk with the addition
of a little sugar.The milk should be gradually increased, so that it
is one-third by the end of the fourth week, one-half by the end of the
third month, and two-thirds to three-fourths by the end of the sixth
month.After the sixth month it is still proper to add one-fourth
water, but pure milk may be given.Before peptonizing--which, as we have seen, digests the casein to a
great extent, and changes that which is not digested so that it
coagulates in flakes in the stomach like breast-milk--was resorted to,
it was customary to use a thin barley- or oat-water in place of the
water used for diluting the milk.One heaped teaspoonful of barley
flour to two tablespoonfuls of water make a gruel of proper
consistence.A little farinaceous substance added to the milk by
mechanically separating the particles of casein tends to prevent their
coagulation in large and firm masses.This was the theory which
explained the beneficial action of the admixture.If for any reason
peptonized milk be not employed, milk prepared in the way I have
mentioned, by admixture with a farinaceous substance, is probably the
next best substitute for human milk.It is very important to determine when and how farinaceous foods shall
be given in this disease.It is well known that infants under the age
of three months digest starch with difficulty and only in small
quantity, since the salivary and pancreatic glands which secrete the
ferments which digest starch are almost rudimentary at that age.The
artificial digestion of starch is, however, easily accomplished.Among
the last labors of the renowned chemist Baron Liebig was the
preparation of a food for infants in which the starch is digested and
transformed into grape-sugar, and thus infants at any age who are fed
with it are relieved of the burden of digesting it.The baron led the
way which has been so successfully followed since in the artificial
digestion of foods.A considerable part of the starch {754} in wheat
flour is converted into grape-sugar by the prolonged action of heat.I
frequently recommend that from three to five pounds of wheat flour be
packed dry in a firm muslin bag, so as to form a ball, and be placed in
water sufficient to cover it constantly and the bag kept over the fire
three or four days.During the nights the fire may go out for a few
hours.At the expiration of this time the external part, which is wet,
being peeled off, the remainder resembles a lump of yellowish chalk.The flour grated from it gives a decided reaction of sugar by Fehling's
test.Starch is also quickly transformed into glucose by the action of
the diastase of malt, which indeed Liebig employed.If to a gruel of
barley flour, oatmeal, or other farinaceous substance, when hot, a
little of a good preparation of extract of malt, such as that prepared
by Trommer & Co.at Fremont, Ohio, which acts promptly, or by Reed &
Carnrick, be added, it becomes thinner.It is claimed that the starch
is thus quickly converted into glucose; which seems doubtful.It is,
however, so modified that it is apparently more readily digested and
assimilated.Farinaceous substances thus prepared may be employed with
peptonized or other milk.Infants frequently do better with this
admixture than when either the milk or gruel is used separately.Of the foods contained in the shops which have been most prescribed,
and which have apparently been useful in certain cases, I may mention
those which have been prepared according to Liebig's formula, of which
there are several, the analyses of which I have given, and Nestle's
farina.In the use of those foods which contain no milk, as Ridge's
food, Imperial granum, etc., it is recommended that milk be added,
while for such as contain condensed milk, as Nestle's and the
Anglo-Swiss food, only water should be employed.The Anglo-Swiss food
contains about 60 per cent.each
of oatmeal and Russian wheat flour.It gives an acid reaction, unlike
Nestle's, which is alkaline.When Biedert's cream conserve was
announced great expectations were awakened from the fact that the
inventor is an authority in paediatrics, but, unfortunately, they have
not been realized in this country.Much of Biedert's conserve when it
reaches us is spoiled, and the directions for its use are too
complicated for ordinary family use, since a different mixture is
required for each month of the infant's age.I have employed this food,
but, with Henoch, "could not convince myself that it is more
efficacious than cow's milk."I am informed that the sale of it in this
country has ceased.Condensed milk is largely used in the feeding of infants.The milk is
condensed in vacuo to one-third or one-fifth its volume, heated to 100
degrees C.to kill any fungus which it contains, and
38 to 40 per cent.of cane-sugar is added to preserve it.In the first
month one part of milk should be added to sixteen of water, and the
proportion of water should be gradually reduced as the infant becomes
older.The large amount of sugar which condensed milk, preserved in
cans, contains renders it unsuitable in the dietetic role of the summer
diarrhoea of infants.The sugar is apt to produce acid fermentation and
diarrhoea in hot weather.Borden's condensed milk, freshly prepared, as
dispensed from the wagons, contains, I am informed by the agent, no
cane-sugar or other foreign substance, and on this account is to be
preferred to that in the cans.It is cow's milk of good quality, from
which 75 to 79 per cent.of the water {755} has been removed under
vacuum.The sole advantage which it possesses--and it is an important
one--is that it resists fermentation longer than the ordinary milk.To select the best food for the infant from this considerable number of
dietetic preparations is one of the most important duties of the
physician.If called to an infant unfortunately deprived of wholesome
breast-milk, and suffering in consequence from indigestion and
diarrhoea, what diet shall we recommend?My recommendation would be as
follows: Use cow's milk of the best possible quality and peptonized in
the manner stated above, and peptonized in small quantity at a time,
such as a pint, or, better, half a pint.This may be the sole food till
the age of five or six months.Unfortunately, in the cities the milk
that is delivered in the morning is the milking of the preceding
evening, mixed with that of the preceding morning, brought often many
miles from the farms where it is produced.Milk twelve and twenty-four
hours old, notwithstanding the use of ice around the milk-cans, is apt
to undergo some fermentative change before it reaches the nursery.This
prevents the preparation of the best quality of peptonized milk, so
that in some instances during the heated term I have found that the
peptonized milk did not agree as well as the condensed milks, like
Borden's or Nestle's food.Not a few infants suffering from diarrhoeal
maladies seem to do better if some farinaceous food properly prepared
be added to the peptonized milk than when the milk is used alone.It is
better, I think, that the starch, or a considerable part of the starch,
be converted into glucose before the admixture.This can be done if a
few pounds of wheat flour be pressed dry in a bag, so as to form a
ball, and boiled three or four days, as I have elsewhere recommended.The flour grated from the mass gives a decided sugar reaction to
Fehling's test.For infants under the age of six months one
tablespoonful of the flour thus prepared should be mixed with twelve
tablespoonfuls of water and boiled.When it has been removed from the
fire and become tepid, a small quantity of a good extract of malt, as
Trommer's or Reed & Carnrick's, may advantageously be added to the
gruel to increase the transformation of starch and render it more
digestible.To avoid the time and trouble of preparing the food in this
manner, one of the foods contained in the shops, in which the starch
has been transformed into glucose by the employment of Baron Liebig's
formula, may be used, as Mellin's or Horlick's, instead of the wheat
flour prepared by long boiling.The older the child, the thicker should
be the gruel.Beef-, mutton-, or chicken-tea should not be employed, at least as it
is ordinarily made, since it is too laxative.Occasionally, for the
older infants, we may allow the expressed juice of beef, raw scraped
beef, or beef-tea prepared by adding half a pound of lean beef, finely
minced, to one pint of cold water, and after allowing it to stand for
half an hour warming it to a temperature not exceeding 110 degrees for
another half hour.Salt
should be added to it, and I am in the habit of adding to it also about
seven drops of dilute muriatic acid to facilitate its digestion.It is
chiefly for infants over the age of ten months that the meat-juices are
proper.A concentrated nutriment, prepared, it is stated, from beef,
mutton, and fruits, has lately been introduced in the shops under the
name Murdoch's Liquid Food.Young {756} infants with dyspeptic and
diarrhoeal symptoms can take it, and it appears to be readily
assimilated, as the quantity given at each feeding is small.It has its
advocates, and it appears to be of some service in cases of weak and
irritable stomach.But since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea of infants is foul air, it is obvious that measures should be
employed to render the atmosphere in which the infant lives as free as
possible from noxious effluvia.Cleanliness of the person, of the
bedding, and of the house in which the patient resides, the prompt
removal of all refuse animal or vegetable matter, whether within or
around the premises, and allowing the infant to remain a considerable
part of the day in shaded localities where the air is pure, as in the
parks or suburbs of the city, are important measures.In New York great
benefit has resulted from the floating hospital which every second day
during the heated term carries a thousand sick children from the
stifling air of the tenement-houses down the bay and out to the fresh
air of the ocean.But it is difficult to obtain an atmosphere that is entirely pure in a
large city with its many sources of insalubrity; and all physicians of
experience agree in the propriety of sending infants affected with the
summer diarrhoea to localities in the country which are free from
malaria and sparsely inhabited, in order that they may obtain the
benefits of a purer air.Many are the instances each summer in New York
City of infants removed to the country with intestinal inflammation,
with features haggard and shrunken, with limbs shrivelled and the skin
lying in folds, too weak to raise, or at least hold, their heads from
the pillow, vomiting nearly all the nutriment taken, stools frequent
and thin, resulting in great part from molecular disintegration of the
tissues--presenting, indeed, an appearance seldom observed in any other
disease except in the last stages of phthisis--and returning in late
autumn with the cheerfulness, vigor, and rotundity of health.The
localities usually preferred by the physicians of this city are the
elevated portions of New Jersey and Northern Pennsylvania, the
Highlands of the Hudson, the central and northern parts of New York
State, and Northern New England.Taken to a salubrious locality and
properly fed, the infant soon begins to improve if the disease be still
recent, unless it be exceptionally severe.If the disease have
continued several weeks at the time of the removal, little benefit may
be observed from the country residence until two or more weeks have
elapsed.An infant weakened and wasted by the summer diarrhoea, removed to a
cool locality in the country, should be warmly dressed and kept indoor
when the heavy night dew is falling.Patients sometimes become worse
from injudicious exposure of this kind, the intestinal catarrh from
which they are suffering being aggravated by taking cold, and perhaps
rendered dysenteric.Sometimes parents, not noticing the immediate improvement which they
have been led to expect, return to the city without giving the country
fair trial, and the life of the infant is then, as a rule, sacrificed.Returned to the foul air of the city while the weather is still warm,
it sinks rapidly from an aggravation of the malady.Occasionally, the
change from one rural locality to another, like the change from one
wet-nurse to another, has a salutary effect.The infant, although it
{757} has recovered, should not be brought back while the weather is
still warm.One attack of the disease does not diminish, but increases,
the liability to a second seizure.Medicinal Treatment.--The summer diarrhoea of infants requires, to some
extent, different treatment in its early and later stages.We have seen
that acids, especially the lactic and butyric, the results of faulty
digestion, are produced abundantly, causing acid stools.In a few days
the inflammatory irritation of the mucous follicles causes such an
exaggerated secretion of mucus which is alkaline that the acid is
nearly or quite neutralized.In the commencement of the attack these
acid and irritating products should be as quickly as possible
neutralized, while we endeavor to prevent their production by improving
the diet and assisting the digestion.In the second stage, when the
fecal matter is less acid and irritating from the large admixture of
mucus, medicines are required to improve digestion and check the
diarrhoea, while the indication for antacids is less urgent.Therefore
it is convenient to consider separately the treatment which is proper
in the commencement or first stage, and that which is required in the
subsequent course of the disease.First stage, or during the first three or four days, perhaps the first
week.--Occasionally, it is proper to commence the treatment by the
employment of some gentle purgative, especially when the disease begins
abruptly after the use of indigestible and irritating food.A single
dose of castor oil or syrup of rhubarb, or the two mixed, will remove
the irritating substance, and afterward opiates or the remedies
designed to control the disease can be more successfully employed.Ordinarily, such preliminary treatment is not required.Diarrhoea has
generally continued a few days when the physician is summoned, and no
irritating substance remains save the acid which is so abundantly
generated in the intestines in this disease, and which we have the
means of removing without purgation.The same general plan of medicinal treatment is appropriate for the
summer diarrhoea of infants as for diarrhoea from other causes; but the
acid fermentation commonly present indicates the need of antacids,
which should be employed in most of the mixtures used in the first
stage as long as the stools have a decidedly acid reaction.Those who accept the theory that this disease is produced by
micro-organisms which lodge on the gastro-intestinal surface and
produce diarrhoea by their irritating effect are naturally led to
employ antiseptic remedies.Guaita administered for this purpose sodium
benzoate.One drachm or a drachm and a half dissolved in three ounces
of water were administered in twenty-four hours with, it is stated,
good results.[3] I have no experience in the use of antiseptic
remedies.If by the appearance of the stools or the substance ejected from the
stomach, or by the usual test of litmus-paper, the presence of an acid
in an irritating quantity be ascertained or suspected, lime-water or a
little sodium bicarbonate may be added to the food.The creta
praeparata of the Pharmacopoeia administered every two hours, or, which
is more convenient, the mistura cretae, is a useful antacid for such a
case.By the alkalies alone,
aided by the judicious use of stimulants, the disease is sometimes
arrested, but, unless {758} circumstances are favorable and the case be
mild, other remedies are required.Opium has long been used, and it retains its place as one of the
important remedies in this disease.For the treatment of a young infant
paregoric is a convenient opiate preparation.For the age of one to two
months the dose is from three to five drops; for the age of six months,
twelve drops, repeated every three hours or at longer intervals
according to the state of the patient.After the age of six months the
stronger preparations of opium are more commonly used.The tinctura
opii deodorata or Squibb's liquor opii compositus may be given in doses
of one drop at the age of one year.Dover's powder in doses of
three-fourths of a grain, or the pulvis cretae comp.cum opio in
three-grain doses every third hour, may be given to an infant of one
year.Opium is, however, in general best given in mixtures which will be
mentioned hereafter.It quiets the action of the intestines and
diminishes the number of the evacuations.It is contraindicated or
should be used with caution if cerebral symptoms are present.Sometimes
in the commencement of the disease, when it begins abruptly from some
error in diet, with high temperature, drowsiness, twitching of the
limbs--symptoms which threaten eclampsia--opiates should be given
cautiously before free evacuations occur from the bowels and the
offending substance is expelled.Under such circumstances a few doses
of the bromide of potassium are preferable.In the advanced stage of
the disease also, when symptoms of spurious hydrocephalus occur, opium
should be withheld or cautiously administered, since it might tend to
increase the fatal stupor in which severe cases are apt to terminate.The vegetable astringents, although they have been largely employed in
the treatment of this as well as other forms of infantile diarrhoea,
are, I think, much less frequently prescribed than formerly.I have
entirely discarded them, since they are apt to be vomited and have not
proved efficient in my practice.As a substitute for them the
subnitrate of bismuth has come into use, and in much larger doses than
were formerly employed.While it aids in checking the diarrhoea, it is
an efficient antiemetic and antiseptic.It should be prescribed in ten
or twelve grains for an infant of twelve months; larger doses produce
no ill effect, for its action is almost entirely local and soothing to
the inflamed surface with which it comes in contact.It undergoes a
chemical change in the stomach and intestines, becoming black, being
converted into the bismuth sulphide, and it causes dark stools.Rarely
it gives rise in the infant to the well-known garlicky odor, like that
occasionally observed in adult patients, and which Squibb thinks may be
due to tellurium accidentally associated with the bismuth in its
natural state.For those cases in which the symptoms are chiefly due to
colitis, and the stools contain blood with a large proportion of mucus,
it has been customary to prescribe laudanum or some other form of opium
with castor oil.I prefer, however, the bismuth and opium for such
cases as are more decidedly dysenteric, as well as for cases of the
usual form of intestinal catarrh.In ordering bismuth in these large
doses it is important that a pure article be dispensed.The following are convenient and useful formulae for a child of one
year: {759}

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidrachm xiv.Shake thoroughly and give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Aq.cinnamomi,        fluidounce iss.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.X. Dose, one powder every three hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.Cholera infantum requires similar treatment to that which is proper for
the ordinary form of the summer diarrhoea, but there is no disease,
unless it is pseudo-membranous croup, in which early and appropriate
treatment is more urgently required, since the tendency is to rapid
sinking and death.As early as possible, therefore, proper instructions
should be given in regard to the feeding, and for an infant between the
ages of eight and twelve months either one of the above prescriptions
should be given or the following:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Spts.fluidrachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidounce iss.Give one teaspoonful every two or three hours.An infant of six months can take one-half the dose, and one of three or
four months one-third or one-fourth the dose, of either of the above
mixtures.If cerebral symptoms appear, as rolling the head, drowsiness, etc., I
usually write the prescription without the opiate; and with this
omission it may be given more frequently if the case require it, while
the opiate prescribed alone or with bromide of potassium is given
guardedly and at longer intervals.Although every day during the summer
months I have written the above prescriptions, it has been several
years since any case has occurred in my practice which led me to regret
the use of the opiate; but it must not be forgotten that there is
danger in the summer complaint, and especially in cholera infantum, of
the sudden supervention of stupor, amounting even to coma, and ending
fatally.A few instances have come to my knowledge in which, when death
occurred in this way, the friends believed that the melancholy result
was hastened by the medicine.But injury to the patient in this respect
can only occur, in my opinion, through carelessness in not giving
proper attention to his condition.It is chiefly in advanced cases,
when the vital powers are beginning to fail, when the innervation is
deficient, and the cerebral circulation sluggish, that the use of
opiates may involve danger.Explicit and positive directions should
{760} be given to omit the opiate or give it less frequently whenever
the evacuations are checked wholly or partially and signs of stupor
appear.Second Stage.--The summer complaint in a large proportion of cases
begins in such a gradual way that the treatment which we are about to
recommend is proper in many instances at the first visit of the
physician, who is frequently not summoned till the attack has continued
one or two weeks.The alkaline treatment recommended above for the
diarrhoea in its commencement does not aid digestion sufficiently to
justify its continuance as the main remedy after the first few days.In
a large number of instances, however, one of the above alkaline
mixtures may be given with advantage midway between the nursings or
feedings, while those remedies, presently to be mentioned, which
facilitate digestion and assimilation are given at the time of the
reception of food.Some physicians of large experience, as Henoch of Berlin, recommend
small doses of calomel, as the twelfth or twentieth of a grain, three
or four times daily for infants with faulty digestion and diarrhoea.To
me, this seems an uncertain remedy, without sufficient indications for
its use, and I have therefore no experience with it.The following are
formulae which I employ in my own practice, and which have been
employed with apparent good results in the institutions of New York:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.(Hawley's or other good pepsin), drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,                            fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                             fluidrachm xiv.M.

Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful before each feeding or nursing to an
infant of one year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.minim xvj;
      Acid.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                fluidrachm xiv.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every three hours to a child of one
year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.drachm j-ij;
      Bismuth.One powder every three hours to a child of one
year; half a powder to one of six months.I have also obtained apparent benefit from lactopeptin, given as a
substitute for one of the above mixtures before each feeding or
nursing.In several instances which I recall to mind I have ordered as
much as could be placed on a ten-cent piece to be given every second or
third hour, while midway between the feedings in some instances of
considerable diarrhoea one of the mixtures of bismuth and chalk
recommended above was employed, and the result has been good.Enemata.--It will be recollected, from our remarks on the anatomical
characters, that inflammatory lesions are commonly present in the
entire length of the colon, and that at the sigmoid flexure, where acid
and irritating fecal matter is probably longest delayed in its passage
downward, the colitis is usually most severe.Aware of this fact, I was
{761} led to prescribe at my first visit a large clyster of warm water,
given with the fountain or Davidson's rubber syringe, especially in
cases in which the stools showed mucus or mucus tinged with blood.This, given with the lower part of the body raised a little above the
level of the shoulders, washes out the large intestine and has a
soothing effect upon its surface.The benzoate of sodium may be added
to the water for its antiseptic effect, as in the following formula:

  Rx.drachm j;
      Aquae,         pint j.  Misce.In occasional cases in which the stomach is very irritable, so that
medicines given by the mouth are in great part rejected, our reliance
must be largely on rectal medication, and especially on clysters
containing an opiate.Laudanum may be given in this manner with marked
benefit.It may be given mixed with a little starch-water, and the best
instrument for administering it is a small glass or gutta-percha
syringe, the nurse retaining the enema for a time by means of a
compress.Beck in his _Infant Therapeutics_ advises to give by the
clyster twice as much of the opiate as would be required by the mouth.A somewhat larger proportion may, however, be safely employed.The
following formula for a clyster has given me more satisfaction than any
other medicated enema which I have employed:

  Rx.iv;
      Bismuth.ss;
      Mucilag.acaciae,
      Aquae,         _aa_ fluidounce ij.One-quarter to one half of this should be given at a time, with the
addition of as much laudanum as is thought proper; and it should be
retained by the compress.It is especially useful when from the large
amount of mucus or mucus tinged with blood it is probable that the
descending colon is chiefly involved.Alcoholic stimulants are required almost from the commencement of the
disease, and they should be employed in all protracted cases.Whiskey
or brandy is the best of these stimulants, and it should be given in
small doses at intervals of two hours.I usually order three or four
drops for an infant of one month, and an additional drop or two drops
for each additional month.The stimulant is not only useful in
sustaining the vital powers, but it also aids in relieving the
irritability of the stomach and in preventing hypostasis in depending
portions of the lung and brain, which, as we have seen, is so frequent
in advanced cases.The vomiting which is so common a symptom in many cases greatly
increases the prostration, and should be immediately relieved if
possible.The following formulae will be found useful for it:

  Rx.drachm ij;
      Spts.fluidrachm ss-fluidrachm j;
      Syrupi,
      Aquae,          _aa_ fluidounce j.  Misce.Dose, one teaspoonful half-hourly or hourly if required,
made cold by a piece of ice.ij;
      Liquor.Dose, one teaspoonful, with a teaspoonful of milk (breast-milk if the
baby nurse), to be repeated according to the nausea.{762} Lime-water with an equal quantity of milk often relieves the
nausea when it is due to acids in the stomach, but it is rendered more
effectual in certain cases by the addition of carbolic acid, which
tends to check any fermentative process.Perhaps also some of the
recent antiseptic medicines introduced into our Pharmacopoeia, as the
benzoate of sodium, may be found useful for the vomiting.A minute dose
of tincture of ipecacuanha, as one-eighth of a drop in a teaspoonful of
ice-water, frequently repeated, has also been employed with alleged
benefit.Of these various antiemetics, my preference is for the bismuth in large
doses, with the aromatic spirits of ammonia, properly diluted, that the
ammonia do not irritate the stomach.Nevertheless, in certain patients
the nausea is very obstinate, and all these remedies fail.In such
cases absolute quiet of the infant on its back, the administration of
but little nutriment at a time, mustard over the epigastrium, and the
use of an occasional small piece of ice or the use of carbonic acid
water with ice in it, may relieve this symptom.In protracted cases, when the vital powers begin to fail, as indicated
by pallor, more or less emaciation, and loss of strength, the following
is the best tonic mixture with which I am acquainted.It aids in
restraining the diarrhoea, while it increases the appetite and
strength.It should not be prescribed until the inflammation has
assumed a subacute or chronic character:

  Rx.calumbae,     fluidrachm iij;
      Liq.ferri nitratis, minim xxvij;
      Syrupi,              fluidounce iij.Dose, one teaspoonful every three or four hours to an infant of one
year.{763}

(Sennertus); Scelotyrbe pituitosa (Perywinger); Mucositas intestinalis
colloides, Concretiones gelatiniformes intestinales (Laboulbene);
Tubular exudation-casts of the intestines (Hutchinson).DEFINITION.--The disease is a non-febrile affection, consisting in a
peculiar, and usually persistent, morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous membrane, marked by the periodical formation of viscous,
shreddy, or tubular exudates composed chiefly of mucin, on the
discharge of which temporary amelioration of the accompanying acute
digestive and nervous symptoms occurs.HISTORY.--Although no distinct and separate accounts of
pseudo-membranous enteritis occur in the medical writings of the
ancients, nor even in those dating up to the eighteenth century, yet
there may occasionally be detected in some of the descriptions of
certain pathological conditions grouped under such titles as colic,
passage of gall-stones, tenesmus, coeliac and pituitous affections,
diarrhoea, dysentery, etc., the peculiar features of the disease under
consideration.This confusion ruled up to a comparatively recent time.J. Mason Good,[1] writing in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, groups the disease as a species of diarrhoea--diarrhoea
tubularis--and remarks that he had "never hitherto seen this species
classified, and not often described, although it occurred frequently in
practice."[Footnote 1: _Study of Medicine_, 1822.]Aretaeus,[2] in the second century, in discussing the subject of
dysentery, speaks of alvine discharges sometimes occurring of a
substance of considerable length, in many respects not to be
distinguished from a sound piece of intestine, which he regarded as the
inner coating of the bowel.{764} This false interpretation of a fact
arose from the circumstance that the membranous exudate occasionally
assumes a tubular form, bearing the impress of the inner surface of the
bowel upon which it is formed, and was perpetuated up to a
comparatively recent period by successive authors.This error befell
Simpson,[3] Morgagni,[4] Lancisi, and Spindler;[5] the last of whom
describes the material discharged as worked up into a "materia alba,
longa, compacta."Bauer[6] under the title of "intestinal moles" describes in Haller's
_Disputations_ the discharges of this disease as "concreta fibrosa
quaedam pro parte pinguedine rara abducta, membranacea molarum ex utero
muliebri rejectarum formam accurate sistentia."[Footnote 6: "De Moles Intestinorum," _Disputationes ad Morborum_,
Dresdae, 1747, p.In the same volume Kaempf[7] discourses on this subject under the title
of "infarction of the intestinal vessels," and also in a separate
treatise[8] published somewhat later.In the latter he groups the
disease with others of a far different nature, their only point of
convergence being preternatural alvine discharges.[Footnote 7: _De Infarctu Vasorum Ventriculi_, Basiliae, 1751.][Footnote 8: _Abhandlungen von einer neuer methode der hartnackigsten
Krankheiten die ihren Sitz im unterleibe haben, zu heilen_, Leipzig,
1784.]Subsequent authors, as a rule, fell into the same error, and it was not
until 1818 that membranous enteritis was discriminated by Powell[9]
from that condition in which we recognize the presence of gall-stones.Since then more correct views have prevailed, and the disease has now a
recognized place in nosology.ETIOLOGY.--As in other diseases of obscure nature, so in this, there
has been much divergence of opinion as to its cause.The influence of age is striking, as it is rarely seen in childhood or
in persons who have passed the forty-fifth year.Of my own cases, the
youngest was forty, and the oldest fifty-four.Rilliet and Barthez[10]
state that membranous formations in the intestinal canal of children
are very rare; that they always occupy the summits of the folds, rarely
the intervals, of the mucous membrane; and that they are detached in
layers of greater or less extent.Heyfelder[11] has described similar exudations under the name of
enteritis exudatoria.[Footnote 10: _Traite clinique pratique des Maladies des Enfants_, t.
i. p.[Footnote 11: _Studien in Gabiete der Heilwissenschaft_, p.Sex exerts as marked an influence as age, as the immense preponderance
of cases occurs in females.In an analysis of 100 cases, 4 only
occurred in males, 2 of which were children.All of my cases were
women; with the exception of two cases occurring in males, the same
experience is reported by Powell and by Copeland.In regard to temperament, it is undoubted that the disease invades
nervous and hypochondriacal subjects oftener than others, but all
temperaments are liable in the presence of those enervative influences
that degrade physical health and impair nerve-power.All of my patients
belonged to the nervous type.Whitehead says that those of a phlegmatic
temperament, not easily excited into action, or persons deficient in
elasticity of fibre, compose all but a very small percentage of the
sufferers from this {765} complaint, and he had particularly noticed
that a large proportion of the women have light flaxen hair, fair
complexions, and white skins.The determinative causes, whatever they may be, occasion perversion of
nutrition and innervation of the gastro-intestinal canal, principally,
I believe, by their action upon the ganglionic nerves presiding over
those functions originating the peculiar exudatory phenomena of this
disease.This condition of the nervous system once established, local
irritation of any sort may precipitate an attack, and hence the
multitudinous influences that have been assigned as exercising a
causative agency, as exposure to wet and cold, coarse, bad food, fecal
impaction, and the abuse of cathartic medicines, as alleged by
Grantham,[12] who asserts that the use of mercury, conjoined with a too
frequent use of aperient agents, is the cause of the disease in every
case.[Footnote 12: _Facts and Observations in Med.and Surg._, 1849, p.Farr considered the irritation of the intestinal canal owing to a
parasitic growth of a confervoid type (oscillatoria).This view is
supported by no other authority than that of himself and Bennett, as
nothing of this sort is recorded as occurring in the discharges of
patients of other observers; certainly in mine there was no parasitic
development.The presence of it in their cases may then be fairly
regarded as accidental, or at least unessential.Habershon regarded ovarian diseases and painful menstruation in the
female, and prostatic diseases in the male, as exciting causes.SYMPTOMS.--The most characteristic symptoms disclosing the presence of
pseudo-membranous enteritis are those arising from derangements of the
digestive organs.They are, in the beginning, vague and irregular in
occurrence, or so over-veiled by associated disorders of the
genito-urinary and nervous systems that their nature and import often
escape recognition until, weeks, and even months, of fruitless
medication addressed to these secondary phenomena having been expended,
the disease assumes such severity and presents such a complex of
peculiar symptoms that it no longer eludes identification.The disease rarely starts as an acute affection; sometimes it is
subacute, but in the great majority of cases its course is chronic.Its
initiation is marked with symptoms of gastro-intestinal
disturbances--irregularity of the bowels, constipation and diarrhoea
alternately; and dyspeptic annoyance of one sort or another--capricious
appetite, nausea or vomiting, and pyrosis, usually increased by liquid
diet.In Dunhill's case there was almost daily vomiting of mucus and
pus streaked with blood, and occasionally pure blood.This prominence
of gastric derangement supplies an explanation why Todd conferred upon
the disease the title of follicular dyspepsia.There is a sense of discomfort, soreness, or rawness of the abdomen,
especially along the line of the colon, and in two of my cases the
rectum was tender and raw, which augmented to decided pain in sitting
or riding, and the abdominal muscles were tense; a feeling of heat or
burning in the bowels often occurs, and almost always more or less
lassitude and mental depression.These symptoms aggravate, especially
upon indiscretions in diet, exposure to wet, or indeed under any sort
of enervative influences, at irregular intervals.Their persistence
finally induces grave disorders of nutrition, marked by the blood
becoming poor and thin, by sluggish {766} circulation and local
congestions in the pelvic and abdominal viscera, and loss of strength
and flesh.Yet certain patients seem to retain their flesh for a long
time, as I have seen, after suffering several years from the disease.The depression of vital powers is still further manifested in a small,
slow, soft pulse and a temperature running below the normal standard.The tongue is usually moist, pale, and flabby, and coated with a
pearl-white or yellowish-white coating; sometimes, however, it is raw,
red, tender, and fissured, or patchy from exfoliation of the mucous
coating.The gums and cheeks are usually pale and bloodless, and often
the seat of small roundish painful ulcers, which occasionally invade
the palate and throat.Grantham[13] says that ulceration of a
phagedaenic kind sometimes forms on the tonsils.The complexion usually
assumes a muddy or flavescent tint, which during the attack may deepen
to a jaundiced hue.At other times it presents a transparent or waxy
appearance.The skin is dry and furfy, sometimes cold and clammy, or, from
over-action of the sebaceous glands, greasy.There is a disposition,
especially on the chest, neck, and face, to papular eruptions or even
phlegmonous or carbuncular inflammation.The urine is high- and loaded with abundant phosphates, which in
cooling precipitate as a heavy deposit.The bladder is often irritable,
and discharges more or less mucus.According to Grantham,[14] patients
occasionally pass urine with evident traces of albumen, and seldom
containing a normal quantity of phosphates.On an increase in fever or
mental excitement a larger quantity than natural of the lithate of
ammonium is found; frequently the mucous membrane of the bladder is
found thickened in these cases.The characteristic symptom, however, of this disease is the periodical
formation and discharge of mucous exudates varying in physical
appearances and frequency.The discharge may occur daily, with every
stool, or at irregular intervals--a week, month, or longer--but usually
in from twelve to fifteen days.The recurrence may be precipitated by
irregularity in diet, exposure to wet and cold, or by excesses of any
sort.The paroxysm is marked by tormina or severe pain, which may
resemble that of colic or that of the passage of a biliary calculus,
extending down the thighs or to the bladder, in the latter case
sometimes causing retention, requiring the use of the catheter.The
pain is usually referred to some part of the large intestine.In
certain cases the paroxysm is announced by chills radiating from some
point in the abdomen or even from other parts of the body.After the paroxysm has endured two, three, or more days--usually a
week--membranous exudates, either with a spontaneous or with an
artificial movement of the bowels, are voided; after which there is a
gradual assuagement of the local and general symptoms, but the patient
experiences a sense of exhaustion or lassitude, and the tenderness of
the abdomen and the irregularity of the bowels usually persist.During the attack there is anorexia, but in the intervals the appetite
remains fairly good, and the alvine discharges may assume quite a
natural condition.In the course of the disease there is more or less disturbance in the
functions of the nervous system.During the paroxysm, when the {767}
sufferings are severe, the cast of symptoms running through the case is
of a decidedly hypochondriacal type.At times, with the expulsion of
the exudates and succeeding respite from suffering, there often occurs
a mental rebound which lifts the patient from the slough of despair to
the most hopeful anticipations of future health and happiness.In one
of my cases this transition was remarkable.This hysterical type is
common enough, and the irritability of the nervous system is still
further manifested in the occurrence of irregular contractions of
various groups of the voluntary muscles, as shown in hysterical
tetanus, general convulsions, or chorea in children, or by paralyses of
motion.Copeland[15] reports a case of a lady in whom this disease was
complicated with the severest symptoms of hysteria, occasionally
amounting to catalepsy.The paroxysms of pain recurred at intervals
between four and six weeks, followed or attended by the discharge of
large quantities of false membrane in pieces, and sometimes in perfect
tubes.The menstrual flow was painful and irregular, accompanied with
shreds of false membrane--not, however, contemporaneous with those of
the intestine.The sensory nerves are often deranged, for in some cases
there is paraesthesia--anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia--in limited areas
of the skin.There is more or less headache, neuralgic pains in this or
that nerve, or in several at the same time.[Footnote 15: _Dictionary of Medicine_, vol.The special senses do not escape; they manifest various forms of
functional derangement.In one of my cases there were constant buzzing
in the ears and perversion of the sense of smell, and in another the
vision was thought impaired and the services of an oculist sought.The uterine functions are always involved in greater or less degree.The menstruation is difficult and painful, and occasionally accompanied
with membranous discharges.In one of my cases there was a uterine
exudate, though the menopause had occurred several years before.Leucorrhoea and cervical inflammation are common.PATHOLOGY.--Despite the fact that the disease in question, without
being very frequent, is far from rare, little light has been shed upon
its pathology.Indeed, even its individuality as an independent and
distinct affection has been contested, although it is marked by a
complex of symptoms as peculiar and characteristic as those of any
other disease in the nosology.There are those who maintain that the disease consists essentially in
an inflammatory condition of the intestinal mucous membrane, either of
the ordinary or of some specific type, croupous or diphtheritic.Copeland says the formation of the membranes depends upon a latent and
prolonged state of inflammation extending along a very large portion,
sometimes the greater part, of the intestinal canal, as is evinced by
the quantity thrown off.Valleix[16] dismisses the subject summarily
with the delivery of the oracular judgment that the greater number of
cases of this disease are dysenteric, and the remainder diphtheritic.Habershon is in full accord with this view, having, as he says, seen
these membranous exudates "follow severe disease of the intestines of a
dysenteric character, and sometimes associated with a state of chronic
congestion of the liver, and often perpetuated by the presence of
hemorrhoids, polypoid {768} growths, etc."Wilks and Clark,[17] after a
full examination of the enteric exudates submitted to them, concluded
that they are true casts of the large intestines produced by chronic
inflammatory action of the mucous membrane and subsequent exudation.Conjectures have been ventured as to the exact anatomical structure in
which the process occurs.Thus, Todd[18] says that the proximate cause
of the disease is dependent upon a morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous follicles.Golding-Bird[19] holds similar language.He says: "It
is probable that the follicles are the principal seat of the disease,
for we know that they sometimes secrete a dense mucus differing little
in physical qualities from coagulated albumen or even fibrin."Livedey[20] attributed the process to a morbid secretion into the
mucous crypts.[Footnote 16: _Guide du Medecine practicien_, vol.[Footnote 18: _Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine_, vol.[Footnote 19: _Guy's Hospital Reports_.][Footnote 20: _L'Union medicale_, 1868.]Among those believing in its croupous nature was Powell, who assumed
the character of the inflammation to be specific, and the exudate of
the same nature and formed in the same manner as that of ordinary
croup.This was the view entertained by Cruveilhier and Trousseau and
other French authors.Good was misled in a similar manner, as shown by
his statement that the exudation bears a striking resemblance to the
fibrous exudation thrown forth from the trachea in croup.He says,
however, that it is discharged in longer, firmer, and more compact
tubes.Serres,[21] in a dissertation upon pseudo-membranous colitis,
confounds the exudate with that of thrush, muguet, and infective
dysentery.Laboulbene,[22] a later writer, also remarks that there are
found in many treatises and in periodical literature a great number of
occurrences of false membranes in the dejecta.Most of these cases are
referable to dysentery, to muguet, hydatids, etc., but there remain a
certain number which are owing to different inflammatory and
non-diphtheritic affections of the digestive tube.[Footnote 21: _These de Paris_, No.[Footnote 22: _Recherches cliniques et anatomiques sur les Affections
pseudo-membraneuse_, Paris, 1861.]Whitehead, in summing up his conclusions respecting the nature of the
disease, compares it with dermic inflammation.He says: "The mucous
membrane (intestinal), like the skin (and is not the one looked upon as
an inversion of the other?), is prone under certain conditions in
certain constitutions to develop products unnatural to its functions.It is not natural for the skin to produce eczema, neither is it natural
for mucous surfaces to produce mucus in a concrete form; that the
proximate cause of the symptoms referable to this disease is the
hypersecretion and accumulation of mucus on the free surface of mucous
membranes; such accumulations sheathe and prevent the healthy
performance of the functions natural to the part, and thus induce
immediate and remote results, the effect of such suppressed functions;
that this hypersecretion indicates a want of balance between
nerve-force and germinal matter, and that the nerve-force is perverted
by irritation."Simpson held similar views, and regarded the disease as a chronic
pellicular or eruptive inflammation of the mucous lining of the
bowels.[23] Other observers have been inclined to ignore the
inflammatory nature of the disease, at least as a primary condition,
and have sought the proximate cause in some as yet undefined
derangement of the nervous {769} system.Thus, Clark does not regard
the membranous exudates as the products of inflammation, properly so
called--that is, of capillary blood-stasis which has preceded their
formation--as the characteristic of such exudates is that they contain
fibrin.He says the abnormal cell-forms present arise in some other way
than by free cell-development out of an exuded blastema.Good[24]
asserts its dependence upon what he calls a "peculiar irritability of
the villous membranes of the large intestines, which in consequence
secrete an effusion of coagulating fibrin--fibrin mixed with
albumen--instead of secreting mucus, occasionally accompanied with some
degree of chronic inflammation."[Footnote 24: _Study of Medicine_, _op.cit._]

Also, DaCosta doubts whether the disease is originally inflammatory at
all."Where inflammation," he says, "occurs, is it not secondary rather
than primary, the result rather than the cause?""Is not the true
trouble in the nervous system, in the nerves presiding over secretion
and nutrition in the abdominal viscera?"Bennett and Byford represent the opinions of a very small minority who
regard the disease as simply an expression of uterine derangement.MORBID ANATOMY.--As none of the cases coming under my observation
terminated fatally, no opportunity was offered to me of making personal
investigation into the anatomical changes occurring in membranous
enteritis.Such opportunities have been so rarely met with that,
indeed, it may be said that the nature of these changes is wholly
unknown.Simpson alludes to a case of phthisis in which the patient had passed
large quantities of "membranous crusts or tubes," and in which the
mucous membrane of the colon was covered with an immense number of
small spots of a clear white color, or vesicles, which, when punctured,
discharged a small quantity of clear fluid; and also refers to the case
of Wright, in which the mucous membrane of the colon and of the lower
portion of the small intestine was studded everywhere with a
thickly-set papular eruption.My endoscopic examinations revealed, in the living subject, the
intestinal mucous membrane of a red, verging into a scarlet color,
thickened, and denuded of epithelium in patches of varying extent.This
condition does not always invade the ampulla of the rectum, but with
the long tube I am in the habit of using it was possible in all my
cases to reach a point where it existed.The extent of diseased surface
can only be conjectured by an inspection of the exudates and by
abdominal palpation.In most cases the exudate is restricted to the large intestines--colon
and rectum--and often to a circumscribed portion of them; but in rare
cases its length and quantity would seem to indicate that extensive
portions of the surface are covered.One of the most remarkable cases
recorded is that of a woman forty years old who had been sick for five
years with gastro-intestinal derangement.Suddenly the case became
acute, and after much suffering she passed membranous exudates three
millimeters in thickness and many centimeters long, weighing in all
three kilograms.[25]

[Footnote 25: _Recueil de Memoires de Medecine, de Chirurgie, et de
Pharmacie militaires_, tome xxxvii.Kaempf[26] gives another case, in which the length of the membranes
{770} discharged was sevenfold greater than the stature of the patient.In Dunhill's[27] case the patient had suffered from this disease for a
long period, and during two years passed many yards of perfect
cylindrical shape, many of them several feet in length, and
sufficiently coherent to permit of their being handled, held up, etc.In one of my cases a perfect cylinder three-quarters of a yard long was
voided.Laboulbene[28] describes the gastro-intestinal false membrane as thin,
soft, and granular, of a more or less yellow color, slightly adherent
to the mucous membrane, and when stripped off forming a yellow
pultaceous mass.He says it is first deposited in small, irregular,
sparsely-scattered patches, located on the summits of the intestinal
folds; afterward these patches increase, and cover the folds entirely
and almost the whole calibre of the intestinal canal.The mucous
membrane, he remarks, beneath the deposit is greatly inflamed.Powell believes that at times the deposit extends as high as the
duodenum, his opinion being solely based upon the clinical features of
the disease.In the first of his cases the membrane was found in
perfect tubes, some of them full half a yard in length, and certainly
sufficient in quantity, he says, to have lined the whole intestinal
canal.In examining the membranes it is always best to float them from the
fecal or other foreign material by passing the discharges in a clean
vessel containing water.Their physical characters can then be readily
studied.They are best preserved in a 10 per cent.The exudate consists usually of a single lamina, but at various points
in certain cases several superposed laminae may be observed, enclosing
between them particles of undigested food of various kinds.In most
cases the superficial layers are more opaque, drier, less elastic, and
friable than the deeper.The configuration of the exudate varies greatly.The more common
variety is that occurring in loose, transparent, jelly-like masses,
like the white of an egg or glue, tinged often with various hues of
yellow.In three of my cases I noticed also the frequent occurrence of
a thin, serous, yellow discharge.In some cases the discharge resembles
pieces of macaroni, tallow, or wax; in others it assumes a shreddy or
ribbon-like form; and in a still rarer class it is tubular, being an
exact reprint of the surfaces from which detached.These tubular pieces
are, however, more or less torn and broken into smaller fragments of an
inch or two in length when discharged.Its thickness also varies: sometimes it does not exceed that of the
thinnest film, and at others it is a quarter of an inch or more.Its consistence ranges from that degree of loose aggregation that
permits elongation into stringy, breaking masses when fished up from
the water in which it floats, to a firmness and tenacity that will
enable it to be handled without fear of breakage.It is usually yellowish-white,
but this is often modified by tints dependent upon admixture with
extraneous matters from the intestinal canal--biliary coloring, blood
from the rupture of the vessels beneath the exudate, or with blood and
pus.The surfaces of the membranes are ordinarily smooth and uniform, but
sometimes reticulated.Certain observers have described the outer {771}
surface of the tubular exudate as uniformly smooth, and the inner as
broken and flaky at some points, at others ragged and flocculent, and
in many places thrown into shallow folds, lying in some situations
across, but chiefly along, the axis of the gut.The microscopic characters of the exudate are pretty uniform.Wilks and
Clark[29] describe the surface of the tubes, examined with a linear
magnifying power of forty diameters, as exhibiting the appearance of a
gelatinous membraniform matrix traversed by a coarse network of opaque
yellow lines, studded at their points of intersection by similarly
 rounded masses.From the larger network proceeds a smaller
secondary network, and in the recesses of this were found, at close and
regular intervals, well-defined round or oval openings, with elevated
margins, resembling in size and appearance the mouths of the follicles
of the great gut.With higher powers the exudate was found in many
cases to consist of a structureless basement membrane, which in certain
points showed a fibrous appearance, owing doubtless to the presence of
filaments of mucin.Numerous irregular granular cells, as well as
granules from the breaking up of these cells, thickly studded the
surface of the membrane.In the specimens of Wilks and Clark the
surface, besides being marked by the opaque yellow lines and dots,
presented various foreign matters, such as bile-pigment, earthy and
fatty granules, portions of husks of seed, gritty tissues of a pear, a
peculiar form of elastic tissue, stellate vegetable hairs, and a
mucedinous fungus.Clark, in describing the fibres found between the
layers of the exudates, says that they exhibited a very distinct and
regular transverse striation, approaching in character that found in
the ligamentum nuchae of the giraffe.Quekett and Brooke have met with
the same fibres in the feces.The transverse division depends probably
upon beginning decay.The division is sometimes so distinct and
complete as to lead, according to Beale,[30] to their confounding with
confervoid growths.Farre[31] actually describes the formation as of a
confervoid character.[Footnote 30: _The Microscope in Medicine_, p.Here and there, in my specimens, were observed scattered epithelial
cells which were occasionally gathered in patches.Small <DW52> masses
of irregular shape, doubtless of fecal origin, were also noticed.The
cells imbedded in the matrix, according to the above-quoted observers,
consisted of two kinds--one more or less spherical, the other more or
less cylindrical.In size the spherical cells varied from 1/2000 to
1/800 of an inch in diameter.The smaller cells had no distinct
cell-walls.Some of the larger cells were filled with fat-granules, and
represented granular cells; others had a single or double vesicular
nucleus; a few were acuminated at two opposite points and somewhat
compressed.All the other cells possessed demonstrable cell-walls.The
cylindrical cells resembled in their general characters those which
normally coat the mucous membrane of the larger gut, but they were much
more elongated, compressed, and firmly matted together.Many of the
more elongated cells were constricted in the middle, and exhibited a
nucleus on each side of the constriction.The more or less spherical
cells occupied the attached, and the cylindrical cells the free,
surface of the membranous tubes.The perforations in the matrix were of uniform size and appearance,
{772} surrounded by elevated margins formed of closely-grouped
cylindrical cells, and led to two kinds of pits--one short and
flask-shaped, the other long and uniformly cylindrical.The
flask-shaped pits were about one-tenth of an inch in diameter and
distinctly hollow.The wall of each pit was made up of one or two
layers of subspheroidal cells, held together by an amorphous stroma.A
few of these follicles contained a deposit which was opaque in situ,
and which when broken up was found to consist of large flattened
nuclear cells, analogous to those met with in epithelial growths.The cylindrical pits were also for the most part hollow, about
one-sixteenth of a line in length and one-thirty-first of a line in
breadth.These walls, devoid of membrane, were composed of small, more
or less spherical cells in various stages of development, imbedded in a
gelatinous matrix.In examining the chemical characters of the specimens obtained in my
cases the membranes were thoroughly washed, when they were nearly as
colorless as the water in which they floated.They were drained on a
sieve, and presented a gelatinous appearance, much like the white of an
egg.Their specific gravity was about that of distilled water.When
treated with strong alcohol, the membranes shrank and assumed a
striated appearance.Chemical tests of tincture of guaiacum, peroxide
of hydrogen, and others failed to show the presence of fibrin or
albumen.Treated with ether, globules of fatty matter were obtained,
which were identified by their microscopical characters and by their
reaction with osmic acid.By boiling the liquid in which the membranes
had been soaked it became faintly hazy, indicating a trace only of
albumen.Faint evidence of the presence of this body was also presented
by picric acid and Mehu's test.Treated with a weak solution of caustic
potassa and heat, the membrane dissolved, leaving a little haziness.The liquid was then filtered, and exactly neutralized with acetic acid,
and plumbic acetate added, when a copious precipitate was formed.Mercuric chloride and potassic ferrocyanide failed to produce this
effect.From these and other tests used the conclusion was reached that
these membranes were composed essentially of mucin.Both the microscopical and chemical characters of the exudates of the
disease under consideration show that they are widely different in
nature from those of other diseases.They are evidently a production of
the muciparous glands (follicles of Lieberkuhn) of the intestinal
canal, and consist essentially of mucin.Perroud[32] concluded from his
analysis that they contain a small quantity of albumen, but are
principally formed of the same substance as that which enters into the
composition of the epidermis.The exudates of other diseases of the
alimentary mucous membrane contain albumen and fibrin, as well as
molecular or homogeneous filaments.The ordinary croupous exudate,
according to Cornil and Ranvier, always contains filaments of fibrin,
sometimes mucin and pus-corpuscles mingled with the cellular
constituents, which vary in character with the locality of the
inflammation.The filaments form a reticulum in the meshes of which are
contained the other elements.[Footnote 32: _Journal de Medecine de Lyon_, 1864.]Diphtheritic exudates, as shown by Lehmann,[33] consist of fibrin, a
large {773} quantity of fatty matter, and 4 per cent.of earthy
phosphates, while its structure is made up of epithelial cells united
together, which, becoming infiltrated with an albuminous substance and
gradually losing their nuclei and walls, are finally converted into
homogeneous branching masses.The cells of these masses are liable to
undergo fibrinous degeneration.The inflammation determining the
exudate is not confined to the conglomerate glands, but involves all
the textural elements of the part affected, and the material of the
membrane originates from the capillary disturbance in them.[Footnote 33: _Lehrbuch der Physiolog.Chemie_, Leipzig, 1855.]Andrew Clark[34] states that he has observed in his studies of exuded
blastema, the product of diseased action in mucous membranes, three
varieties.The first is clear, jelly-like, and imperfectly membranous.The second is yellowish, semi-opaque, flaky, and usually membranous.The third is yellowish-white, dense, opaque, distinctly membranous,
tough, and rather firmly adherent to the subjacent surface.The first
contains only the merest trace of albumen, and no fibrin; the second
contains an abundance of albumen, and no fibrin; the third contains
both albumen and fibrin in abundance, the latter in a fibrillated form.Yet it is to be noticed that in
the first variety there is no evidence of transudation or exudation; in
the second, no evidence of a true exudation; and that in the third, in
which the existence of a true inflammatory exudation is undeniable, the
only additional structural element present is fibre.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of membranous enteritis can never in its
advance, and rarely in its early stages, present much difficulty.Its
chronic course, irregular exacerbations, lack of febrile excitement,
the persistent derangement of the intestinal canal, the mental
depression, the gradual impairment of health, the various visceral
complications, and, lastly and chiefly, the peculiar character of the
alvine discharges,--stamp the disease with an individuality entirely
its own.The mucous discharges of certain forms of chronic diarrhoea and the
membranous discharges of infective dysentery are all so different in
physical character, and are associated with such a different complex of
general symptoms, that they cannot be confounded with those of the
diseases in question.The peculiar irritative quickness of the pulse of
ordinary enteritis, according to Powell and Good, suffices to
differentiate this disease from membranous enteritis.The peculiarities
of the physical and chemical properties of these exudates, already
fully dwelt upon, not only distinguish them from those of the above
diseases, but also from such dejecta as may contain fragments of
undigested connective tissue, of hydatids, or of worms.The flakes of
mucus discharged from the bowels in protracted constipation, fissura
ani, and in the later stages of cirrhosis of the liver are composed of
mucus in which are found imbedded epithelial cells from the colon and
mucus-corpuscles.The microscope will also reveal the character of the
fatty discharges that may be associated with diseases of the pancreas,
liver, and duodenum.The mucous flakes of cholera stools are composed
of masses of intestinal epithelium mixed with amorphous and granular
matter, crystals of different substances, and, according to Davaine, of
parasitic forms, particularly the Circomonas hominis.{774} Membranous casts from the upper part of the digestive track are,
in rare cases, passed by the bowels.One of the most curious instances
of this sort is reported by Villerme:[35] A woman swallowed a
tablespoonful of nitric acid, and seventy days afterward a long
membranous exudate, one or two lines thick and of a brown color, was
discharged, which corresponded in form with the oesophagus and stomach.[Footnote 35: _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, tome xxxii.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of the disease as regards life is not
unfavorable, but as regards permanent restoration to health and
strength the case is entirely different.Theden[36] and Hoffman[37]
have, however, stated that the disease is not an unfrequent cause of
sudden death.[Footnote 36: _Remarques et Experiences_, tome ii.]Abercrombie[38] records a case of death from phthisis complicated with
this disease, and Wright another case in which the patient died in an
extreme state of marasmus.The acute and subacute forms are more
amenable to treatment, and the chances are correspondingly greater of
permanent recovery, though in all cases there is a strong tendency to
relapse.The chronic forms may almost be enrolled among the opprobria
medicorum when once they have made deep inroads upon nutrition and the
vital powers, and produced that condition named by Todd the pituitous
cachexia (cachexia pituitosa).These cases may, however, be alleviated
by judicious treatment, diet, and climatic changes, but repeated
relapses may be expected as the rule under slight exciting causes or
even without apparent cause.Patients under these circumstances drag
out a life of valetudinarianism, but it may be cut short at any time by
the supervention of some intercurrent disease, as phthisis, renal
degeneration, etc., or, according to Grantham, atrophy of the
intestines.Broca[39] records two cases of this disease, one of which
lasted ten and the other fifteen years.Three of my cases have endured
over six years.[Footnote 39: _Bulletin de la Societe Anat.TREATMENT.--The treatment of membranous enteritis embraces medical and
hygienic measures.The medical means have for their object, first, the
removal of the membranous exudation when it has once formed; and,
second, to correct the conditions upon which its formation depends by
improving nutrition and invigorating the nervous system.The severe
sufferings of the paroxysms are greatly alleviated and the duration of
this stage cut short by freely emptying the bowels.The best means to
do this is by the injection of hot water with the long elastic bougie
three or four times a day, and to assist this with laxatives.Instead
of water, solutions of potassa, soda, and lime-water are preferred by
some practitioners.As a rule, the enemata cause considerable
discomfort, but in the end are followed by improvement in the condition
of the bowels.The best laxative is emulsion of castor oil, but
occasionally a mercurial, guarded by the extract of belladonna, will
furnish more marked relief.Powell and Copeland say that they have
employed with decided advantage a purgative consisting of the compound
infusion of gentian and infusion of senna, to which were added ten or
twenty minims of liquor potassae.This was repeated, so that four
stools in the twenty-four hours were obtained.Clark preferred to
regulate the bowels, when needed, with rhubarb, soda, and {775} ipecac,
conjoined or not, as required, with mercury and chalk.Good recommends
four grains of Plummer's pill every night, and the bowels kept open by
two drachms of sublimed sulphur daily.It should always be borne in
mind that all active or irritating purgatives are harmful.The bowels
by this treatment will not only be disembarrassed of the membranous
exudates, but also of any fecal collection the retention of which would
surely cause irritation, as occasionally happens even when there is an
apparent diarrhoea.This condition may be easily determined by
abdominal palpation.The relief from pain procured by free evacuation
of the intestine will be enhanced by the employment of hot fomentations
to the abdomen.Despite these means, its severity may, however, demand
the administration of narcotics.The best form will be a hypodermic
injection of a sixth or a quarter of a grain of morphia; enemata of
starch and laudanum are also beneficial.Burrows mentions a case in
which he succeeded in allaying nervous irritation by the nightly use of
thirty drops of laudanum.The patient noticed that the habitual
constipation was increased when the accustomed narcotic was omitted.Bromide of potassium in large doses long continued will also be found
useful for the same purpose.During the intervals of the paroxysms local medication of the bowels
and medical and hygienic measures should be had recourse to to prevent
the re-formation of the exudates by modifying the vital activities of
the intestinal mucous membrane and by restoring the general tone of the
constitutional powers.For local treatment the nitrate of silver,
sulphate of zinc, the sulphate of copper dissolved in glycerin, the
tincture of iodine, and carbolic acid cannot be over-prized.From five
to ten grains of the metallic salts, fifteen drops of tincture of
iodine, ten of the acid, administered through the long rubber tube, are
suitable doses to begin with.I am also in the habit of using stronger
solutions by mopping it on to the bowel through the endoscopic tube.Kaempf made frequent and large injections of decoctions of various
plants--saponaria, taraxacum, etc.--which he imagined possessed
dissolvent and resolvent virtues.Cumming[40] speaks highly of the
efficacy of electricity.Gazette_, 3d Series, vol.For the purpose of improving the general health the preparations of
iron are advisable, of which the best are the tincture of the chloride,
pernitrate, pyrophosphate, lactate, and potassio-tartrate.Habershon
advises infusions of the bitter tonics with hydrocyanic and
nitro-muriatic acid.I have found a combination of these acids with
henbane and infusion of serpentaria useful.I also employ hot solutions
of the latter acid as a local bath over the abdominal region, applied
with a large sponge.Clark speaks favorably of the extract of nux
vomica and astringent remedies.Simpson praises the oleo-resins under
the form of pitch pills and tar, while Clark and others laud copaiba
and turpentine.Good advises the copaiba to be given by enema when it
cannot be borne by the stomach.The alterative effects of small doses of arsenic, corrosive sublimate,
sulphate of copper, etc.Grantham in
the early stages of the complaint advises the use of ten grains of
iodide of potassium combined with one-quarter of a grain of morphia at
bed-time.He {776} also strongly urges the use of cod-liver oil, which,
he says, improves the strength and increases the flesh, lessens the
spasmodic pains, but does not check the discharges.Counter-irritation of the abdominal region with tincture of iodine, fly
blisters, mustard, etc.Dunhill
kept a blister open for six months without any good results.The mineral waters of Pyrmont, Harrogate, and Carlsbad have been found
serviceable; the latter, Henoch[41] says, should be preferred before
all.[Footnote 41: _Klinik der Unterleub.The case will amend more speedily and surely by the adoption of those
sanitary measures, as regards clothing, diet, bathing, exercise, and
change of climate, which have such important influences upon health.The healthy performance of the functions of the skin is of such
paramount necessity in maintaining that of the intestinal canal that
the patient should endeavor to avoid any exposure likely to lead to
checked perspiration, and should use flannel underwear and stimulate
the skin by friction with the hand or the flesh-brush.The diet should
be graded to the ability of the stomach to digest and the body to
assimilate.Our chief reliance will be upon milk, plain or peptonized,
eggs, and beef given in the various forms of acceptable preparations,
so as not to impair the tone of the stomach nor clog the appetite by
sameness.Such vegetables and fruits as agree with the patient may be
allowed.I have tried exclusive diets of milk, farinacea, and meat
without marked benefit.All stimulants, tea, and coffee should as a
rule be interdicted.Systematic exercise in the open air and change of climate to a cool,
dry, bracing atmosphere will contribute to comfortable existence, if
not lead to recovery.{777}

DYSENTERY.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.DEFINITION.--Dysentery is the clinical expression of a disease of the
large intestine, of specific and non-specific (catarrhal) origin and
form; characterized by hyperaemia, infiltration, and necrosis
(ulceration) of its mucous membrane; distinguished by discharges of
mucus, blood, pus, and tissue-debris; and attended with griping and
expulsive pains (tormina and tenesmus).ETYMOLOGY.--The name is compounded of the two Greek words [Greek: dys
enteron], which, though untranslatable literally into English, have
long since received the exact Latin equivalent, difficultas
intestinorum.With appropriate alteration the same name is still
employed in every civilized language in the common as well as the
classical description of the disease.The French synonym, colite,
locates the anatomical seat of the disease, while the German Ruhr and
the English flux express one of its cardinal symptoms, the frequency
(flow) of the evacuations.HISTORY.--Ancient.--In its clinical history dysentery is one of the
oldest known diseases, the name being found in common use before the
time of Hippocrates, as in the often-quoted passage from Herodotus (443
B.C.), who relates that it and the plague reduced the army of Xerxes on
the desert plains of Thessaly.Fayrer informs us that in the ancient system of Hindoo medicine of the
Ayur Veda, and in the commentaries of Dhanwantari, Charaka, and
Sussutra, which carry us back nearly three thousand years, and in later
Sanskrit writers, dysentery is described by the name of atisar, under
two forms--amapake, or acute, and pakistar, or chronic; these again are
subdivided into six varieties, ascribed by those ancient sages to
changes in air, bile, phlegm, food, or to perturbations of the emotions
and passions.makes frequent reference to the disease, the
nature of which he regards as a descent of the humors from the brain."Men of a phlegmatic temperament are liable to have dysenteries," he
says, "and women also, from the humidity of their bodies, the phlegm
descending downward from the brain.""The disease is caused," he says more exactly in another place, "by the
overflow of phlegm and bile to the veins of the belly, producing
ulceration and erosion of the intestine."In his country, at least, it
seemed most to prevail in spring, but it was clearly connected with the
heat and moisture of this season in Greece--prime factors everywhere in
the genesis of the disease: "For when suffocating heat sets in all of a
{778} sudden while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers and by
the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth, which
is thus soaked by the rain and heated by a burning sun, while at the
same time men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor is the brain
properly dried."Of the prognosis he observes with great acumen,
"Dysenteries when they set in with fever... or with inflammation of
the liver and hypochondrium or of the stomach,... all these are bad.But such dysenteries as are of a beneficial nature and are attended
with blood and scrapings of the bowels cease on the seventh or
thirtieth day, or within that period.In such cases even a pregnant
woman may recover and not suffer abortion;" whereas, "dysentery if it
commence with black bile is mortal."Galen comments upon this statement
that such a discharge is as incurable as cancer.The practitioner of
our day will interpret this assertion, which was repeated with singular
unanimity by all the writers of antiquity, with the belief that the
black bile was blood, and that such cases really were cancers.Indeed,
Paulus AEgineta distinctly says, "Dysentery arising from black bile is
necessarily fatal, as indicating an ulcerated cancer."Thus, although dysentery is among the oldest of the known maladies, and
was recognized then as now by the same symptoms, the disease was by no
means closely defined or differentiated in ancient times.As Ackermann
long ago pointed out, many other affections were included under the
term dysentery, and some of the symptoms of true dysentery, notably the
tenesmus, were raised to the dignity of distinct diseases.The gravity of the so-called lotura carnea, the fleshy stools, was
fully appreciated by Hippocrates, as is evidenced by the remark that
"if in a person ill of dysentery substances resembling flesh be
discharged from the bowels, it is a mortal symptom."Fleshy masses,
[Greek: xysmata], scrapings of the guts (originally epidermic
exfoliations from the bodies of gladiators, used in pills as a tonic),
were frequently alluded to by the older writers, more especially by
Aretaeus, in description of the discharges of dysentery.Hippocrates
was also aware of the fact that dysentery may be a secondary as well as
a primary malady."One may expect," he says in speaking of the victims
of gangrene, "that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for
dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of
hemorrhage from wounds."Finally, Hippocrates recognized the effects of
emesis in relief of the disease with the remark in one of his aphorisms
that a spontaneous vomiting cures dysentery.Celsus (25 B.C.-45 A.D.), the great encyclopaedist, whose works
"constitute the greatest literary monument since the days of
Hippocrates," compiles all the information obtained up to his time; but
it is plain as regards dysentery, though he defines it in terms that
might stand in a modern text-book, that he has nothing new to add to
the knowledge of the Hippocratic school.He named the disease from one
of its most prominent symptoms, tormina (tenesmus he considered a
separate affection), speaks of the stools as being mixed with mucus and
fleshy masses, and in its treatment especially enjoins rest, "as all
motion proves injurious to the ulcer."), of all the authors of antiquity, wrote the most
perfect and at the same time the most picturesque account of the morbid
anatomy and symptomatology of this disease.The gross appearance of the
ulcers in the intestine and the common character of the discharges he
{779} describes with the accuracy of the modern pathologist and the
ardor of the true clinician.He speaks of the superficial, the
deep-seated, the irritable, and the callous ulcer.There is, he says,
"another larger species of ulcers, with thick edges, rough, unequal,
callous, as we would call a knot of wood; these are difficult to cure,
for they do not readily cicatrize, and the cicatrices are easily
dissolved."Their tendency to arrest and renewal and their general and
local effects he notices at length."There may be a postponement of
their spreading for a long time," he says, "various changes taking
place in the ulcers, some subsiding and others swelling up like waves
in the sea.Such is the course of the ulcers; but if nature stand out
and the physician co-operate, the spreading may indeed be stopped, and
a fatal termination is not apprehended, but the intestines remain hard
and callous, and the recovery of such cases is protracted."Vivid
descriptions he gives of the stools: "Sometimes they are like chopped
tallow, sometimes merely mucus, prurient, small, round, pungent,
causing frequent dejections and a desire not without a pleasurable
sensation, but with very scanty evacuations."Again, they are "fetid
like a mortification;" composed of "food now undigested, as if only
masticated by voracious teeth,... the dejection being discharged with
much flatulence and noise; it has the appearance of being larger than
its actual amount."attempted to correct the pathology of his
contemporaries, who considered all bloody discharges dysenteric.There
are four distinct varieties of bloody stools, he claims, only one of
which, that due to ulceration of the intestine, deserves to be called
dysentery.The bilious stool he derived from melancholy, and the fleshy
stool from disease of the liver.But, though Galen regarded the
presence of blood as a necessity, he was well aware of the fact that
the stools contained ingredients other than blood.It was Galen who
first used the word scybala ([Greek: schybala], feces) to express the
small, solid masses of excrementitious matter often voided with the
stools.In his treatment of the disease he made much use of the various
drying earths, the Samian, Lemnian, Armenian, the sources of which he
made long journeys to visit in order to become better acquainted with
their properties, and which are better substituted in our day by
bismuth, chalk, magnesia, and the carbonate of iron.It is the
distinguished merit of Galen to have called special attention to the
anatomical seat of the disease.Ulceration of the intestine he claimed
as the very essence of the disease, and all the physicians of his day,
he maintained, regarded as dysenteric only such cases as are attended
with ulceration.Galen was the exponent of the flower of Grecian, we might say of
ancient, medicine.With very few exceptions, the later writers, if they
do not obscure the original text with their speculations, are content
to simply paraphrase the observations of their predecessors, and the
subsequent contributions to the ancient history of dysentery may be
briefly summed up in a few additional notes.Coelius Aurelianus (400 A.D.)adopted the humoralistic doctrine of
Hippocrates and regarded dysentery as an intestinal rheumatism
(catarrh) with ulceration.He seems to have been the first author to
recognize the cardinal fact that dysentery, notwithstanding the number
of its stools, should be classed with the diseases which constipate the
bowels, or, as it {780} was centuries later aptly put by Stoll, "ut
hanc morbis adnumeres alvum potius occludentibus," and he blames
Erasistratus for using nothing but astringents, whereas many cases of
dysentery require laxatives.It is worthy of note that Coelius
Aurelianus ascribes the first use of opium in the treatment of
dysentery to Diocles of Carystus (300 B.C.), who administered the juice
of poppies combined with galls.By the time of Galen opium was so
freely used in the treatment of the fluxes as to call for protest
against its abuse.Alexander of Tralles (575 A.D.)is often credited as having been the
first to locate the disease in the large intestine.The truth is, he
suggested various rules by which the seat of the disease, whether in
the small or large intestine, might be definitely determined.But none
of these rules--the seat of the pain, for instance, whether above or
below the umbilicus, and the interval of time between the pain and
discharges, whether long or short--possess the least diagnostic value
or add to the attempts in this direction of previous writers--Aretaeus,
Archigenes, and Galen.Like these, his predecessors, he recognized an
hepatic dysentery with discharges of bloody serum, which he attributed
with them to atony of the liver, but more boldly than they, and with
characteristic independence, he ventured to treat his patients with
fresh vegetables and fruits, damsons and grapes.Paul of AEgina (660 A.D.)locates the disease in the rectum, and gives
a graphic account of its symptomatology.He made the mistake of many
later practitioners in regarding as a separate disease a symptom,
tenesmus, which he describes as an irresistible desire of evacuation,
"discharging nothing but some bloody humor, which is the cause of the
whole complaint, being an oedematous inflammation of the rectum which
creates the impression of feces lodged in the intestine and a desire of
evacuation.""Dysentery," he continues, "is an ulceration of the
intestines, sometimes arising from the translation of tenesmus, and
sometimes being of itself the primary affection; and is attended with
evacuations at first bilious and of various colors, then accordingly
bloody, and at last ichorous, like that which runs from dead bodies."In curious contrast to these accurate observations is the absurd
suggestion of an obsolete therapy (Galen), that the dried dung of dogs
who had eaten bones, when drank in milk which has been curdled by
having heated pebbles put into it, is of great service; but as an
offset to this freak of fantasy is the renewed advocacy of warm milk,
fallen somewhat into disuse since the days of Hippocrates and Galen:
"And milk itself moderately boiled is an excellent thing"--a
recommendation of the milk diet which now plays such an important role
in the treatment of so many diseases of the alimentary canal.Modern.--From this brief survey it is seen that the writers of
antiquity left nothing in the symptomatology of dysentery for
subsequent authors to describe.All further advance in our knowledge of
this, as of all diseases, was now rendered impossible by the extinction
of the light of science in the long night of the Middle Ages, whose
gloom deepens with succeeding centuries and whose shadows fall close up
to our own times.The modern history of dysentery may be said to begin with Daniel
Sennertus, whose first _Tractatus de Dysenteria_ was published at {781}
Wittenberg in 1626.Sennert gave the deathblow to tenesmus as a
distinct disease, or as even a pathognomonic sign of dysentery, showing
that it is often present in purely local troubles, ulcers, fissures,
hemorrhoids, etc., or is due to disease of other organs--stone in the
bladder, tumors in the womb, etc.He recognized sporadic and epidemic
attacks of the disease, and described under the terms fiens and facta
forms which coarsely correspond to the catarrhal and diphtheritic
varieties of modern pathologists.Improper food, unripe fruits, at
least, cannot be the cause of dysentery, because, he shrewdly observes,
the epidemic of 1624 began in May, before the fruits were ripe, and
ceased in autumn, when they were ripe and in daily use.Moreover,
sucklings at the breast suffered with the disease.Nor could moisture
alone account for the disease, as this epidemic occurred after an
unusually hot and dry spring and early summer.Some other cause must be
invoked, and this other cause is perhaps the occult influence of the
constellations and planets--an explanation which he afterward admits to
be only an asylum of ignorance.In the treatment of the disease the
indication should be to heal the abraded or ulcerated intestine; but
since this cannot be done unless the cause is first removed, "the
abrading, eroding humor should be evacuated and absterged, at the same
time its acrimony mitigated and corrected; then the flux should be
checked by astringents, and the pain, if vehement, lenified and
removed."Purgatives should be repeated until all vicious humors are
discharged.Sydenham  his descriptions of the epidemic which he witnessed in
London in 1669-72 with the artistic touches of the master's hand."The
disease sets in," he says, "with chills and shivers.After these come
the heat of the fever, then gripings of the belly, and lastly stools.Occasionally there is no fever; in which case the gripes lead the way,
and the purging follows soon after.Great torment of the belly and
sinking of the intestines whenever motions are passed are constant; and
these motions are frequent as well as distressing, the bowels coming
down as they take place.They are always more slimy than stercoraceous,
feces being rarely present, and when present causing but little pain.With these slimy motions appear streaks of blood, though not always.Sometimes, indeed, there is no passage of any blood whatever from first
to last.Notwithstanding, provided that the motions be frequent, slimy,
and attended with griping, the disease is a true bloody flux or
dysentery."The efficacy of opium in its treatment causes him to break
out in praises of the great God who has vouchsafed us a remedy of so
much power.But Sydenham was too good a practitioner not to know that
all treatment must be prefaced with laxatives.For "after I had
diligently and maturely weighed in my mind," he says, "the various
symptoms which occur during this disease, I discovered that it was a
fever--a fever, indeed, of a kind of its own--turned inwardly upon the
bowels.By means of this fever the hot and acrid humors contained in
the mass of the blood, and irritating it accordingly, are deposited in
the aforesaid parts through the meseraic arteries."The indications
then were plain--viz."after revulsion by venesection to draw off the
acrid humors by purging."It was the frequent and successful practice
of Sydenham also to drench the patient with liquids, per os et per
rectum--a mode of treatment which both he and the learned Butler, who
accompanied the {782} English ambassador to Morocco, where dysentery
was always epidemic, hit upon, "neither of us borrowing our practice of
the other."Butler declared that the method of deluging the dysentery
by liquids was the best.But many attacks are cured almost on the
expectant plan alone.This was the case with the excellent and learned
Daniel Coxe, Doctor of Physic, in whom "the gripes and bloody motions
ceased after the fourth clyster.He was kept to his bed, limited to
milk diet; and this was all that was necessary in order to restore him
to perfect health."Zimmermann (1767) did not believe that improper food could be a cause
of dysentery, as in the epidemic of 1765 fresh grapes were plentifully
supplied to patients and proved an excellent remedy.He also noticed
the muscular pains (rheumatism) which had been mentioned by Sydenham
before him, and the paralyses first noticed by Fabricius in 1720, as
occurring in the course of, or as sequelae to, the disease.It was only
contagious, he thought, in bad cases, when the stools have a cadaveric
odor.But his main and most useful contributions were in the field of
therapy.He discarded venesection entirely, was among the first to
recognize the value of ipecacuanha, and objected strenuously to opium
until the cause of the evil was expelled.Hence he was vehemently
opposed to all astringents, to the use of which he ascribes the
rheumatisms and dropsies which sometimes occur.Wines and spices were
likewise put under ban; whey he permitted, but not milk, and water
freely, but always warm.Barley-water and cream of tartar were
sufficient food and medicine for ordinary cases, while camphor and
cinchona best sustain the strength in bad cases.Pringle (1772) observed the frequent occurrence of dysentery
coincidently with malarial fever, and was a firm believer in the
contagion of the disease.He claimed that the foul straw upon which the
soldiers slept became infectious, but maintained that the chief source
of infection were the privies "after they had received the dysenteric
excrements of those who first sicken."It is spread in tents and in
hospitals, and may be carried by bedding and clothing, as in the
plague, small-pox, and measles.Neither food nor drink propagates the
disease, he thinks, for, so far as the fruits are concerned, he too had
seen it prevail before the fruits were ripe.The first cause of the
disease is "a stoppage of the pores, checking the perspiration and
turning inward of the humors upon the bowels."Antimony was his
specific in its treatment.He was also fond of Dover's powder in its
relief, and preferred fomentations to opium, which "only palliates and
augments the cause."The best drink for patients with dysentery was
lime-water (one-third) and milk.This period of time is made memorable in the history of dysentery, as
of nearly all internal diseases, by the contributions from direct
observation upon the dead body by the father of pathological anatomy,
John Baptist Morgagni (1779).From the days of Hippocrates down, the
seat of the disease had been, as has been shown, pretty accurately
determined, and the same acumen which enabled the clinicians to
localize the affection had inspired them, as we have seen, to define
and describe its nature.But any descriptions from actual post-mortem
examinations were not put upon record until the beginning of the
sixteenth century, when were published the posthumous contributions of
Benivieni (1506-07).In his description of the lesions of the disease
he says that "the viscera displayed {783} internal erosion from which
sanies was continually discharged."Nearly three centuries elapsed
before Morgagni made his anatomical studies--an interval of time void
of any contributions from pathological anatomy; and so little attention
was paid to this branch of medical science that the descriptions of
Morgagni and of his more immediate successors failed to excite any
general interest or make any permanent impression.Morgagni himself,
while he fully recognized their significance, did not consider the
ulcerations of dysentery as absolutely essential to the disease, as
many cases, even fatal ones, did not exhibit them at all.They were not
liable to be mistaken for the lesions of typhoid fever, the ulceration
of Peyer's glands, because, though they may, they only rarely, coexist
in the same subject.As to the membranous fragments sometimes evacuated
with the discharges of dysentery, Morgagni showed that they are
occasionally true fragments or shreds of the intestinal coats, as has
been maintained by the older writers, Tulpius and Laucisius, but are
far more frequently nothing else than inspissated mucus--conceptions
which subsequent studies with the microscope have fully confirmed.In view of the general disregard of direct observations, it is
therefore not surprising to learn that the nature of the intestinal
lesions gradually fell into oblivion or at least became underrated in
its import.But it is a matter of surprise that Stoll (1780) was able
to declare as the result of autopsies made by himself that, although
the colon is thickened and inflamed, ulcerations in dysenteries are
very rare.This distinguished author did not at all believe in the
contagion of the disease, as he had never seen it attack physicians or
nurses.It developed, he thought with the older writers, as the result
of exposure to cold during a perspiration.He emphatically insisted
upon the frequency of rheumatism as complicating the disease, and
describes in proof a number of cases of painful swollen joints during
and subsequent to the attack.It was his especial merit to have
succeeded in dispensing with the acrid bile as a cause of the disease,
maintaining that hepatic derangements were only accidental
complications, and thus disposed, but only for a time, of bilious
dysentery in so far as it was supposed to depend upon defective or
abnormal action of the liver.But Annesley (1828) soon reinstated the liver in the pathology of
dysentery, with the exhibition of  plates displaying abscess of
the liver in connection with the disease, as well as illustrating the
displacements and constrictions of the colon which sometimes occur in
its course.The fourth decade of our century now brought in the anatomical
contributions of Cruveilhier and Rokitansky, to be followed later by
those of Virchow, upon which the modern morbid anatomy of the disease
is based; while the labors of the Indian physicians and of Copeland,
Parkes, and Vaidy put us in possession of the facts pertaining to its
general pathology.Fayrer has quite recently published the results of
his vast experience with dysentery in India, an important contribution
to the practical study of the disease, and Hirsch has treated
exhaustively of its medical geography.But the merit of publication of
the most complete chapter or work upon dysentery that has ever been
written anywhere belongs to, and is the especial pride of, our own
country.It constitutes the bulk of the second volume of the _Medical
and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion_.It is a veritable
encyclopaedia of knowledge, not {784} only upon the subject of which it
treats, but upon all subjects immediately or even remotely collateral
to it, and is a lasting monument to the labor and the learning of its
author, Joseph J. Woodward, Surgeon of the United States Army.GENERAL REMARKS.--Dysentery may be a primary or a secondary disease.As
a primary disease it occurs in sporadic, endemic (often closely,
sometimes curiously, circumscribed), or epidemic form, and is either
acute or chronic, according to the nature of its symptoms and lesions.The ancient types of sthenic and asthenic or adynamic, typhoid,
bilious, and malarial dysenteries belong rather to history than to
modern medicine.The classification of cases in general use at
present--viz.the catarrhal and croupous or diphtheritic forms--has
reference rather exclusively to the nature of the lesion, and is hence
extremely defective.Nor are the divisions (as in cholera) into
sporadic and epidemic forms much more satisfactory, in that they
indicate simply the range or extent of the disease, and by no means
define a separate array of symptoms or lesions; precisely the same
symptoms or lesions being encountered in individual cases of either
form.None of these divisions clearly indicate differences in etiology,
upon which factor alone can any acceptable division of cases be based.Perhaps less objection may be urged against the assumption of catarrhal
and specific forms, including under the provisional term catarrhal all
the cases which cannot as yet be accounted for by the action of a
special or specific cause.It will become apparent in the study of the etiology of dysentery that
while any of the factors invoked may suffice to produce the catarrhal
(sporadic) form, none will explain the specific (epidemic) form of the
disease; both forms may be alike in their lesion and signs, but they
differ widely in their cause.In other words, dysentery is only a
clinical, and is in no way an etiological, expression of a disease.In
this respect dysentery finds its analogue in a much grosser lesion of
the bowels--namely, occlusion, acute or chronic, which, while it
presents pretty much the same train of symptoms, may depend upon a
great variety of causes, as impaction, strangulation, intussusception,
etc.While any of the causes cited may be sufficient to excite the
catarrhal form of the disease, the same causes may stand to the
specific form only in the relation of predisposing agents.Or, as
Maclean has better put it, "It appears that many of the so-called
causes of dysentery must be regarded more as acute agents of
propagation than of causation."As a secondary disease dysentery occurs in the course of, or as a
sequel to (not infrequently as the terminal affection of), pyaemia and
septicaemia (puerperal fever), typhus and typhoid fevers, pneumonia,
Bright's disease, variola, scarlatina, abscess of the liver (though the
order of sequence is here oftener reversed), scorbutus, marasmus from
any cause, tuberculosis, and cancer.It must not be forgotten, however,
of these latter affections that each produces its own lesions in the
large intestine, which are not to be confounded with those of genuine
dysentery.The view that dysentery shows a periodicity of recurrence at certain
distinct intervals or cycles--three, five, or ten years--is entirely
without foundation in fact; but there is strong ground for believing
that the disease is gradually abating both in frequency and virulence
with improvements in sanitation and hygiene.Thus, Heberden shows that
the {785} number of deaths set down in the seventeenth century under
the titles of bloody flux and gripings of the guts was never less than
1000 annually, and in some years exceeded 4000, whereas during the last
century the number gradually dwindled down to 20 (Watson)--a number
which is certainly a misprint for 200; and Aitken states that as a
cause of death it has been decreasing since 1852.Geissler also
remarks[1] that the variation in epidemics is nowhere so well
illustrated as in the case of dysentery.A noticeable reduction in the
number of cases in England began about 1850, and has continued almost
without interruption to the present time, so that now (1880) six to
eight times less cases occur than in the forties.The same diminution
has been noticed in Bavaria and Sweden.In Sweden the cases treated by
physicians in 1857 numbered no less than 37,000, with over 10,000
deaths; whereas now the number is reduced to 400-500 a year, and the
mortality has experienced a corresponding reduction from 20-30 to 6-8
per cent.[Footnote 1: _Periodische Schwanderungen der wichtigsten Krankheiten_.]At the same time, it is known of dysentery that it sometimes shows an
almost freakish recurrence after long intervals of time, appearing in a
place for many decades free from the disease, to establish itself there
for years as a regular endemic malady, not to disappear again for a
long series of years; in which respect, Hirsch remarks, it much
resembles malaria.Allusion has been already made to the occasional curious
circumscription of the disease in definite localities.In fact,
dysentery, even when late to assume the proportions of a widespread
epidemic, begins, as a rule, and is confined for a time, in individual
enclosed regions--prisons, barracks, hospitals, etc.; and in the
process of dissemination it is rather characteristic of the disease to
leap over or to spare intervening territory and appear in new foci at
some distance from its original seat.A direct irradiation or linear
transmission of the disease is the exception, and not the rule.The
significance of this fact will become evident in the study of the
etiology of the disease.Dysentery is pre-eminently a disease of army life, its victims among
soldiers numbering more than all other diseases together.Sir James
MacGrigor, Medical Superintendent of the British army, called it the
scourge of armies and the most fatal of all their diseases.Aitken says
that "it has followed the tracks of all the great armies which have
traversed Europe during the continental wars of the past two hundred
years."It decimated the French, Prussian, and Austrian armies in 1792.In Cape Colony in 1804 every fourth man among the soldiers was attacked
with the disease, and of those attacked every fifth man died.In
Napoleon's campaign in Egypt dysentery numbered one-half more victims
than the plague; Kinglake says that 5000 men died of dysentery alone in
the war of the Crimea; and in our own country during our Civil War from
1861-65 chronic camp dysentery was the cause of more than one-fourth of
all the diseases reported, the mortality being at the rate of 12.36 per
1000.Woodward relates that the dysenteries, acute and chronic, with
diarrhoeas, made their appearance in the new regiments at the beginning
of the war, and, though mild at first, quickly assumed a formidable
character."Soon no army could move without leaving behind it a host of
the victims.They crowded the ambulance-trains, the railroad-cars, the
{786} steamboats.In the general hospitals they were often more
numerous than the sick from all other diseases, and rivalled the
wounded in multitude.They abounded in the convalescent camps, and
formed a large proportion of those discharged for disability."Most of
the prisoners died of this disease, and great numbers succumbed to it
on retirement to their homes after the cessation of the war.It is the
story of many a campaign, Eichhorst says, that dysentery kills more men
than the enemy's guns.The fact that it sometimes shows itself in periodic form or with
periodic exacerbation, that it is sometimes successfully treated with
quinia, and that, as has been noticed from the days of Hippocrates
down, it prevails in greatest intensity in malarial regions, has given
rise to the view that dysentery is a malarial disease.This view, which
was strongly advocated by many of the older writers, Senac, Fournier,
Annesley, met with renewed support at the hands of many of the surgeons
in our Civil War.But wider observation has shown the fallacy of such a
view; for not only may the diseases prevail entirely independently of
each other in malarial regions, but there are regions where one does
and the other does not exist.Thus Huebner quotes from Rollo concerning
St.Lucie (West Indies), a town situated on a mountain in the midst of
a swampy country in which both dysentery and malaria abound, while the
town itself is almost free from dysentery; and Dutrolan cites Reunion
as a place where marsh fevers do not occur, while dysentery is very
common.Berenger-Feraud[2] scouts the idea of any such connection.Pierre de la Martinique," he says, "where there is
not a piece of marsh as big as a hand, but where dysentery has made
great ravage more than once.We might cite also Mauritius, Gibraltar,
Malta, New Caledonia--places exempt, or almost exempt, from malaria,
but often visited by dysentery."[Footnote 2: _Traite theorique et clinique de la Dysenterie, etc._,
Paris, 1883.]The view that dysentery is a form of typhus or typhoid fever
(Eisenmann) or scurvy needs no refutation in the light of existing
knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and pathology of these affections.These diseases may often complicate, but can never cause, dysentery.Dysentery is a disease which spares no age, sex, or social condition,
the seeming greater suffering of the poorer classes being due to the
filth, food, darkness, dampness--in short, to the bad sanitation--of
poverty.Though the disease is often confined exclusively to soldiers in the
midst of a civil population, examples are not wanting of an exclusive
selection of civilians or of an indiscriminate attack in every
direction.Lastly, dysentery is a disease which may recur repeatedly in
the same individual, one attack rather predisposing to than preventing
another.ETIOLOGY.--Dysentery is an omnipresent disease."Wherever man is,"
Ayres observed of it nearly a quarter of a century ago, "there will
some of its forms appear."But the character of the form, and more
especially the extent and severity of the disease, vary in extreme
degree with the conditions surrounding the abode of man.No one of
these conditions affects the disease so markedly as the climate.It is
the testimony of Hirsch, based upon the study of seven hundred
epidemics of the disease, that no other disease is so dependent upon
the influence of the climate.The home of dysentery is the tropical
zone.It prevails in greatest frequency {787} and virulence in the
tropics, and in those regions of the tropics where the characteristics
of this zone are more pronounced, diminishes in intensity in the
temperate regions, and occurs only in sporadic form farther north.At
40 degrees latitude the line may be pretty sharply drawn; beyond it
dysentery as an epidemic is almost unknown.[3]

[Footnote 3: Shakespeare (_Troilus and Cressida_) cites "griping of the
guts" among the "rotten diseases of the south."]India has been from time immemorial the hotbed of this disease.Henderson says it is perhaps more fatal to natives than all other
diseases put together, and Hutchinson, Hunter, and Tytler observe that
it causes three-fourths of the deaths among the natives of Hindostan.In Egypt the disease is indigenous, and is, according to Frank, post
pestem maxime timendus.Greisinger reports that one-half of all the
autopsies made by him in Egypt showed dysentery as a primary or
secondary affection.It is epidemic here at all times, Roser says, and
all fatal cases of acute or chronic disease finally perish with it.Similar testimony might be adduced from a large part of Africa, much of
Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and the West Indies.It rages
"murderously" in Peru, causing a mortality in some epidemics of 60 to
80 per cent., and occurs in this country not only in the valleys, but
in cities and provinces at the lofty elevation of 8000 to 13,000 feet.Heat, moisture, vegetable decomposition, and sudden atmospheric change
are the distinguishing characteristics of southern climes, and the
study of the etiology of a disease incident or indigenous to these
conditions calls for an investigation of these various factors.It is well established of dysentery that it occurs for the most part in
the hottest season of the year.Of 546 epidemics tabulated by Hirsch,
404 prevailed in summer and fall, 113 in fall and winter, 16 in spring
and summer, and only 13 in winter.Fourteen-fifteenths of the whole
number of epidemics occurred in the months of June to September.And it
is corroborative of these conclusions that of 1500 deaths from
dysentery in the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore from 1816 to 1827, 1100 occurred in the months of July,
August, and September.In fact, the Census Reports (1860-70) of our
country show the maximum mortality in August and September, and the
minimum in January and February.The prevalence of unusual heat may also call out an epidemic in places
where the disease usually shows itself only in endemic or sporadic
form.Thus, the severe epidemic of 1540 in England was preceded by a
heat so intense as to dry up the wells and small streams, in
consequence of which many cattle died of thirst; and the epidemics of
1583 in Germany, of 1758 in France, and of 1847 in our own country,
were characterized in the same way.Interesting in this connection is
the statement of Frick concerning the epidemic in Baltimore in 1849,
who found the cases to increase and decrease almost in proportion to
the elevation and depression of temperature.The epidemic of Weimar in
1868, where 12,000 people fell ill with the disease, illustrated the
rule when it ceased suddenly on the approach of cool weather at the end
of August.But that heat alone is not sufficient to account for the genesis of the
disease is apparent from the occasional occurrence of it in the tropics
in the colder seasons of the year; in the colder climates, Russia,
Sweden, {788} and Canada; and in temperate regions during exceptionally
cool seasons, as in Plymouth in 1769, London in 1808, Massachusetts in
1817.Moreover, the temperate zone is often characterized by seasons of
unusual heat, during the prevalence of which dysentery may be almost
unknown.Thus, during the summer of 1881, in Cincinnati, the
thermometer scarcely fell below 95 degrees F. for weeks at a time, and
was often nearly 100 degrees during the entire night, but the records
at the Health Office show that while cases of heatstroke were
alarmingly frequent, dysentery was unusually rare during the entire
season.That moisture cannot act more, at most, than as an occasional
predisposing cause of dysentery is sufficiently clear from the
statement of Hirsch, that of 119 epidemics, 62 commenced or were
preceded by wet and 57 by dry weather.In truth, dryness long continued
and excessive heat have already been invoked as remote causes of the
disease.But moisture, as contributing to, or being a necessary element
of, vegetable decomposition, the third characteristic of tropical
regions, is entitled to further consideration.Annesley observed that
among troops stationed in the vicinity of rivers, canals, and places
abounding with emanations from the decay of animal and vegetable
matters dysentery became extremely prevalent and assumed a more or less
malignant nature; and Baly, who studied the disease in its famous
outbreak in the Milbank Penitentiary, remarks that "it is greatest at
those seasons and in those states of the atmosphere which most favor
decomposition of organic matter in the soil."In Africa it has been noticed that dysentery appears with the rainy
season, to disappear only at its close; and the same observation has
been made of Bengal, while in Lower Egypt the disease follows the
inundations of the Nile.Burkhardt says of 10,000 cases that one-half
occur in wet hot seasons, two-fifths in dry hot seasons, and but
one-tenth in cold seasons.Moreover, the removal of camping-grounds to
dry localities has often arrested the disease or checked its further
dissemination.Thus, Mursinna states that the removal of the army of
Prince Henry of Hesse from Nimes, where the disease raged fearfully, to
Leitmeritz was attended by its immediate cessation, notwithstanding the
fact that the soldiers ate large quantities of fruit.A statement of
Dillenius, quoted by Heubner, is in this connection exceedingly
instructive: "Dillenius had to march with a dysentery hospital of more
than 500 patients from July 26 to August 3, 1812, and it required four
whole days to accomplish an ordinary nine or ten hours' march.The
patients, extremely exhausted, were finally put into a sheep-shed.Here, in the fresh air and lying on hay, they all improved very
quickly.By advice of the physician they ate for medicine the fresh
whortleberries which they themselves had picked."Werneck attributes
the exemption of the city of Halle since the end of the last century to
the draining and drying of the neighboring marshes.On the other hand, numerous observations go to prove that dysentery is
likewise prevalent in dry sandy soils where the factors so necessary to
the production of malaria are entirely unknown.Thus, Hirsch quotes
from Harthill to the effect that dysentery never occurred among the
English troops in Afghanistan until they entered upon its thoroughly
dry and sandy plains; and from Lidell, who declared that the disease
prevailed most in Panama in March, the dry season at this place.Again,
a striking confirmation of exemption from dysentery in a marshy region
{789} is offered in the Antilles at Grande-Terre, "a wet, marshy plain
severely visited by malaria, but used by patients attacked with chronic
dysentery at Basse-Terre as the safest place of refuge and recovery."The role of moisture and vegetable decomposition may be, then, summed
up in the words of Annesley, that "all situations which furnish
exhalations from the decay of animal or vegetable productions under the
operation of a moist and hot state of the atmosphere will always
occasion dysentery in the predisposed subject--_circumstances which,
with other causes_ [italics ours], combine to generate the disease."Atmospheric vicissitudes, checking of perspiration, catching cold, are
synonyms in the present popular as in the ancient professional
conception of the genesis of dysentery."Of the remote causes of
dysentery," Johnson says, "I need say little; they are the same in all
parts of the world--atmospheric vicissitudes."And in making this
statement the author expresses the almost universal testimony of the
Indian physicians."Sudden change of temperature," observes
Kaputschinsky of the Trans-Caucasus, where dysentery is rife, "is in
this region no rarity.The sultry heat of noon often alternates with a
cutting cold wind, and vice versa.In the same place is now a warm, now
a cold, now a glowing hot breeze, and such changes most predispose to
dysentery."And McMullin says of the Barbadoes that "it is a curious
fact that this disease is most prevalent where from the immediate
contiguity of mountains sudden vicissitudes of temperature are
experienced."Didelot says also of South France, "It is not the fruits,
as people still believe to-day, which act as causes of dysentery, but
the sudden variations of the air."Ruthay remarks of the dysentery of
China that the most common cause is a chill caught by sleeping in a
draught uncovered or in the open air.Metzler attributes the exemption
of Stuttgart (since 1811) from any great epidemic to the fact that the
city lies in a valley open only to the east, which permits no contrast
of hot days and cold nights; and Seeger, in speaking of the epidemic
which occurred in Ludwigsberg in 1872 (a city of twelve thousand
population, where no epidemic of any kind had appeared since 1834, and
where 870 were suddenly attacked with dysentery) that it first broke
out in Kaffeeburg in two streets exposed to the wind, and thence spread
to different parts of the city.Exposure of the body, especially the
abdomen, during sleep or when perspiring, the sudden laying aside of
flannel body-clothes, are proceedings, Fayrer says, pregnant with
danger in dysenteric regions.A lamentable dysentery appeared,
according to Trotter, on board H.M.S.Berwick Oct., 1780, "in
consequence of the hurricane on the fifth of the month, by which the
clothes and bedding of the seamen, and indeed all parts of the ship,
were soaked in water, and many of the men slept for nights together on
the wet decks overcome with fatigue and debilitated from want of food."Fayrer also quotes from Moseley the observation that "it often happens
that hundreds of men in a camp have been seized with the dysentery
almost at the same time after one shower of rain or from lying one
night in the wet and cold."As illustrating the conjoined operation of all these various causes,
together with filth and foul effluvia, more especially exposure to
cold, the story of dysentery was never better told than by Sir James
MacGrigor, who, in speaking of the Peninsular campaign, remarks that
"the army during June as well as July was traversing Castile, where it
was {790} exposed to the direct influence of a burning sun darting its
rays through a sky without a single cloud, the troops marching and
fighting during the day, and bivouacking during the night on arid,
unsheltered plains.They felt at times every vicissitude of heat and
cold.In the rapid advance they could not be regularly supplied with
food or had not time to cook it, and not unfrequently indulged in bad
wine and unripe fruit."... The thousands of sick (chiefly from
diarrhoea, dysentery, and remittent fever) were hurried off to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the nearest hospital-station to the frontier of Portugal, a
town "composed chiefly of ruins with very narrow streets,"... and from
having been "so much the object of contest, and alternately the site of
the hospitals of all the contending armies, nearly twenty thousand
bodies were calculated to have been put into the earth either in the
town or under its walls in the course of a few months."... "It may
easily be conceived," the author adds, "in what state cases of
dysentery must have arrived after having sustained a journey in extent
from four to twenty days, conveyed chiefly in bullock-carts or on the
backs of mules, sometimes under incessant rain for several days
together."It is really quite superfluous to cite further opinions or examples in
illustration of a fact which is so universally conceded as to be
exaggerated in its general significance.Taking cold is the common idea
of the cause of dysentery, and is always a satisfactory explanation in
a case of obscure origin in this or any disease, even though the
patient may be able to recall no possible exposure.The physician
himself contents himself only too easily with resort to this refuge,
and with further appeal to the locus minoris resistentiae, as the
explanation of the seat of the disease, which he hopes to cure with the
aid of the vis medicatrix naturae.But taking cold is only a popular
paraphrase for contracting a disease, and will bear no scientific
analysis of its meaning.Mere reduction of temperature will certainly
not produce a disease whose habitat is the hottest zone, nor will a
sudden chill of the surface be accepted as a sufficient cause so long
as men daily remain exempt after a sudden plunge into cold water.Some
other factor must be invoked to account for the outbreak of specific
(epidemic) dysentery.The influence of the nervous system, the mechanical and chemical or
specific action of the ingesta and dejecta, remain to be especially
considered in the etiology of the disease.The influence of the nervous system is more directly seen in the
production of diarrhoeas than dysenteries, but that sustained
disturbances of the emotions play an important part in the production
of dysentery is shown by the greater frequency of the disease among
prisoners of war.In the Franco-Prussian war the French prisoners
suffered more than the Germans, and the records of prison-life in our
own war, at Andersonville, Libby, and Salisbury, furnish ghastly
chapters in the history of this disease.Many other factors contribute
to the development of the disease under such circumstances--in fact,
all the cruelties of man's inhumanity to man--but the influence of the
nervous system is too plain to be mistaken.The communication between
the cervical ganglia and the sympathetic nerve-fibres which preside
over the cerebral circulation and regulate intestinal peristalsis has
been invoked (Glax) in explanation of the direct action of the brain
upon the intestinal canal.Curious in this {791} connection is the
claim of Savignac, who considered dysentery a disease of the nervous
system because in two cases he found spots of softening in the spinal
cord.The noxious action of irritating articles of diet has been recognized
in the production of dysentery from the earliest times.Aretaeus
mentions acrid foods, and Aetius crudities, as directly causing the
disease; and unripe fruits have been especially stigmatized from the
days of Galen down.Decomposing, fermenting food and drink cause
diarrhoea much more frequently than dysentery, but if the irritation be
severe or prolonged, or be superimposed upon a catarrhal state, a
diarrhoea, it is claimed, may pass over into dysentery.Impurities in
drinking-water were charged with causing dysentery by Hippocrates
himself, with whom Avicenna fully coincided; and the view that
epidemics of the disease are caused in this way has been abundantly
advocated ever since.So far as running water is concerned, the
researches of Pettenkofer have shown that all impurities are speedily
destroyed, for even at the distance of a few rods from the reception of
sewage the water is perfectly safe.Nor does standing water lack the
means of purification, provided it be sufficiently exposed to the air.The observations of Roth and Lex have shown that the water of the wells
of fifteen churchyards in Berlin contained nitrates in less quantity
than the average wells in the city; and Fleck made a similar statement
with regard to the wells of Dresden.But no one in our day would rely
upon a mere chemical analysis in the detection of the organic poisons
or particles of disease.It is the physiological test which remains the
most conclusive, and the evidence in favor of the production of
dysentery by the ingestion of drinking-water poisoned by the reception
of excrementitious matter, especially the dejecta of disease, is as
positive as in the case of typhoid fever.Thus, De Renzy found that the
number of cases of dysentery "immediately decreased at Sibsagor (India)
so soon as better drinking-water was obtained from wells deeply sunk
and lined with earthenware glazed pipes;" and Payne found that the
cases of dysentery (as well as diarrhoea and lumbrici) almost
disappeared from the asylum at Calcutta as soon as the habit of
drinking water from the latrines was stopped.In face of such facts,
which might be infinitely multiplied, one would hesitate to subscribe
to the statement of Fergusson that "true dysentery is the offspring of
heat and moisture, of moist cold in any shape after excessive heat; but
nothing that a man could put into him would ever give him a true
dysentery."The relation of the action of the dejecta must be studied from the
double standpoint of the development and the dissemination of the
disease, as originating the catarrhal form by mechanical or chemical
irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and as spreading the specific form
by direct or indirect infection.By the time the contents of the alimentary canal have reached the colon
they have become, through absorption of their fluids, more or less
inspissated, and hence as hard, globular masses fill the sacculi of the
large intestine.Mechanical irritations by crude, indigestible residue
of any kind of food, more especially of vegetable food, or chemical
irritations, as by fermenting food, accumulate in this region, fret the
mucous membrane into a state of inflammation, even ulceration, and
produce the anatomical picture and the clinical signs of dysentery.If
there be a superadded or {792} pre-existent catarrhal condition of the
mucosa or a defective peristalsis of the muscular coat, which is
sluggish enough at best, the development of a pathological state is
much facilitated.And there is no doubt that the dysentery of the
tropics is increased by the bulky, indigestible, feces-producing
character of the food.The anatomical construction of the colon may also favor these processes
by its mere abnormal length or size or by duplicatures in its course.The protracted constipation of the insane, in whom the transverse colon
is often found elongated or displaced--to assume the well-known M-form,
for instance--may partially account for the frequency of dysentery in
these cases (Virchow), though the neglect which comes of preoccupation
of the mind, with the general inhibition of peristalsis, is a more
frequent cause of the constipation.Wernich (1879) sums up the action of the feces, independently of a
specific cause, in attributing the dysentery of the tropics, aside from
the great changes of temperature, to (1) bad aborts, the dejecta being
deposited in all parts of the towns or into an opening made in the
floor of the hut, with which is associated total lack of personal
cleanliness; (2) to the diet, which causes a large amount of feces; and
(3) to the relaxation of the intestine in general, permitting
accumulations of infecting matter.Upon the question of the propagation of the disease by the dejecta rest
in great measure the all-important problems of a specific virus and of
the contagiousness of the disease.It is the almost universal opinion of those who have had the
opportunity of widest observation that epidemic dysentery arises from,
or is due to, a specific cause, a miasm, a malaria (in its wide
etymologic sense, bad air), which emanates from the soil.The
simultaneous sudden attack of great numbers under the most diverse
surroundings admits of explanation in no other way.But the precise
nature of the morbific agent is still unknown.The similarity of
epidemic dysentery to malaria would indicate the existence of a low
form of vegetable life, a schizomycete, as the direct cause of the
disease.But the proof of the presence of a specific parasite or germ
is still lacking, and though its speedy disclosure by means of the
solid-culture soils may be confidently predicted, it cannot, in the
light of existing knowledge, be declared as yet.Especial difficulty is encountered in the study of micro-organisms in
diseases of the alimentary canal because of the myriad variety in
enormous numbers found in healthy stools.Decomposition and
fermentation both begin in the large intestine, so that the feces swarm
with the bacteria and torulae productive of these processes.Woodward
declares that his own observations have satisfied him that "a large
part of the substance of the normal human feces is made up of these low
forms in numbers which must be estimated by hundreds of millions in the
feces of each day," bacteria, micrococci, and torulae being found
"floating in countless multitudes along with fragments of
partly-digested muscular fibres and other debris from the food;" but
while the torulae are increased, the other micro-organisms, bacteria,
etc., do not appear to be more numerous in the stools of dysentery than
in healthy feces.The doctrine that dysentery depends upon parasites is very old in
medicine, and included animal as well as vegetable growths.Langius
(1659) declared that swarms of worms could be found in dysenteric
stools, and {793} Nyander (1760) went so far as to call dysentery a
scabies intestinorum interna; which extravagant conception would have
speedily met with merited oblivion had not his preceptor, the great
Linnaeus, incorporated the Acarus dysenteriae into his _Systema
Naturae_.Sydenham about this time (1670) expressed a much clearer
conviction of the cause of the disease when he spoke of "particles
mixed with the atmosphere which war against health and which determine
epidemic constitutions."Baly (1849) first proclaimed the idea of a vegetable fungus, similar to
that described by Brittan and Swayne in cholera, as the parasite of the
disease; and Salisbury (1865) described algoid cells and species of
confervae as occurring abundantly in all well-marked cases.Klebs
(1867) found spore-heaps and rod-like bacteria in the stools of
dysentery as in cholera, but maintained that those of dysentery were
larger and thinner than those of cholera.Hallier (1869) maintained
that although there was no morphological difference in the
micro-organisms of the stools of dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera,
he was able by culture-experiments to develop the micrococcus of
dysentery into a special fungus, which he called Leiosporium
dysentericum.Busch (1868) demonstrated nests and colonies of
micrococci, as well as mycelium, in the villi and among the glands of
the mucous and submucous tissues in the cases of dysentery from Mexico
which he examined, but Heubner (1870) was able to disclose them in
equal numbers in preserved preparations or fresh contents of healthy
intestines.Dyer[4] (1870) believes that the parasites constituting the
mildew or sweat which forms a viscous pellicle upon fruit is the agent
which directly produces and propagates the disease.Mere immaturity of
fruit gives rise only to diarrhoea.This parasite occurs in some years
more than others, which accounts for the irregularity of occurrence of
the disease.He avers that it is only necessary to clean fruit, more
especially plums, to prevent the disease.This suggestion merits place
only as a curiosity in the history of the mycology of dysentery.[Footnote 4: _Journal f. Kinderkrankheiten_, No.More important are the results of the experiments of Rajewski (1875),
who found the lymph-spaces filled with bacteria, and who was able to
produce a diphtheritic exudation upon the surface and in the substance
of the mucous membrane of the colon by the injection of fluids
impregnated with bacteria into the bowels or blood of rabbits; but this
result was only obtained when the mucous membrane had been previously
irritated or brought into a catarrhal state by the introduction of
dilute solutions of ammonia.It remains for subsequent investigation to
confirm these highly significant conclusions, which, when properly
interpreted, may explain the action of the predisposing and exciting
causes of the disease.Rajewski's bacteria, it is needless to state,
were simply the bacteria of common putrefaction.Lastly, Prior (1883)
describes a micrococcus as the special micro-organism of dysentery, and
Koch (1883), in prosecuting his studies of cholera in Egypt, remarks
incidentally upon a special bacillus which he encountered in the
intestinal canal in dysentery, though he is as yet by no means prepared
to ascribe to it pathogenetic properties.The question of contagion hinges upon the specificness of the disease,
and cannot be definitely determined until this problem is finally
solved.The old writers believed in the contagion of dysentery.Helidaeus {794} declared that he "had often seen it communicated by the
use of clyster-pipes previously used in the treatment of those
suffering with the disease, and not properly cleaned;" and Horstius and
Hildanus speak of the communicability of the disease from the latrines
contaminated by dysenteric excreta.Van Swieten maintained that
washerwomen contract it, and that physicians and nurses might be
affected.Degner saw the disease spread from street to street in
Nimeguen, while every one who came in contact with the disease became
affected.Pringle observed it spread from tent to tent in the same way;
and Tissot went so far as to declare, "Sil ya une maladie veritablement
contagieuse c'est celle ci."Ziemssen believed that the disease is only
contagious when the element of crowd-poisoning is superadded; and
Heubner states that trustworthy army surgeons in the Franco-Prussian
War frequently saw infection occur when many severe cases were heaped
together in a small space.Under these circumstances thorough
disinfection of the privies checked the spread of the disease.But it
was the universal testimony of these surgeons, as also of our own
surgeons of the Civil War, that the disease was never transported to
the civil population by any of the tens of thousands of cases on their
return to their homes.By most modern writers dysentery is given a place, in respect to
contagion, between the exanthematous maladies, typhus and scarlatina,
which are without doubt contagious, and the purely miasmatic diseases,
malarial and yellow fevers, which are without doubt not contagious.Dysentery is ranked with typhoid fever, which is contagious, not by
contact with the body, but with the discharges.It is not a question in
dysentery of epithelial drift or pulmonary exhalations, but of
ingestion or reception of the dejecta of the disease.By this
observation it is intended to convey the impression that dysentery,
like typhoid fever, is mostly spread in this way, but the reverse may
be true; it may be spread, like yellow fever and malaria, by poisons in
the air.But dysentery, as has been repeatedly remarked, is only a
clinical expression of a disease which may be caused in many ways; and
among these causes, least potent perhaps, but present nevertheless, is
contagion.For, not to mention the epidemics which were undoubtedly
spread in this way, as among the Allies at Valmy in 1792, among the
French in Poland in 1807, and in the hospital at Metz in 1870,
dysentery has been directly communicated by the use of clysters,
bed-pans, and privies in a most unmistakable way.According to Eichhorst, the poison of dysentery is endowed with
extraordinary persistence of duration or tenacity of life in the
stools; for "observations are recorded where dysenteric stools have
been emptied into privies, and individuals employed to clean them out
after the lapse of ten years have been infected with the disease.These
observations go to prove, of this as of other similar affections
(typhoid fever), that the virus or microbe of the disease finds its
most favorable nidus in vaults, cesspools, sewers, etc.When the poison
is exposed to the air it is much more speedily destroyed, but is in the
mean time of course a possible conveyer of the disease."Fayrer quotes
from an anonymous writer, "whose views are as remarkable for their
force as for their originality," the rather extravagant assertion that
"if human excrement be not exposed to the air there can be no
dysentery."{795} Knoewenagel has recently[5] opened up a new series of reflections
in his suggestion of a possible direct infection of the large intestine
per rectum, where the disease usually begins and is mostly best
expressed.He calls attention to the fact that people who suffer with
constipation indulge in longer sessions at stools and induce in
straining efforts a degree of relaxation of the rectal mucosa.The
mucous membrane at its orifice may become at the same time abraded by
hardened fecal masses, to leave open surfaces or crevices upon which
germs may lodge.Moreover, aspiration follows the efforts at expulsion,
and the air with its particles is drawn directly into the rectum, thus
affording all the conditions for immediate or direct infection.[Footnote 5: _Schmidt's Jahrbucher_, Sept.At any rate, it must be admitted that the evidence in favor of
contagion is in some cases too strong to be ignored.A single instance
may suffice for illustration: Flugel reports that the towns of
Nordhaben and Reichenbach, containing together twenty-two hundred
inhabitants, were visited by dysentery in 1873, when nearly four
hundred people were attacked.The visit of a relative carried the
disease from Reichenbach to the daughter of an innkeeper at Tauchnitz,
and from this house the disease spread over the whole place, so that in
a short time more than one hundred people fell ill.Four to six,
sometimes as many as eleven, members of one family were successively or
simultaneously affected.The use of the same bed was the surest means
of contagion.The duration of the poison was proven in an exquisite case, which is,
however, not entirely free from objection: Two children of an officer
were severely affected in September and October, 1872.In January,
1873, the house was vacated and occupied by a successor in office,
whereupon in April, six months after dysentery had disappeared from the
place, the wife and child of the second officer were affected with the
disease.To sum up the etiology of dysentery in a few words, it may be said that
few chapters in medicine are so thoroughly unsatisfactory, as the
prospect of reconciling the accumulated discordant facts is very
discouraging.Because of the singular uniformity in the symptoms and
lesions the temptation is strong to look for a common cause, and to
ascribe all cases to this cause, explaining differences by degree
rather than by kind.Such a view would find solid support in the
assumption of a specific germ, and would ally dysentery with typhoid
fever, a disease which has likewise, in all cases, uniform symptoms and
lesions, and which prevails in both sporadic and epidemic form.The
advocates of this view would fix the poison of the disease in the air
and alimentary canal (but not in the blood), and explain the existence
of individual cases, as well as the prevalence of epidemics, by
meteorological conditions as affecting the growth or dissemination of
specific germs.Nor would the adoption of this view exclude the
possibility of producing the catarrhal (sporadic) cases by many kinds
of noxious germs, including those of common putrefaction.Hot air and
wet air are notorious bearers and breeders of germs, and the law of
gravity keeps them near the surface of the earth--conditions which
coincide with the prevalence of the disease in the tropics and among
individuals (soldiers) who sleep upon the ground.If the contagion of
the disease be admitted, the existence of a {796} contagium animatum is
implied at once, for no chemical poison has the power of propagation.But the germ of dysentery has not been found as yet, and until it has
been found, cultivated in suitable soil, and inoculated to produce the
disease, the evidence of its existence remains merely presumptive.So that at the present time dysentery must be regarded as a malady
which stands in closer relation to, or finds a better analogue in,
cholera than typhoid fever; for cholera is a disease which has the same
geography, has likewise nearly uniform symptoms and lesions, so far as
it leaves any, and certainly has two distinct forms of origin--one
clearly specific, cholera Asiatica, and the other catarrhal, cholera
morbus.PATHOLOGY.--Dysentery is a local malady, but, like every local malady
if sufficiently severe, it may show constitutional effects.It is
usually gradually ushered in from a lighter form of gastro-intestinal
catarrh.After a stage of incubation which lasts from a few hours to a
few days symptoms of dyspepsia and diarrhoea set in or increase,
attended with anorexia, heartburn, nausea, eructation or borborygmi,
pain in the abdomen, and copious fluid discharges.Hereupon ensue the
pains and the discharges characteristic of the disease.Violent griping
and colicky pains (tormina) traverse the abdomen, with sickening
sensations of depression.The desire of evacuation of the bowels
(tenesmus) becomes intense and more or less constant, and the discharge
itself is attended with little or no relief.At the same time the
region of the rectum, intensely inflamed, is the seat of intolerable
burning pain, which becomes excruciating with the introduction of a
speculum or the finger.The discharges may be copious, dark-brown, thin, and highly offensive
(bilious dysentery), may contain occasional hard round fecal casts of
intestinal sacculi (scybalae), or may become more and more scant, until
with the most violent efforts only the minutest quantity is extruded of
mucus, generally streaked or tinged with blood (rose mucus) like the
rusty sputum of pneumonia.Later, all effort at emptying the alimentary
canal may be futile (dysenteria sicca), or the mucus may be pure or
commingled with pus to remain perfectly colorless (dysenteria alba), or
with blood in larger quantity (dysenteria rubra).In other cases, or at
other periods in the same case, the discharges consist of fleshy masses
composed of inspissated mucus or pus, blood, and tissue-debris (lotura
carnea).Sometimes, though rarely, the discharges consist of pure
blood, but oftener of a copious turbid fluid, which on standing
separates into a clear upper layer of serum and a sediment of
disintegrated lotura carnea.Or, lastly, the sediment is composed of
small round vitreous masses, evidently swollen by maceration to look
like sago-grains, which have been erroneously supposed to represent the
liberated contents of the intestinal follicles.The general condition of the patient suffers correspondingly.There may
be fever or there may be none throughout the whole course of the
disease, but the pain and discharges quickly exhaust the strength of
the patient, and in severe or long-continued cases lead to emaciation
and profound prostration.The skin is hot and dry; the tongue is heavily coated; the face wears
an anxious expression.The abdomen is tumid with gases, or in more
advanced cases sunken, discolored, and tender, especially in the course
{797} of the colon, whose thickened walls may often be felt beneath the
emaciated surface.The anus is spasmodically constricted, or in the
worst cases paralyzed, patulous, and livid or blue.Prolapse of the
rectum is common in children, and excoriation of the perineum by the
acrid discharges is not infrequent.Finally, a typhoid state may set in or a pyaemia occur, when the
discharges may become involuntary or unconscious, and brain
symptoms--insomnia, stupor, delirium, and coma--supervene; or the
patient may linger long enough to perish by simple exhaustion or
marasmus.Under favorable hygiene the great majority of cases of catarrhal
dysentery recover without special treatment in the course of from three
to ten days, but specific dysentery has no definite duration and but
little tendency to spontaneous cure.The worst cases are often quickly
controlled by appropriate interference, and the most surprising results
may be sometimes obtained in cases of even years' duration.On the
other hand, a certain percentage of cases is characterized by a
defiance to every kind of treatment, including the last resort, a
change of climate.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery generally subsides without
lesions, and the natural duration of the attack may be much abbreviated
by proper treatment.Specific or epidemic dysentery lasts from two to
four weeks, or, becoming chronic, continues for years or for life, with
exacerbations and remissions.Various complications are liable to occur in the course of the disease.Three deserve especial mention--viz.affection of the joints
(rheumatism), paralysis, and abscess of the liver.Perforation and
peritonitis, always possibilities, and deformities of the colon,
thickenings, and constrictions, are not infrequently left.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions of dysentery are the ordinary signs of
inflammation of a mucous membrane and its subjacent structures.They do
not differ in any essential way from those of any mucous surface in a
state of inflammation, the minor variations being due to differences in
the anatomy and physiology of the part affected.Thus, a description of
the pathological process in inflammation of the pharynx, bronchi, or
uterus would answer upon the post-mortem table for the same process in
the large intestine, and the finer microscopic lesions could be
differentiated in any case only by the histology of the part affected.A slight lesion of any mucous membrane constitutes what is known as a
catarrhal process; a more grave affection, a diphtheritic process; a
more chronic inflammation, a hypertrophic or hyperplastic process.Hence an easy distinction between sporadic and epidemic cases might be
based upon the character of the lesion found.But, as has been stated
already, it is impossible to draw a line between catarrhal and specific
cases, the same lesions being found in either form.The difference, so
far as the morbid anatomy is concerned, is wholly in degree or stage,
and not at all in kind, the specific (epidemic) form presenting the
graver lesion as a rule.So most cases of sporadic dysentery show only
catarrhal lesions, while most cases of epidemic dysentery show
diphtheritic lesions.Catarrhal dysentery shows as its first obvious alteration a hyperaemia
of the mucous surface.It is limited exclusively to the large intestine
in the vast majority of cases, and only in rare exceptions affects the
small intestine, though cases have been mentioned as curiosities in
which the {798} process has reached the stomach in its upmost
prolongation.The hyperaemia is most marked, as a rule, in the lowest
parts of the large intestine, the rectum and descending colon, but
there is, as Virchow has pointed out, a peculiar predisposition to
affection at the seat of all the flexures, the iliac, hepatic, splenic,
sigmoid, where the additional element of fecal arrest or impaction is
superadded to the cause of the disease.The catarrhal process occurs first in detached spots or streaks upon
the projecting folds or duplicatures of the mucous membrane; which
spots coalesce to form extensive surfaces.Examined by transmitted
light, these surfaces show a distinct arborescence of the vessels.Or
the disease may commence in the follicles in distinct areas of the
large intestine, and may remain confined to these structures to
constitute the variety known as follicular dysentery.The hyperaemia of inflammation is attended with dilatation and paresis
of the vessel-walls and retardation of the circulation.The whole
process may be arrested at this stage, so that there escapes from the
vessels, at most, only serum to develop the oedema which, with the
defective nutrition from arrest of the circulation, gives rise to the
softening of the epithelial cells.These cells may be thus lifted from
their bed to constitute the process of desquamation, the fundamental
anatomical characteristic of acute dysentery, by which process the
submucous connective tissue is laid bare and the so-called catarrhal
ulcer results.Or the epithelium, but partially detached, may remain
upon the surface, "either raised in the shape of small vesicles which
contain clear serum, or it forms a grayish-white layer resembling the
mealy scurf of the epidermis--an appearance which probably induced
Linnaeus to term dysentery scabies intestinorum interna" (Rokitansky).Kelsch maintains that the inflammatory process in dysentery commences
in the delicate connective tissue between the follicles, the network of
small spindle-shaped cells with multiple nuclei becoming speedily
penetrated by a number of very small, newly-formed vessels.Where the
epithelium is desquamated the surface is covered with granulations as
after a wound.The disposition of the follicles is soon deranged, for,
instead of standing in rows like gun-barrels, they are pushed asunder
and uplifted, so as to remain at different heights.Their interior
becomes blocked with mucus or their orifices occluded, so that
retention-cysts are formed to give rise to the appearance of the bead
necklace.Soon the walls of neighboring follicles coalesce, dissolve
away, and communication is established between them.The interior of
these communicating tubes or canals is filled with vitreous mucus; the
walls are stripped of their lining cells, but their "blind extremities
contain still adherent colossal epithelial cells."Moreover, the
follicles break into each other under the proliferative budding
process, so that the end of a distorted tube may be found in the
interior of another.Where follicles are destroyed the mucous membrane
above them or in their vicinity collapses--a condition observed and
described by Colin as effrondement.The mucosa in these regions may
appear perfectly uninjured, but by "blowing upon it with a tube it is
lifted up like an ampulla to show an opening in its centre," though
more frequently the mucous membrane collapses or sinks in at the region
of destruction.The inner surface of the mucosa is rendered
additionally uneven by the elevations or protuberances caused by the
{799} proliferations in the submucous connective tissue.The older
writers (Pringle, Hewson) regarded these projections as tumors of the
mucosa, and Rokitansky, who describes their true nature, speaks of them
as warty, tubercular (nodular) swellings or fungoid
excrescences--constituting a condition, he says, which Gely has termed
hypertrophie mamelonne.The alternate elevations and depressions thus
produced have been likened to the representations of bird's-eye views
of mountain-chains.As a rule, occasional red blood-corpuscles are also permitted to escape
through the vessel walls in the process of diapedesis to give to the
surface mucus its characteristic tinge, and punctate submucous
hemorrhage is very frequently seen.The pressure of the swollen, softened mucosa upon the sensitive nerves,
and the irritation of the acrid intestinal contents, are often invoked
to account for the constant desire of defecation (tenesmus) which
constitutes such an essential symptom of the disease; but both the
tenesmus and the colicky pains (tormina) precede the anatomical
changes, and are much more rationally explained by the direct action
upon the nerves of the cause of the disease, or by the derangement of
innervation effected through changes in the circulation.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery may exhibit no further lesions,
and in the lightest cases even these may have entirely disappeared
post-mortem, so that no change at all may be observed at the autopsy.In a more severe or protracted case the other alterations which
constitute the more complete cycle of the inflammatory process follow
the stage of hyperaemia.The arrest of circulation becomes more or less
complete, and the white corpuscles emigrate from the vessels to form
the pus-cells.Fibrin, or the elements which compose it, also escapes
to infiltrate the mucous membrane and remain upon its surface.The
pseudo-membranous or diphtheritic process is now developed, and may
vary in intensity from a mere frosting of the surface to dense
infiltration of the entire thickness.The false membrane, as well as
the mucous membrane, next suffers necrosis to form more or less
extensive sloughs.These sloughs are grayish-white when fresh,
dark-brown when stained by the intestinal contents, or greenish or
black when undergoing gangrene.They may cover patches of the mucosa or
the whole mucosa from the ileo-caecal valve to the rectum.They soon
become soft and pultaceous, hang in flaps or festoons in the interior
of the intestinal tube, or, detached, are voided in fragments or
shreds.One such fragment nine inches long is recorded in Woodward's
exhaustive description of the pathology of this disease.Examined under
the microscope, they are seen to consist of coagulated fibrin, red and
white blood-corpuscles, epithelial cells and debris, necrotic pieces of
mucosa, and myriads of micrococci and other micro-organisms.The fall of the sloughs leaves the dysenteric ulcer.Its edges are
irregular and ragged, its base uneven like a crater, and its surface is
more or less covered with pultaceous debris.The submucous connective
tissue may form its base, or, this structure having been also
destroyed, the muscularis may be exposed, or in more extensive
necrobiosis the peritoneum itself may be laid bare.Occasionally this
last barrier is broken down, and perforation occurs.Or an acute
peritonitis may be developed, in dysentery as in typhoid fever, by
simple extension of the inflammatory {800} process without perforation.Perforation is very rare in cases of follicular ulceration, and is by
no means frequent in the diphtheritic process, but it is the most
frequent cause of peritonitis in chronic dysentery.It may occur in any
part of the colon, but does occur most frequently in the caecum.The
resulting peritonitis is fatal as a rule, but the danger is obviated
sometimes, as in typhoid fever, by agglutination of the gut to a
contiguous structure or viscus.Perforation usually occurs late in the
disease, but it may occur very early.Thus Nagele reports from the
Franco-Prussian War a case in which perforation took place on the
fourth day, the diagnosis having been confirmed by an autopsy.In rare
cases a perityphlitis may ensue, with its natural consequences, or
periproctitis may be developed with perineal abscess, or, finally,
fistulae may form to burrow about and discharge themselves anywhere in
or upon the surface of the abdomen, the lumbar region, or the thigh.Bamberger describes cases of perityphlitis attending dysentery, in some
of which resorption occurred, while in others pus was discharged upon
the surface of the abdomen; and the writer of this article once saw, in
consultation with T. A. Reamy, a case of fistula which extended from
the descending colon to the vagina.Through the opening made to
discharge the pus from a fluctuating abscess pointing in the vaginal
vault an india-rubber tube could be passed for six to eight inches.The
patient finally died from marasmus.Chronic dysentery is distinguished by the alterations which occur in
inflammation developing more gradually and extending over a longer
period of time.Under the irritative changes resulting from an altered
circulation the connective tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, so that
the wall of the intestine becomes at times enormously thickened, and
its calibre is often correspondingly diminished.Cornil observes that
acute or subacute dysentery is characterized by infiltration of the
submucous connective tissue, followed by destruction, while in chronic
dysentery the predominant lesion is essentially a proliferation and
thickening of the connective tissue of the large intestine.The
muscular tissue also undergoes hypertrophy, and the peritoneum becomes
thickened and opaque.Sometimes the peritoneum is covered with patches
of false membrane, or agglutination occurs with other portions of the
intestine to give rise to contortions or occlusions.Ulceration shows itself in chronic dysentery in every grade and stage
of the process, from the first denudations to old cicatrizations.In
bad cases the whole course of the colon from the ileo-caecal valve to
the rectum may constitute one vast tract of suppuration.Blood-vessels
may be opened by the necrotic process, and copious, even fatal,
hemorrhage may ensue.When pure blood is discharged, the hemorrhage
usually occurs in this way per rhexem, but the quantities of blood
evacuated with other elements usually escape per diapedesem.The cicatrization which results puckers the edges of the ulcers, and
may in cases of extensive or circular ulceration lead to more or less
stenosis of the intestinal tube.According to Rindfleisch, the scars of
dysenteric ulcers are very prone to contract, so that "the liability of
a subsequent stricture is directly proportionate to the extent of the
previous ulceration."The danger in these cases may be immediate from
entire, or more remote from partial, occlusion.Thus, Bamberger records
a case of {801} typhlitis due to impaction of feces above a stenosis
gradually developed from a dysenteric ulcer.Although dysentery is a disease of the large intestine, its lesions are
not exclusively limited to this structure.It is always a purely local
disease at first, and, strictly speaking, continues so throughout its
course, yet it produces in severe or chronic cases widespread and
general effects.Rapid emaciation sets in, and anaemia is soon
pronounced in all the internal organs.The mesenteric glands show signs
of irritation or of absorption of specific products in hyperaemic
pigmentation and hyperplasia.The kidneys in acute cases exhibit venous
stasis, and in chronic cases may undergo parenchymatous change.The
joints are peculiarly liable to suffer in certain cases, and the
nervous system may exhibit lesions--points to be described in the
symptomatology of the disease.Should pyaemia occur, it superimposes
its own particular lesions in the serous membranes and internal organs.All of these affections are to be regarded, however, rather as
complications than essential effects.But the liver is found affected so frequently in dysentery as to
constitute more than a mere coincidence.Schneider has recently (1873)
reported of the results of his observations on 1400 cases of tropical
dysentery that in the 395 post-mortem examinations the liver was found
normal in but 10 cases.The abnormalities were as follows: hyperaemia
of various grades, 160; fatty degeneration, 62; abscess, 57; nutmeg
liver, 47; perihepatitis, 25; granular atrophy, 19; syphilitic atrophy,
8; cicatrices, 6; excavation with helminth, 1.Berenger-Feraud (1883)
reports of 411 fatal cases of dysentery observed at Senegal that the
liver appeared sound to the naked eye 98 times (23 per cent.)and
diseased "undeniably" 313 times (77 per cent.).Of the 313 cases of
hepatic affection there were found--hypertrophy, softening, or
hyperaemia, 123 times (39 per cent.); abscess, 143 times (46 per
cent.); simple discoloration, 29 times (9 per cent.); atrophy or
cirrhosis, 18 times (6 per cent.).Annesley found abscess of the liver
21 times in 29 cases of dysentery; Hospel, 13 times in 25 cases; and
Budd found ulceration of the large intestine 10 times in 17 cases of
hepatic abscess.Gluck had the opportunity of making 28 post-mortem
examinations in 151 cases of dysentery in Bucharest, finding abscess of
the liver 16 times.All these authors adopt the explanation first
offered by Budd of direct transfer of diseased products through the
mesenteric and portal veins.But more extensive observation has developed the fact that the
frequency of abscess of the liver in connection with dysentery is a
peculiarity of tropical climates.In the temperate and colder regions
of the North this complication is not by any means so frequent.Frerichs declares that of 16 observations collected by Louis and
Andral, "ulcers were present in only 3, and in 2 of these cases the
ulcers were tubercular; of his own 8 cases, there was intestinal
affection in none."Gluck believes that the liver is more prone to show
suppuration when already predisposed to it by a preceding amyloid or
cirrhotic change of malarial origin.Eichhorst calls attention to the
well-known fact that abscess of the liver is especially a disease of
the tropics independently of dysentery, and the frequency of its
occurrence here may be a mere coincidence.But it must be remembered
that opportunity for post-mortem examination, upon the {802} results of
which these statistics are based, does not occur in the great majority
of cases of dysentery, and abscess of the liver is very often
overlooked.Thus, Schneider cites cases where persons with abscess of
the liver of the size of the head were considered simulants up to
twenty-four hours before death.Since the diagnosis of hepatic abscess
has been made so easy by aspiration, cases begin to multiply; and it is
doubtless the experience of most practitioners, in the temperate zone
at least, that the decided majority of cases of hepatic abscess
acknowledge an existing or previous attack of dysentery.Certainly, few
authors would now venture to subscribe to the view of Annesley, that
the abscess of the liver was the primary malady and was the cause of
the dysentery.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Dysentery, as stated, begins, as a rule, with the
general signs of a gastro-intestinal catarrh.So frequent is this mode
of inception, and so few are the exceptions, that it is impossible to
resist the conclusion that the disease is caused by the introduction of
a noxious element into the alimentary canal.The irritation thus
induced begins at the stomach, and is rapidly propagated throughout the
whole tract of the intestine.In the course of a few days the cause of
the disease becomes strictly localized to the large intestine, whose
greater capacity and more sluggish movement fit it for the easier
reception and longer retention of noxious matter.But specific dysentery and the more intense forms of catarrhal
dysentery occasionally exhibit distinctive symptoms from the start, and
in rarer cases the disease is suddenly announced with such tempestuous
signs as to excite the suspicion of poisoning.Thus, a case (one of
five lighter cases) is reported from the Rudolfstiftung in Vienna
(1878) where the disease closely simulated Asiatic cholera, and where
it rapidly ran a fatal course, in spite of laudanum, soda-water, ice
pills, mustard plasters, injections of amyl nitrite, camphor, and
ether, and faradization of the phrenic nerve to stimulate the failing
respiration.Finger reports similar cases from the hospital at Prague.Ordinarily, the peculiar pains of dysentery first proclaim the
character of the disease.The severe grinding, twisting pains, tormina,
are more or less localized in the course of the colon, and hence
surround or traverse the entire abdomen, the pains at the epigastrium
being due to spasmodic contractions of the transverse colon.The
patient in vain adopts various postures in relief or sits with his
hands firmly compressing the abdominal walls.The tormina are more or
less intermittent or remittent, and are usually experienced in greatest
severity toward evening.During their acme the face wears the aspect of
the intense suffering, which is expressed in outcries and groans.At
the same time there is upon pressure over the whole abdomen more or
less tenderness, which soon comes to be especially localized at the
caecum or sigmoid flexure.The tenesmus (cupiditas egerendi) is a more distressing, and certainly
more distinctive, sign of dysentery.It is the feeling of heavy weight
or oppression, of the presence of a foreign body in the rectum, which
demands instant relief.At the same time intense heat is felt in the
rectum, which the patient likens sometimes to the passage of a red-hot
iron.The desire of evacuation becomes as frequent as urgent.In
well-marked cases the patient sits at stool half an hour or an hour at
a time, straining until faint {803} and exhausted, leaving the commode
with reluctance, only immediately or very soon to use it again.Great depression is felt at the stomach at the same time, with nausea,
occasionally with vomiting; and strangury, with the discharge of only a
few drops of scalding urine or blood from the bladder, adds additional
suffering to the disease.Retraction of the testicle and prolapsus ani,
especially in children, are prone to occur in severe cases.But neither the pain nor the prostration is so characteristic of
dysentery as the stools, which, though of very varied nature, are
nevertheless distinctive.After the discharge of the intestinal
contents the first evacuations consist of mucus in the form of glairy,
stringy matter, like the white of an egg, expressed as the result of
the violent efforts at straining.The mucus may be pure or tinged with
blood, but it is usually very scant in quantity, and stands in this
regard in marked contrast with the violence of the efforts to secure
its extrusion.It is the frequency of its discharge which constitutes
an especial distress.Twenty to forty, even two hundred, times in the
twenty-four hours the patient must go to stool.In the worst cases the
patient sits at stool or lies upon the bed-pan the most of the day.The mucus is sooner or later mingled with pus or stained with blood.The presence of pus by no means necessarily implies the existence of
ulceration, as the apparently pure mucus always shows occasional white
blood-corpuscles under the microscope, and even extensive suppurations
occur without apparent solutions of continuity.The presence of blood is equally characteristic of dysenteric stools.Usually it is intimately commingled with the mucus or pus or forms the
chief element of the copious so-called bilious discharge.The
evacuation of pure blood indicates erosion of vessels low in the colon,
often in the rectum itself, though enormous quantities of blood are
sometimes voided from unbroken surfaces.Thus Lecard reports the case
of a soldier who "while sitting restless at stool lost one and a half
quarts of blood."The patient died on the fifth day of the disease, and
at the autopsy there was found "apoplectiform congestion from the
ileo-caecal valve to the anus, but no ulcers anywhere, nor any broken
vessels."Besides the mucus, pus, and blood, the dysenteric stools contain the
sloughs which have been torn off by violent peristalsis in cases of the
diphtheritic form.Usually they are separated in shreds and fragments,
but occasionally large sheets, even casts of a section of the colon,
are voided en masse.These were the cases considered by the older
authors to be detachments of the mucous membrane itself.As already
observed, these fragments consist for the most part of inspissated
mucus, pus, blood, and tissue-debris; but there is no doubt that in
some cases partially necrosed mucosa also enters into their
construction.One enormous tubular cast fourteen inches long, preserved
in our Army Medical Museum, was found to be "composed of
pseudo-membranous lymph in which no traces of the structure of the
mucous membrane could be detected" (Woodward).There still remains to be mentioned the boiled-sago or frogs'-spawn
matter whose origin has given rise to such a curious mistake.Not
infrequently these vitreous-looking bodies compose the bulk of the
sediment in the stools of dysentery, and even some of our modern
authors, {804} unacquainted with the more searching investigations of
Virchow, have regarded them as expressed contents of intestinal
follicles.Virchow found that under the application of iodine they
always assumed a blue color, whereupon he ironically remarks that the
sago-like mucus is really mucus-like sago.They are simply granules of
starch ingested as food, to remain partially or wholly undigested.The scybalae, the composite matter known as the lotura carnea, and the
micro-organisms found in the stools have already received mention
elsewhere.Although the stools of dysentery are scant, as a rule, they are so
frequent as to discharge during the entire twenty-four hours a very
large quantity of albuminous matter.Oesterlen has made the curious
calculation to show that the mean daily loss of albuminates in
dysentery of moderate intensity is from 50 to 60 grammes during the
first fourteen days, and on an average about 20 grammes during the next
eight days.The total loss experienced in an attack of three weeks'
duration thus amounts to about 1000 grammes--in rough figures, two
pounds avoirdupois.The rapidity with which emaciation, hydrops, and
marasmus occur in severe cases is thus easily accounted for.Nagele
speaks of cases where patients were reduced to skeletons in eight to
fourteen days, so that the convalescence extended over six weeks to
eight months.The alteration in the character of the secretion in dysentery is not
confined to the mucous membrane of the large intestine.On the
contrary, all the digestive juices are changed, in some cases entirely
checked.In the graver cases the saliva takes on an acid reaction and
loses its glycogenic properties; the gastric juice in the same cases
becomes alkaline and loses its peptonizing properties; while the
secretion of the bile is wholly arrested.Uffelmann, who had the rare
opportunity of studying the secretion of bile in a case of biliary
fistula, relates that during an attack of dysentery the bile ceased
entirely to flow, and only began to show itself again, at first
greenish, then greenish-brown, finally brown, during the process of
resolution on the ninth day of the disease.The anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting which so often mark the access or attend the course of
dysentery find thus easy explanation.Should the disease continue, the general strength of the patient
becomes so profoundly reduced as to resemble the status typhosus.The
tongue, which has been hitherto thickly coated, now becomes black,
shows fissures, and bleeds, while the gums are covered with sordes.The
pulse becomes feeble, thready, or barely perceptible.The skin is dry
and harsh or scaly.The abdomen is tumid or collapsed, the anus
paralyzed, and the discharges continuously ooze out to excoriate the
perineum.While the brain is usually clear throughout the disease,
insomnia, stupor, or coma develop in the gravest cases from absorption
of disease-products (Senator), or death suddenly ensues from heart-clot
or from thrombus of the venous sinuses of the dura mater (Busey).Pyaemia announces itself with a series of chills, followed by irregular
temperature, by the speedy occurrence of multiple abscesses in distant
organs, venous thromboses, affections of the serous membranes,
pleuritis, pericarditis, and embolic pneumonia.Gangrene of the
intestine, which may occur as early as the third day of the disease
(Nagele), is evidenced by the signs of general collapse.{805} COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELAE.--The lighter cases of dysentery, as
well as most of the grave cases, run their entire course without
complication, and often without sequelae.But a certain percentage of
cases is attended with complications on the part of the joints
(rheumatism), of the nervous system (paralysis), and on the part of the
liver and the kidneys.Arthritis, when it occurs, shows itself, as a rule, in the second week
of the disease (Eichhorst), or after the disease has run its course,
during the period of convalescence (Huelte).That it is not a mere
coincidence is evidenced by the fact that it is present in a large
number of cases in certain epidemics, while it is not present
independently of dysentery.Thus, Braun of Stannenheim saw in the two
epidemics of 1833-34 more than forty cases of rheumatism, and Huelte
reports ten cases observed by himself in the epidemic at Montargis in
1854.Certain epidemics are distinguished by the rarity of this
complication, while most are marked by its absence altogether.In the
epidemic at Rahden (1872), 400 cases among 3800 inhabitants, Rapmund
saw inflammation of the joints set in only six times; and the entire
absence or extreme rarity of it in later epidemics have led most
physicians to deny any connection between the diseases, or to regard
the joint affection as incident to a complicating scorbutus or
neuralgia.All authors who admit it describe the knee-joint as being
the most frequent seat of the affection, but acknowledge that it is
mostly polyarticular; while there is much difference of opinion whether
it ever presents the general signs of true rheumatism--pyrexia,
diaphoresis, or its complications on the part of the heart.Huelte
maintains that it does not, and that it is allied to gonorrhoeal
rheumatism in this respect, while Eichhorst states that it may not only
show all these signs, but may be followed in exceptional cases by
suppuration and ankylosis.It usually lasts four to six weeks, but
neither its occurrence nor its severity stands in any relation to the
intensity of the attack of dysentery.It is probably to be regarded as
a manifestation of a light pyaemia or septicaemia, as it is a frequent
manifestation of this condition in or after scarlatina, puerperal
fever, and the septic fevers of surgery.Paralysis has been observed to occur after dysentery ever since the
days of Galen, and, disregarding the observations of ancient and of the
older periods of modern times, we find occasional records of cases in
our own days.Leyden,[6] in reporting a case of paresis and rheumatic
pains following an attack of dysentery, says that although
post-dysenteric paralysis is now rarely mentioned, it was frequent in
the older reports, and claims it as an admitted fact that it occurs not
at all infrequently now.Joseph Frank quotes some observations of this
kind, and refers especially to the dissertation of Fabricius.[7] These
paralyses, Fabricius observes, have been seen after the premature
suppression of malignant epidemics of dysentery by opiates and
astringents.Observations were afterward recorded by Graves in which
paralysis occurred after colics and inflammation of the intestines; and
English veterinary surgeons mention the fact that paralytic weakness of
the posterior extremities of horses and cattle follow attacks of
intestinal inflammation.The paralysis, when it occurs, is usually
confined to the lower extremities, but may extend to {806} and involve
the upper extremities, by preference in the form of paralysis
transversa (opposite arm and leg).Brown-Sequard attributes it to
reflex contraction of the blood-vessels; Jaccoud, to exhaustion of the
nerve-centres; and Roser, to the contact of the inflamed transverse
colon with the solar plexus.Remak first suggested the idea of an
ascending neuritis--a view which would seem to be corroborated by the
paralysis observed after the experiments, by Lewisson, of crushing the
uterus, kidneys, bladder, or loop of intestine, and which finds
additional support, as Leyden remarks, in the length of time which
lapses before it appears.Landouzy[8] says that Finger found diffuse
myelitis in a patient affected with paralysis supervening upon cancer
of the intestine, and that Delioux and Savignac saw spots of softening
in the cervical and lumbar region of the cord in the case of a man
affected with post-dysenteric paralysis.Weir Mitchell suggests the
possibility of other factors--long marches, malaria, bad diet, and
injuries to the spine--in the genesis of the cases, mostly paraplegias,
observed by him; and Woodward calls attention to lead-poisoning (as by
treatment) in explanation of a certain number of cases.[Footnote 6: "On Reflex Paralysis," _Volkmann's Sammlungen_.][Footnote 7: _Paralysis seu hemiplegia transversa resolutionem brachii
unius et pedis alterius exhibet_, Helmstedt, 1750.][Footnote 8: _Des Paralysies dans les Maladies aigues_.]Abscess of the liver gives rise to few distinctive symptoms, and is
mostly recognized or suspected, in the absence of positive signs, by
the persistence or obstinacy of the dysentery.The ease and impunity
with which aspiration may be performed in its recognition justifies the
use of it in every doubtful case.Regarding complications on the part of the kidneys, Zimmerman
recognizes four classes of cases: (1) mild cases, showing no albumen
and no casts; (2) severe, long-continued cases, with putrid stools,
status nervosus, and collapse, showing albumen; (3) cases commencing
with nervous symptoms, paralysis, scanty urine, showing kidneys filled
with exudation-cells and detritus; and (4) cases of speedy renal
complication and death.To these may be added the cases of protracted
chronic dysentery with long-continued suppuration, entailing the
possibility, of really rare actual occurrence, of amyloid degeneration
and chronic parenchymatous change (Bartels).Dysentery may be further complicated by parotitis; by venous thrombosis
(phlegmasia dolens); by diphtheritic deposits on other mucous surfaces,
which Virchow declares to be exceedingly rare; and by hydrops, which is
oftener a concomitant of the period of convalescence.Besides the deformities of the colon, which may ensue as a consequence
of ulceration or peritonitis, a long attack of dysentery is apt to
leave a hyperaesthetic or non-resistant state of the mucous surface, so
that every imprudence in exposure or in diet begets an intestinal
catarrh or a relapse of the disease.DIAGNOSIS.--When dysentery presents itself with its whole train of
symptoms the recognition of the disease is very easy.The tormina and
tenesmus, the peculiar discharges, the rapid reduction of strength,
leave no doubt as to the nature of the affection.The prevalence of an
epidemic of the disease will often establish the character of a case
even when all the signs are not present or when anomalies occur.Embarrassment in diagnosis only attends the recognition of catarrhal or
isolated cases, and in these cases there may be a doubt as between
dysentery and {807} diarrhoea--if such a symptom can be called a
disease--or typhoid fever, cholera, or some purely local affection of
the rectum, cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.In children difficulty of
diagnosis may arise as between dysentery and intussusception.Dysentery is differentiated from that lighter form of intestinal
catarrh whose main symptom is diarrhoea by the presence of tenesmus in
dysentery, as well as by its mucous, muco-purulent, diphtheritic, and
bloody discharges.Dysentery lasts longer than diarrhoea as a rule, and
does not yield so readily to treatment.Typhoid fever shows from the start brain symptoms, which are absent
from dysentery; has a typical temperature-curve, whereas there may be
no fever in dysentery, or, if any, of irregular remittent type; is
often prefaced by epistaxis and attended with bronchitis, both of which
are absent in dysentery; and exhibits ochre- pea-soup stools,
altogether different from those of dysentery.Cholera morbus distinguishes itself from dysentery by its sudden onset,
its profuse vomiting and discharges, its violent cramps, and the speedy
collapse.Cancer of the rectum can be usually felt, and hemorrhoids can be always
seen, so that no difficulty should be experienced in the recognition of
these cases.Intussusception occurs mostly in children, and has, in common with
dysentery, vomiting, mucous or bloody stools, colic, tenesmus, nervous
unrest, and prostration, so that a differential diagnosis may be
impossible for a few days.The more strict localization of an
intussusception, which may sometimes be felt as a sausage-like mass,
most frequently in the right ileum and hypochondrium, the greater
frequency and persistency of the vomiting and pain, the presence
visibly or palpably of the invaginated gut at the anus or rectum, soon
enable the careful examiner to recognize the case.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of dysentery varies between extremes.Some
cases are so mild as to merit the remark of Sydenham concerning certain
cases of scarlet fever: "Vix nomen morbi merebantur."They terminate of
themselves under favorable hygiene without especial treatment.On the
other hand, no known disease has a more frightful mortality than
dysentery in some of its epidemics, especially in army-life.It was
this class of cases which Trousseau had in mind when he called
dysentery the most murderous of all diseases.Sixty to eighty may be
the appalling percentage of death in these cases.Under favorable surroundings the average mortality of dysentery amounts
to 5-10 per cent., but is much influenced by the age and the general
condition of the patient, as well as by the complications which occur
in its course.Thus, Sydenham said of it over two hundred years ago,
"It is not infrequently fatal to adults, and still more so to old men,
but is nevertheless exceedingly harmless to infants, who will bear it
for months together without suffering, provided only Nature be left to
herself."But dysentery is by no means always harmless to infants, for
in some epidemics this period of life has been visited with the
greatest severity.Thus, Pfeilstucker reports of Wurtemberg (1873-74)
that the greatest mortality, 39 per cent., occurred at the age of one
to seven years, and the least, 4 per cent., at the age of thirty-one to
fifty years; {808} and Oesterlen says of England that dysentery causes
20 per cent.of deaths from all causes in the first year of life.Nor does the prevalence of a greater number of cases necessarily imply
a heavier mortality.For Bianchi reports of Rome that cases of
dysentery constituted but 2.28 per cent.of all the admissions into the
Ospedale di San Spirito in 1873, while in 1874 the percentage increased
to 3.68; yet the mortality of 1873 was 17.02 per cent., while that of
1874 was but 9.09 per cent.Complications on the part of the nervous system, the status typhosus,
pyaemia, and great prostration, necessarily render the prognosis grave,
yet even these cases are not necessarily fatal.Thus, Jules Aron
reports from the epidemic at Joigny (1876) a case of recovery after
complete paralysis of the sphincter ani.The recognition and discharge
of an hepatic abscess relieves the patient from the dangers of this
complication.Peritonitis alarmingly aggravates the prognosis, and
perforation is almost of necessity fatal.PROPHYLAXIS.--The improved sanitation of modern times has already
diminished the frequency and mitigated the severity of epidemics of
dysentery; and this fact, which is only an accidental observation as it
were, gives the clue to the means of its further prevention.The selection of proper sites for camping-grounds, barracks, and
hospitals, the prevention of overcrowding in tenement-houses, ships,
and jails, the regulation of sewage, the care for the food and drink,
the observation of the strictest cleanliness by authoritative
control,--all these are general measures which suggest themselves in
the prophylaxis of this or any disease.In the management of individual cases the first precaution is to
prevent the dissemination of the disease.Whether it be really
contagious or not, every case should be managed, as Bamberger suggests,
as though it were contagious; and this protection of others secures for
the individual patient the most favorable hygiene.The bedding must be frequently changed; the windows kept open to secure
free ventilation, which, in the light of existing knowledge, is the
only true disinfectant; and all the furniture of the sick-room,
especially including the receptacles for the discharges, must be kept
perfectly clean.For this purpose the best purifier is very hot water.The temperature of the sick-chamber, if it be subject to regulation,
should never be allowed to sink below or rise above 65-70 degrees F.

The drinking-water should be secured, during an epidemic, from the
purest possible source, and if good drinking-water cannot be had, what
there is should be thoroughly boiled.The discharges should properly be mixed with sawdust or some
combustible substance and burned, or if this be impracticable should be
buried in the soil a few feet below the surface, and not emptied into
water-closets or privy-vaults used by others.Such articles of food should be abjured as have a tendency to produce
intestinal catarrh.So unripe fruits, vegetables which readily undergo
fermentation--in short, all indigestible substances--should stand under
ban.But no prohibition should be put upon ripe fruits or simple
nutritious food of any kind.Lastly, individuals should protect themselves from catching cold.The
{809} researches of Pasteur have disclosed the fact that certain germs
of disease will grow and multiply in the body of an animal whose
temperature is reduced, when they would not increase without it.TREATMENT.--The first requisite in the treatment of an individual case
is perfect rest.Patients with even the lighter forms of catarrhal
dysentery should observe the recumbent posture, and cases of more
serious illness should be put to bed.Rest in bed, an exclusive diet of
milk--which should always have been boiled--and the time of a few days
is sufficient treatment for the mildest cases.Where there is objection
to milk, meat-soups, with or without farinaceous matters, rice, barley,
etc., may take its place.A case which is somewhat more severe will require perhaps a light
saline laxative--a Seidlitz powder, a dose of Rochelle salts or Epsom
salts in broken doses--or a tablespoonful of castor oil or five to ten
grains of calomel, to effect a cure.For the relief of the pain of the
lighter cases nothing is equal to tincture of opium, of which five to
ten drops every three or four hours in a tablespoonful of camphor-water
acidulated with a few drops of nitric acid will generally suffice; or
Dover's powder in broken doses, one to three grains, with five to
fifteen grains of bismuth or soda, or both, is a good substitute for a
change.The successful treatment of dysentery in any form depends upon a
recognition of the fact that the disease is local as to its seat, and
is probably specific as to its cause.The anodynes relieve the effects,
but the laxatives remove the cause.Consequently, the most rational
treatment of the severer cases is the irrigation of the large intestine
and the thorough flushing out of its contents.The use of clysters in
the treatment of dysentery dates from the most ancient times, with the
object, however, rather of medicating than washing out the bowel.O'Beirne (1834) and Hare (1849) were the authors of the irrigation
treatment, which they executed by means of a long tube introduced into
and beyond the sigmoid flexure.Since Hegar has recently shown how the
whole tract of the large intestine can be thoroughly inundated and
flushed with a common funnel and rectal tube, the practice has
continually gained ground, until it is now admitted as the most
valuable method of treatment.H. C. Wood of Philadelphia, and later
Stephen Mackenzie of London, have reported a number of cases in which
irrigation of the bowel with large injections medicated with nitrate of
silver, drachm j-pint j, was attended with the most surprising
results--sometimes but a single injection effecting a cure; and the
writer of this article has reported one case almost in articulo mortis
where complete cure followed the irrigation of the bowel--on three
occasions with three pints of water containing three drachms of common
alum.This case was all the more instructive from the fact that a
relapse had occurred after very striking but only temporary relief had
been obtained with the nitrate of silver, the alum having been
substituted simply on the ground of expense.Salicylic acid has also been extensively employed in this way with the
best effects, but carbolic acid has been discarded since the reports of
several cases of poisoning have been published.Should it become a
question of the necessity of a parasiticide, the bichloride of mercury
in extremely dilute solution, 1 to 1000, would be the agent par
excellence; but it is probable that the simple flushing of the bowel is
the chief {810} curative agent.The use of alum is not attended with
the dangers which have ensued from the absorption of carbolic acid, and
which might ensue from the bichloride of mercury.The water used in the
injections should always be cold.Ice-water injections alone give at
times the greatest relief.Wenzel uses injections of ice-water in all
recent and acute cases, whether slight or severe--in bad cases every
two hours.The object is to
introduce as much water as possible without producing too much pain.The large intestine of an adult holds, on an average, six imperial
pints, but in the author's experience not more than three or four pints
can be safely introduced.The patient should lie upon the back or the
left side with the hips elevated and the head low, while the injection
is slowly introduced from a funnel, fountain, or a bulb syringe whose
nozzle is thoroughly anointed with vaseline.In the absence of a
thoroughly competent assistant the operation should be performed by the
physician himself, for the proper use of an irrigating enema is a
practice which requires both judgment and skill.When pain is
experienced, the further influx of the fluid should cease for a few
minutes, when it may be resumed again and again until the largest
possible quantity is introduced.It is impossible to over-estimate the
value of this treatment in cleansing, disinfecting, and constringing
the foul and flabby surface of the whole seat of the disease.As was
said by Hare, "It changes a huge internal into an external abscess, and
enables us to cleanse the bowel of its putrid contents."Of all the remedies which have been recommended in the relief of
dysentery besides the irrigation method, but one, ipecacuanha, deserves
the name of a specific.This remedy was first introduced into practice
in 1648 by the botanist Piso, who was led to adopt it from the popular
praise he had heard of it while travelling in Brazil.He considered it
the most exquisite gift of nature, and administered it in infusion
according to the Brazilian (subsequently known as the French) method.Legros made three successive voyages to South America to import
supplies of the drug to France, but neither he nor the French merchant
Grenier, who had brought over more than one hundred and fifty pounds of
it, could secure its general use.Thereupon, Grenier acquainted Adrian
Helvetius, a Dutch physician practising in Paris at the time, with the
wonderful virtues of the Radix dysenterica, who, having experimented
with it first upon patients of the lower classes, was later successful
in curing the Dauphin of France.The further use of it, by permission
of the king, at the Hotel Dieu, enabled him to secure a monopoly of its
sale and secured for him a grant of a thousand pounds.Grenier hereupon
put in his claim for a division of the profits, and upon the refusal of
Helvetius instituted suit to obtain his rights.Justly indignant at the
loss of his suit, he revealed the secret, and ipecacuanha became common
property at once.Extravagant ideas were now entertained of its value,
but in the extreme reaction which followed every virtue of it was
disavowed, so that the drug came to be almost forgotten.From this
temporary oblivion the remedy was rescued by an English army surgeon,
E. Scott Docker, in 1858, who administered it, in combination with
laudanum, in his regiment, on the island of Mauritius, in all cases and
stages of the disease with such success that out of fifty cases he lost
but one.Although such indiscriminate use and such almost unvaried
success has not attended, and from the nature {811} of different cases
could not attend, its universal employment, there is no doubt of the
inestimable value of the service rendered in the restoration of the
remedy in the treatment of dysentery.Yet over twenty years elapsed
before its author received from his country, at the urgent solicitation
of the Director-General, in recognition of this service, a grant of
four hundred pounds.Remarkable testimony as to its efficiency soon began to appear.Ewart[9] recommends ipecacuanha in every form and type of acute
dysentery, as well as in the acute attacks supervening upon chronic
cases.Its advantages are simplicity, safety, comparative certainty,
promptitude of action, decrease of chronic cases and of complications,
especially abscess of the liver, and great reduction of mortality."It
produces all the benefits that have been ascribed to bloodletting,
without robbing the system of one drop of blood; all the advantages of
mercurial and other purgatives, without their irritating action; all
the good results of antimony and other sudorifics, without their
uncertainty; all the benefits ascribed to opium, without irritating, if
not aggravating or masking, the disease."To the objections urged
against it he replies that the nausea is only temporary and
evanescent--that vomiting is exceptional and of but short duration;
moreover, it permits nourishment and assimilation and produces sleep.If uncontrollable sickness and vomiting occur, they are probably due to
abscess of the liver, malaria, some other cachexia, Bright's disease,
strumous mesenteric glands, hypertrophy of the spleen, peritonitis, or
extensive sloughing.[Footnote 9: _Indian Annals Med.Cunningham prefaces the treatment by a sinapism to the epigastrium and
half a drachm of the tincture of opium.Then from one to one and a half
drachms of ipecacuanha are administered in powder.It causes
considerable nausea, and vomiting occurs in one to two hours.During
the nausea copious perspiration breaks out, the pulse becomes fuller,
softer, and less frequent, the tenesmus and abdominal pains cease, and
the patient has no more stools for twelve to twenty-four hours.The
next evacuation is easy, fluid, but free from blood or mucus.Sometimes
the dose of ipecacuanha may require to be repeated.Malun reports the results of treatment of 436 cases occurring in
twenty-one months.There were only 6 deaths, and in only 1 of these
could the remedy be fairly said to have failed.Under all other plans
of treatment the mortality has varied from 12 to 22.3 per cent.Docker says that the mortality of dysentery in the British army
during the ten years that followed the adoption of the ipecacuanha
treatment fell from 11 to 5 per cent.The remedy is best administered in large doses, 20 to 40 grains, and
should be repeated every four to twelve hours until permanent good
effects are secured.A dose of 15 to 30 drops of tincture of opium, or
morphia, one-fourth grain hypodermically, will best protect the patient
from too great exhaustion.The beneficial results are mostly obtained
in the acute cases, though surprising results sometimes follow in cases
of very long standing.Thus, Gayton records a case of severe chronic
dysentery of eighteen months' duration which was entirely cured by
ipecacuanha, and probably most physicians of large practice can recall
cases where the continual relapses of the dysenteric habit have been
completely broken up by {812} one course of active treatment.Should
the remedy fail to be of service in the course of forty-eight hours, it
should be discontinued.Batiator, the bark of the root of the Ailanthus glandulosa; mudar, the
bark of the root of the Calotropis gigantea; and bael-fruit, more
especially in chronic cases,--have been proposed by Roberts, Duval,
Chuckerbutty, and others as substitutes for ipecacuanha, but are not
likely to soon supplant it.Materia medica is rich in drugs whose virtues have been vaunted in
dysentery, and cases occur where the judicious physician will make his
selection according to the indications in a given case.Turpentine
internally, as well as externally in the form of a stupe (Copland), has
had advocates from ancient times; astringents, tannic acid or the
substances which contain it, kino, catechu, krameria; the acetate of
lead, nitrate of silver, etc.; antiseptics, carbolic acid, salicylic
acid, boracic acid; anodynes, opium and its preparations; and
quinia,--are among the agents most frequently employed.Bonjean (1870) had occasion to laud the efficacy of ergotin in checking
hemorrhage and controlling the discharges in a report which
substantiates the claim of Rilliet and Lombard in the epidemic at
Geneva in 1853.Massolez had the same good results in the war of the
Crimea, as had also Andrea in the Spanish hospitals of Ceuta and
Tetuan.Clysters of nitrate of silver, 4 grains to 5 ounces of water (Duchs),
or with a few drops of tincture of opium (Berger); of ipecacuanha
(Begbie and Duckworth); of laudanum and starch (Sydenham, Abercrombie);
of the various astringents,--may be tried in obstinate, more especially
chronic, cases.Local inspection of the rectum by means of the speculum may possibly
reveal an ulcer, which is the chief or sole cause of the tenesmus and
bloody discharge.Maury reports such a case in which the ulcer was deep
enough to hide a small sponge.In such cases topical treatment may
effect a cure.Dilatation may suffice to overcome a stricture in the rectum, the
result of cicatricial contraction, or colotomy may be necessary in
cases more refractory or situated higher in the bowel.Post[10]
reported a successful colotomy, with the formation of an artificial
anus in the left lumbar region, in such a case.The food should be fluid, but nutritious, and milk best fulfils both
these requisites.Where milk cannot be tolerated it may be substituted
by soups, beef-tea, mutton-broths, chicken-soup, etc.But it should be
known of these substitutes that they contain little or no nutritious
matter on account of the insolubility of the albuminoids, and are
really only stimulants.Soft-boiled egg, thin custards, sweetbreads,
scraped or chopped raw beef--albumen thus in substance--constitute the
best food.But during the intensity of an attack the patient should
almost altogether abstain from food, both from lack of inclination for
it and from lack of ability to digest it.During convalescence the food
should be on the basis of animal diet, though ripe fruits and fresh
succulent vegetables should not be altogether withheld.In all cases of pronounced prostration stimulants are to be freely
used, and of all stimulants alcohol is the best, as it has also
nutritive and {813} antiseptic properties.Alcohol is thus triply
indicated in the treatment of dysentery, but the choice of the form and
strength will be a matter of judgment in the individual case.Where life is imperilled by hemorrhage or anaemia from any cause, a
forlorn hope is offered in transfusion, which in the hands of C.
Schmidt (1874) has proved successful in two cases.Abscess of the liver is best treated by aspiration or hepatotomy;
rheumatism, by the salicylates; and paralysis, by the constant current
of electricity.Obstinate cases of chronic or continually recurring dysentery are
thoroughly cured only by a sea-voyage, a sojourn at the seashore, a
mountain-excursion, or a permanent change of climate.{814}

TYPHLITIS, PERITYPHLITIS, PARATYPHLITIS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.HISTORY.--Typhlitis ([Greek: typhlos], blind), inflammation of or about
the head of the colon, more especially the vermiform process, is a
disease of modern recognition.Individual cases had been reported as
curiosities where foreign bodies or fecal accumulations had excited
inflammation in this part of the intestine, but it is undoubtedly to
Dupuytren[1] that the credit is due of having first individualized this
disease as a separate affection.About the same time (1827) Longer
Villermay published his communications in the _Archives gen._, t. v.246, on the diseases of the vermiform process, to be followed in the
same year by Melier[2] and Hussar and Dance with observations on
inflammation of the connective tissue in the region of the caecum.These affections, which had been hitherto described as inflammatory
tumors in the right iliac region, now received from Puchelt[3] the
distinct name perityphlitis.[Footnote 1: _Lecons oral de Cliniq.[Footnote 2: _Arch, gen._, Sept., 1827.][Footnote 3: _Heidelberg klin.Perhaps the most remarkable events in the history of these affections
since this time are the contributions of Stokes and Petrequin (1837) on
the value of opium in the treatment of perforation of the vermiform
appendix, of Albers,[4] who first distinguished the special form of
typhlitis stercoralis, and of Oppolzer (1858-64), who set apart,
perhaps as an unnecessary refinement in differential diagnosis, a
paratyphlitis, an inflammation of the post-caecal connective tissue.Matterstock[5] (1880) deserves especial mention for having given such
prominence to anomalies of the vermiform appendix in the etiology of
the affection; and Kraussold[6] (1881) has connected his name with the
therapy of the disease by the boldness with which he expresses his
convictions regarding the necessity of early evacuation, by incision,
of inflammatory products, as first practised by Willard Parker in 1843.aus dem Gebiete der Pathologie_, ii.[Footnote 5: _Handbuch d. Kinderkrank._, Bd.[Footnote 6: _Volkmann's Sammlung._, No.GENERAL REMARKS.--Typhlitis, strictly speaking, is limited to
affections of the caecum and its appendix vermiformis; perityphlitis is
mostly due to extension of the inflammation to the peritoneal envelope
of these organs; while paratyphlitis signifies an involvement of the
extra-peritoneal and post-caecal connective tissues.Both perityphlitis
and paratyphlitis are therefore secondary processes, though they may,
in exceptional cases, arise from affections of organs other than the
caecum, as from {815} perinephritis, psoitis, vertebral caries, or as
an expression of metastatic processes in pyaemia, septicaemia
(puerperal fever), typhoid fever, etc.ETIOLOGY.--Typhlitis and its allied affections or complications show
especial predilection for the male sex and the period of adolescence.Nearly three-fourths (733) of the whole number (1030) of cases of
perityphlitis collected from the literature by Matterstock were males,
and this proportion holds good in infancy and early youth as well as in
adolescence.The greatest number of cases, 33 per cent., occurred at
the ages of 21-30; next, 30 per cent., at 11-20; while the ratio
gradually decreases toward both extremes of life.So the opinion is
expressed with singular unanimity by all authors that these diseases
pre-eminently affect the bloom of life.The observation that typhlitis has so often been found to arise from
disease of the vermiform process has led to a closer study of its
anatomical relations, and developed the fact that this organ is subject
to great variation in size, shape, and situation.Normally, the appendix vermiformis arises from the posterior interior
aspect of the caecum as a tube of the diameter of a goosequill and a
length of three to six inches, with a general direction upward and
inward behind the caecum.It is commonly provided with a small
mesentery, which retains it in its place.Its cavity communicates with
the cavity of the caecum by a small orifice which is at times guarded
by a valvular fold of mucous membrane, while its free closed end
terminates abruptly in a blunt point.It is commonly found filled with
mucus throughout its entire length.The existence of this superfluous
structure, which is found only in man and certain of the higher apes,
has given rise to much speculation among the anatomists and
physiologists, especially of the teleological school, as to its
possible use.It is now, however, the generally acknowledged opinion
that the appendix vermiformis is a relic or rudiment of a subsidiary
stomach in lower forms of life.The head of the large intestine, which
forms almost an additional stomach in the Gramnivora, and is three
times the length of the whole body in the marsupial koala, is very much
reduced in the Carnivora, whose food contains but little indigestible
matter, and is greatly reduced in the Omnivora, as in man.The
vermiform appendix is the shrivelled remnant of the great caecal
receptaculum of the lower animals.In the orang it is still a long
convoluted tube, but in man it is reduced, as stated, to the size of a
quill three or four inches in length, and is often entirely absent.Kraussold, who complains that the vermiform process has hitherto
received only step-motherly treatment at the hands of anatomists and
clinicians, undertook a series of investigations which went to show how
often and what extreme anomalies do occur.In some cases the appendix
was disposed in an exactly opposite to the normal direction, its blind
end being turned upward along the ascending colon.In one case it was
found wound about the ileum; in another, spirally turned at its end and
lightly adherent to a hernial sac.Sometimes it was abnormally long or
short, open or closed with a valve, cylindrical, saccular, or bulbed,
fixed or free, curved or bent upon itself at a sharp angle, provided
with a short mesentery, and sometimes, as stated, it was entirely
absent.But by far the most interesting point connected with this organ was the
frequency with which it was found the seat of ulceration or stricture
{816} from cicatrization somewhere in its course, the result of
dysentery, typhoid fever, syphilis, and more especially of
tuberculosis.Clinicians who have been struck with the frequency with
which typhlitis has occurred in tuberculous subjects find in this
discovery a satisfactory explanation of this very remarkable
coincidence.Normally, the vermiform appendix is found filled, as stated, with a
tough vitreous mucus, but not infrequently masses of feces, foreign
bodies, intestinal worms, etc.find their way into it, where they may
remain innocuous or may excite a dangerous inflammation.This fact, in
connection with the general uselessness or superfluousness of this
structure, has led pathologists to characterize the vermiform process
with the significant appellation of a death-trap.Two anatomical factors deserve especial emphasis in explanation of the
frequent origin of disease in the vermiform appendix.One is the
existence of the valvular fold of mucous membrane, already mentioned,
at or near the orifice of the tube in the caecum, the clinical
importance of which was first pointed out by Gerlach.This fold is most
marked between the ages of three and twelve, and when pronounced
narrows the orifice to one-half or one-third of the whole calibre of
the tube.As a rule, this fold, and the consequent diminution in the
size of the orifice, are but little marked in the first years of life
and in old age, which accounts for the relative infrequency of
typhlitis at these periods of life.The second mechanical factor is the deformity caused by the abnormal
anatomical position of the organ, either as a congenital defect or as a
pathological change.Matterstock quotes from Zungel, who observed in 59
cases in the Hamburg hospital whole or partial obliteration 30 times,
catarrh and old fecal concretions 43 times, abnormal adhesions 12
times, and tubercular ulceration (without perforation) 11 times.Toft
claims as the result of 300 personal investigations that every third
person between the ages of twenty and seventy showed the traces of
present or past inflammation, and that actual ulceration existed in 5
per cent.Kraussold declares that this
percentage is rather too low than too high, and adds that among his
patients--who were, it should be stated, mostly phthisical--it was
remarkable how extraordinarily often the whole vermiform appendix was
the seat of an encroaching ulcer.In a number of cases cicatrices or
cicatricial alterations were found where typhoid fever or dysentery had
existed in the previous history.Attention should at least be called to a last anatomical factor in
explanation of the frequency of ulceration and inflammation of this
structure, in that its walls are so sparsely endowed with muscular
tissue as to render it unable to empty itself of the virus or germs of
disease which enter it from the comparatively stagnant reservoir, the
caecum.Constipation is usually invoked as a cardinal factor in the genesis of
typhlitis (typhlitis stercoralis).Speck calls attention to the
frequency of the disease in East Siberia, where the food, mostly
vegetable, contains a large amount of indigestible residue.But that
this condition cannot sufficiently account for the disease in most
cases is proved by the fact that constipation is more frequent in
advanced life and among females, in whom typhlitis with its associate
lesions is more infrequent.For the same reason a sedentary mode of
life loses force as an argument in its production.Perhaps the most
efficient cause of the condition is a local {817} paresis of the
muscular tissue of the caecum produced by the irritation of intestinal
catarrh, of disease virus, of a fecal concretion or a foreign body--an
irritation which may induce first a spasmodic action, and subsequently,
as a result, a partial paralysis or a paresis.The same condition may
be brought about more directly by the presence of a centre of
irritation--viz.Accumulation and
impaction of feces must then necessarily ensue, and it is highly
probable that this accumulation occurs in this way as a result more
frequently than as a cause of the condition.For the symptoms of a
simple accumulation of feces (coprostasis) are never so severe, at
least at the start, as to mark the onset of a genuine typhlitis.Nor is
there anything in healthy feces to induce the signs of a severe
blood-poisoning which so commonly announces the advent or course of
typhlitis.Room is here open for the surmise that most cases of typhlitis pur et
simple are due to the presence in the caecum of the germs or virus of
disease taken with the food or drink, and traversing innocuously the
whole length of the alimentary tract, to finally bring up in this most
stagnant part of the intestinal canal.The role of pure mechanical causes cannot be ignored or underrated in
perityphlitis, understanding by this division processes which commence
in the vermiform appendix.For it is the rule to discover in the
vermiform appendix in these cases either fecal concretions or foreign
bodies.Haeckel and Buhl found concretions of meconium in a new-born
child, and fecal concretions, intestinal stones, are far more
frequently encountered than foreign bodies.In 146 accurately observed
adult cases recorded by Matterstock, fecal concretions were met with 63
times, foreign bodies 9 times, while in the other cases nothing could
be discovered; and in 49 cases among children, fecal concretions were
discovered 27 times, foreign bodies 3 times, and nothing abnormal in
the remaining cases.Not infrequently a small foreign body acts as a
centre of crystallization for feces which become superimposed in
successive layers.Hairs, as of the beard, sometimes officiate in this
way.Among other foreign bodies met with in fatal cases of perforation,
independently of feces, may be mentioned round-worms (Faber),
cherry-stones (Paterson), needles (Payne), fish-bones (Zungel),
gall-stones (Hallete), a mass of ascarides (Klebs), buttons (Gerhardt),
etc., etc.As already intimated, supposed foreign bodies are often
found on examination to be nothing else than intestinal concretions.As
to cherry-stones, which are so often accused of producing typhlitis,
Biermer and Bossard found it difficult or impossible to force them into
the vermiform process.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions revealed upon the post-mortem table show
for the most part the ordinary picture of perforative peritonitis,
which is by far the most frequent cause of death.The peritoneum in the
vicinity of the perforation is found hyperaemic, swollen, necrosed,
covered with flakes of soft fibrin, or partially agglutinated to
contiguous structures.The wall of the bowel is very much thickened by
catarrhal swelling of its mucosa, proliferation of its submucous tissue
in more chronic cases, oedema of all its coats, or suppurative
processes.Not infrequently the mucous tissue is the seat of extensive
ulceration which may involve other structures of the gut or form an
abscess, even as large as a man's head, in its immediate vicinity.The
abscess may remain strictly localized or {818} may wander to discharge
itself into the ileum, caecum, duodenum, and diaphragm (Bamberger) with
resultant empyema (Duddenhausen), colon (Prudhomme), bladder (Bossard),
in which case the fecal concretion became the nucleus for a vesical
stone; acetabulum (Aubry), inferior vena cava (Demaux), or peritoneal
cavity, the most frequent eventuality.Duddenhausen saw in one case a
pylephlebitis result, Von Buhl a pylephlebitis and metastatic liver
abscess, which condition, Matterstock says, is noted 11 times in 146
autopsies; and older writers speak of discharges into the pleural sac,
into the lungs, pericardium, uterus, vagina, etc.A curious case was
observed by Eichhorst in Frerichs' clinic, where pus found escape
through the umbilicus.So cases of burrowing sinuses with abscesses at
distant seats, as in the groin or lumbar region, fistulae with
continuous discharge, and other curiosities, may be found among the
records by the curious.In cases of more acute course the lesions are often found centred about
the vermiform appendix.The most various contortions, adhesions, or
erosions are observed in this structure.Occasionally a constriction
occludes the course of the tube, while the distal end is dilated into a
condition of hydrops.It may be found perforated in one or in several
places.The cicatrices or agglutinations of old attacks may be
encountered; it may be cut in two or three pieces (Matterstock), or
have been entirely absorbed.Kraussold records a case of this kind in a
colleague who died of typhlitis.Upon the post-mortem table no trace of
the vermiform appendix could be encountered except a dimple on the
mucous surface of the caecum, indicating the site of its former
orifice.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Typhlitis announces itself in two ways--suddenly and
insidiously.In adults the disease begins as a rule with violent signs;
in children there is often a prodromatous stage which may last for days
or for months before a positive diagnosis can be established.There are
in these cases anorexia and vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea,
colicky pains, mostly concentrated about the ileo-caecal region.There
are at this time a disinclination to stand or walk, a stooped posture
or gait, occasionally a light icterus, a feeling of formication or
paresis in the right leg, and lastly an increased resistance or a
palpable tumor in the right ileum.In the adult the disease is wont to begin with more tempestuous signs.Not infrequently it is ushered in with a well-marked chill, upon which
immediately supervenes a sharp pain at the affected region.A general
collapse of strength soon follows, with fever, thirst, a husky voice, a
coated tongue, vomiting, singultus, and an expression of anxiety.The
impression of serious illness becomes apparent at once.The case early
bears the aspect of a grave infectious disease.A constant, dull,
boring, gnawing, or lancinating pain in the right iliac region first
excites the suspicion of the physician as to the real nature of the
disease.In children the pain is sometimes felt first in the
epigastrium; in three cases mentioned by Buchner, Herzfelder, and
Traube it was first experienced in the left ileum.There may be at this
time no tumor, but there is increased resistance to pressure and
exquisite tenderness to touch in the neighborhood of the caecum.The
whole abdomen is more or less tender, and often tumid.If there should
be also gurgling from displacement of gas, doubt is excited as to the
possible existence of typhoid fever.{819} In the course of a few days the tumor takes shape.A typhlitis
stercoralis shows a distension of the whole ascending colon, a
sausage-shaped tumor, smooth or nodulated, along the entire right side
of the abdomen, with increased resistance also in the transverse colon.More frequently in typhlitis--and, as a rule, in peri- and
paratyphlitis--the tumor or tumefaction is more localized about the
head of the colon.Frequently the swelling is so great as to be visible
as a protrusion or bulging of the affected region.Percussion shows
dulness, tanquam femoris, in cases of pure typhlitis, whereas in peri-,
and more especially in paratyphlitis, there is tympanites on light and
dulness only on deep percussion.Palpation or palpatory auscultation
occasionally, though very rarely, reveals a peritoneal friction sound
(Gerhardt).The third cardinal symptom of the disease is the disturbance of
digestion, which, as stated, often precedes or attends the first
manifestation of the pain and the tumor.Anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting--which is in the last stage of the disease often substituted
by singultus--present themselves as occasional or constant signs of the
disease.Constipation remains as a rule throughout the whole course of
the disease with an obstinacy which sometimes excites apprehension of
an intestinal occlusion; or the constipation may alternate with
diarrhoea or dysenteric phenomena, more especially in the earlier
stages.The tongue is, as a rule, heavily coated, or in typhoid states
is dry, glazed, or fissured, and sordes covers the teeth and gums.Fever is not a necessary factor in typhlitis, but when present
distinguishes itself by its irregular range.The pulse is usually
accelerated, full, and hard; the skin is dry and harsh; the urine is
scanty and high-, and contains "almost without exception
unusually large quantities of indican" (Eichhorst).Perforation, when it occurs, is usually recognized at once by the signs
of more or less immediate collapse, which quickly results in death.The abdomen becomes suddenly distended, meteoric over its entire
surface, the normal hepatic dulness giving place to a tympanitic
resonance.Not infrequently perforation occurs as the result of an accident, as
after a push or blow upon the abdomen (Volz), heavy lifting
(Volperling), riding in a wagon (Marsh), after dancing (Cless), mere
turning of the body in bed (Langdon Downs), after emesis (Urban),
purgation (Stokes), enema (Melier), etc., etc.That the slightest
agitation may suffice at times to break down the last barrier of serous
tissue separating the intestinal and peritoneal cavity is shown in the
case recorded by With, where fatal perforative peritonitis occurred
after a fit of immoderate laughter.Paratyphlitis distinguishes itself from the other forms of the disease
by its more insidious character.There is also in paratyphlitis, as a
rule, less disturbance in the alimentary canal.The caecum in
paratyphlitis is mostly empty or is filled with gas, whose presence is
recognized by tympanitic resonance on lighter percussion.On the other
hand, paratyphlitis is characterized by the greater frequency of
pressure signs in the right lower extremity.If the subjacent iliac and
psoas muscles be implicated, the thigh is flexed upon the leg in
decubitus.Various paraesthesiae, formication, numbness, pain, and
veritable paresis are experienced in the right leg.Dysuria, retraction
of the testicle, and priapism may also occur in this form of the
disease.Or pressure upon the iliac vein {820} induces thrombosis, with
oedema, milk leg.The long-continued process of suppuration in
paratyphlitis leads also at times to hectic fever or pyaemia, with slow
marasmus.In all cases relapses are very frequent, as repeated occurrences of the
disease constitute the rule.Eichhorst records the case of a
court-officer who suffered five attacks of paratyphlitis in the short
space of one and a half years.DIAGNOSIS.--The recognition of the disease is mostly simple.The pain,
the tumor, and the disturbances of digestion sufficiently, and for the
most part sufficiently early, distinguish the affection.Simple impaction of feces is differentiated by the history of
constipation; by the feel of the hardened feces, which form an
elongated, nodulated, sausage-shaped tumor along the entire ascending
colon, and later in shifting along the transverse colon; by the
comparatively slight tenderness; and by the entire relief which follows
thorough irrigation of the bowel.Cancer may be eliminated by regard of the age of the patient, the slow
development and course of the symptoms, and the gradual manifestation
of its cachexia.Invagination is an affection for the most part of early childhood--is
marked by the sudden appearance of violent symptoms of disturbance of
digestion, vomiting, often stercoraceous, occlusion, diarrhoea, or
dysentery, with straining and discharges of blood.DURATION.--Typhlitis and its complications have no definite duration.A
case may terminate fatally in the course of a few days or may extend
itself over months, or with its effects over years or for life.The
disease is, as a rule, much shorter in childhood than in adult life.According to Matterstock, nearly one-half (44 per cent.)of children
succumb to the disease within the first three days.Wood records the
case of a girl aged ten who died in nine hours.The average duration of
cases of typhlitis without suppuration ranges from fourteen to
twenty-one days.The early evacuation of inflammatory products by
aspiration or incision may cut the disease short at any time, or
exacerbations and remissions may manifest themselves for months or
years--a condition especially liable to occur when burrowing sinuses or
fistulae develop, or when passive encapsulated abscesses are aroused
into activity by some accident or indiscretion on the part of the
patient.PROGNOSIS.--A case of typhlitis stercoralis has no gravity, and should
terminate or be terminated within twenty-four to forty-eight hours
after its recognition.Neglected or unrecognized cases, however, are
not infrequently fatal from the circumscribed or more especially
diffuse peritonitis which may ensue.Typhlitis independent of fecal impaction is always a grave affection,
requiring in every instance a very guarded prognosis.Every form of typhlitis is more fatal in childhood than in adult life,
and any case of the disease may present grave complications or assume a
dangerous form at any time.The greater danger of childhood lies in the
greater liability to peritonitis.Most subsequent writers confirm this
statement, first made by Willard Parker, who also remarked that
suppurative processes, abscess formation, is more common in the adult.The mortality of perityphlitis alone in childhood is 70 per cent., in
adult life 30 per {821} cent., so that the proportion of recoveries is
exactly the reverse of these figures at the different periods of life.The general adoption of the opium treatment has, however, rendered the
prognosis of typhlitis far more favorable--has, in fact, reduced the
mortality in adult life from 80 per cent., the appalling figures of the
older statistics (Volz), to 30 per cent., the ratio of modern times.The means of earlier detection and readier relief of accumulated pus
have also contributed much to reduce the mortality of typhlitis.In
1872, Bull of New York had to report of 67 cases of perityphlitic
abscess collected by him, mostly treated without operation, a mortality
of 47-1/2 per cent., while ten years later (1882) Noyes of Providence
was able to report of 100 cases treated by operation a mortality of
only 15 percent.[Footnote 7: "Contribution to the Clinical Study of Typhlitis, etc.,"
_Trans.The development of fistulae or wandering abscess, the occurrence of
pyaemia and peritonitis, necessarily aggravate the prognosis of a
simple case.Perforation is fatal of necessity, yet cases are not
wanting where recovery has occurred even after this gravest of all the
accidents of the disease.Thus, Patschkrowski reports, from Frerichs'
clinic, a case of recovery after perforation, and Pepper mentions the
results of an autopsy made upon an old man who died of vesical
hemorrhage, in whom he "found that there had, at some unknown previous
time, been perforation of the appendix."PROPHYLAXIS.--The prevention of typhlitis has reference more especially
to cases of habitual recurrence of the disease in adults, or to the
earliest, prodromatous, stage in childhood.The slightest manifestation
of pain in the right iliac region should be looked upon with suspicion
in these cases, and absolute rest enjoined at once.Since in childhood
perforation has occurred in insidious cases after so slight an
irritation as a laxative or an enema, or even after a bath, every
provocation of this kind should be avoided.Injunction is to be put
upon all solid food in all cases in the inception as well as throughout
the course of the affection, that the element of coprostasis be not
superadded to the irritation of the disease.Adults subject to frequent
recurrences or relapses will thus avoid also the development or
aggravation of an intestinal catarrh, which in other cases of trivial
import may become dangerous to them.Many cases of typhlitis are
doubtless aborted at the start by the observance of absolute rest and
abstinence from food or rigid diet at the start.TREATMENT.--Perhaps no disease requires such careful consideration of
its cause or form, inasmuch as the different varieties call for
entirely different treatment.A typhlitis stercoralis, for instance,
requires an exclusive evacuant treatment, whereas a peri- or
paratyphlitis demands a treatment that shall put the bowels at rest.The safest and most effective method of emptying the caecum of impacted
feces is by irrigation of the bowels by means of the funnel syringe
devised by Hegar.The patient is put in the knee, elbow, or chest
posture, and warm water--which is the best solvent for hardened
feces--is allowed to slowly inundate the whole tract of the colon,
after the manner and with the precautions already pointed out in the
article on dysentery.Feeble or reduced patients should be supported in
this posture until as much water as possible is slowly introduced.As a
rule, a single thorough irrigation will suffice, or one or several
additional operations may be required {822} to secure the desired
effect.At the same time, broken doses, twenty grains, of sulphate of
magnesia may be administered every hour or two, not so much for the
purpose of exciting additional peristalsis as of turning water into the
intestinal canal from above.The other varieties of the affection call for opium at the start, with
the double view of preventing the irregular, spasmodic, or tetanic
contraction of the muscular coat and of obviating the danger of
peritonitis.Opium is not contraindicated in these cases, even if the
element of fecal impaction be superadded, as all clinicians are
familiar with the fact that the bowels will move of themselves at times
even under its full narcotic effects.The remedy is best given in fluid form, as in the tincture, that the
dose may be graduated in its repetition to secure its full effect
without danger.When a quick action is required, morphia hypodermically
may be preferred; yet it is to be remembered that opium with all its
active principles is of more value in the relief of peritonitis than
morphia alone.A careful watch should be kept upon all patients treated
with large or frequently-repeated doses of opium, that its toxic
effects be avoided.Not infrequently symptoms of poisoning have
supervened after a sudden relief of pain, necessitating the use of
means to keep the patient awake for a number of hours.Hot embrocations, or poultices applied over large surfaces of the
abdomen, give great comfort to the patient, though the very opposite
treatment of an ice-bag, occasionally shifted or suspended, is more
agreeable in some cases in the inception of the disease.So soon as a distinct doughy sensation or a more marked fluctuation
indicates the development of pus, steps should be undertaken at once to
secure its evacuation.In cases of doubt it is best to make a tentative
exploration with the needle of the aspirator, a large-sized needle
being preferred on account of the liability of occlusion with
tissue-shreds or other debris.It is quite surprising how rapidly a
case clears up at times after the evacuation of even only a drachm or
two of oedematous fluid.More frequently, however, the aspiration must
be repeated until a quantity of pus is secured and the abscess
completely discharged.An abscess of more superficial situation, of larger size, or of
continuous formation is best relieved by free incision.As to the time
of the operation, the old rule, ubi pus ibi incisio, holds good here as
elsewhere.An early evacuation of the products of inflammation prevents
the supreme danger of perforative peritonitis or the formation of
burrowing sinuses, fistulae, amyloid degeneration, and marasmus.Indurated tumors are sometimes made to soften under the long-continued
use of cataplasms, and chronic thickenings of the walls of the
intestine are relieved by general tonics, mild laxatives, mineral
waters, and gentle frictions with iodine or mercurial ointments.Perforative peritonitis calls for opium in maximum doses as a means of
facilitating possible agglutinations or encapsulations, and a forlorn
hope is offered in an early laparotomy, which the bolder surgeons are
now undertaking in the equally desperate cases of perforation by gall-
or kidney-stones, etc.Under no circumstances should a patient affected with typhlitis leave
the bed until the last trace of inflammation has subsided, as in no
disease is there greater liability to recurrence or relapse.{823}

INTESTINAL ULCER.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.Intestinal ulcer, Ulcus intestinorum entero-helcosis ([Greek:
helchosis], ulcer), represents a solution of continuity in the wall of
the intestine, affecting first, as a rule, its mucous coat.Ulcer of
the intestine, like ulcer of the stomach, its occasional congener and
not infrequent associate, is the expression of an insult or injury
offered to the intestinal coat in its inner exposed surface, or of a
necrobiosis the result of a local occlusion in the general
blood-supply.Hence, ulcer of the intestine may be a purely local
disease, or be the local expression of a general, so-called
constitutional, disease.While in many cases the lines differentiating
these conditions may not be distinctly drawn, as many so-called
constitutional conditions (tuberculosis, typhoid fever, etc.)are
discovered to be--at first, at least--local processes, the toxic ulcer
(arsenic, mineral acids) may be taken as a type of the local process,
acting from within, and the syphilitic ulcer as the type of the general
process, acting from without.At the same time, it must be recognized
of syphilis that an ulcer may result from the dissolution or breaking
down of a gummatous mass anywhere in the course of the intestine, or
may be the effect of infection by extension into the rectum of
syphilitic processes about the genital organs, or, lastly, of direct
introduction of the disease in perverted intercourse (pederasty, coitus
heterotopicus).Ulcer of the intestine is occasionally, though comparatively very
rarely, observed also as the result of pressure from within or without.Such an ulcer is properly considered of traumatic or mechanical origin,
as it is induced as the direct effect of mechanical irritation or
arrest of blood-supply.Thus, dense masses of inspissated feces,
foreign bodies, indigestible residue of food, may fret the mucous
surface into a condition of hyperaemia, and, later, absolute
ulceration.Undue retention, as behind a cicatricial contraction, or an
occlusion from whatever cause at places where the intestinal tube
normally offers resistance (at the ileo-caecal valve, sigmoid flexure,
etc.), may lead to ulceration in the same way.Schonlein has called
attention to the paralytic condition of the intestinal muscularis in
age as a predisposing cause of mechanical intestinal ulcer; and Virchow
has noticed the same condition among the insane, whose intense
preoccupation leads to neglect of evacuation of the bowels.Certain
intestinal parasites, more especially ascarides, are admitted as
occasional causes of ulceration, and more superficial solutions of
continuity in the rectum have been noticed as the result of too
frequent or too careless use of enemata.{824} Curling was the first to call attention to the fact that
extensive burns of the skin are sometimes followed by ulceration of the
intestines.The ulcerative process is almost exclusively confined to
the duodenum.Various attempts have been made to explain the intestinal
ulcer consequent upon burning of the skin, but a satisfactory
explanation is lacking as yet.Leube suggests an inhibition in the
force of the circulation by reason of accumulation of waste products in
the blood, while Billroth believes the ulcer to be the result of an
embolic process.Whatever the cause, the frequency of its occurrence
makes it more than a mere coincidence.According to Meyer, it is
observed most frequently in women, and shows its first symptoms in
seven to fourteen days after the initial burn.Aside from toxic and traumatic causes, ulcer of the intestine occurs as
the result of dysentery, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis--diseases
mentioned in the order of frequency in the production of intestinal
ulcer.The ulcers of dysentery in the large intestine, and of typhoid
fever in the small intestine, assume such prominence in these
affections--having even been erroneously considered at one time as the
cause of these maladies--that their study belongs to the history of
these diseases.The ulcer of tuberculosis is rather an accident in the
course of this affection, and is now recognized as the occasional
result of direct infection by the ingestion of tuberculous flesh, or,
far more frequently, of the deglutition of tuberculous sputum.As a
rule, the tuberculous ulcer shows itself late in the course of
pulmonary phthisis, and is the cause of the obstinate and colliquative
diarrhoea which speedily exhausts the patient.Yet cases are
occasionally met in which numerous or extensive ulcers occur in the
intestinal canal early in the history of phthisis, before any serious
damage has been inflicted upon the lungs.The tuberculous ulcer
affects, and for the most part is confined to, the same structures
which form the seat of disease in typhoid fever--viz.the solitary and
agminated glands of the ileum.When the bacilli tuberculosis are
conveyed to the intestine by means of the lymph- and blood-supply
through the mesenteric vessels, the resulting ulcer takes the shape of
the vascular arrangement; that is, the long axis of the ulcer is at
right angles to the course of the tube.Thus, if sufficiently
extensive, the ulcer may be circular or form a girdle or ring entirely
around the tube.With the tubercular ulcer or ulcers are usually found
tubercular nodules or plaques in the serous coat, which are visible to
the naked eye as opacities or milky deposits beneath the peritoneal
coat.The glands of the mesentery may be at the same time so much
increased in size as to form visible or palpable tumors in the abdomen.The frequency with which tuberculosis affects the vermiform appendix
has already been noticed in detail in the etiology of perityphlitis.The ulcer of the intestine which is the result of a catarrhal process,
so called, belongs to the history of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery.The true intestinal ulcer, per se, which has its analogue in the
stomach as the gastric ulcer, ulcus rotundum, is due to the same cause
as in the stomach--viz.to arrest of circulation and erosion by the
gastric juice.It is a well-established fact in physiology that gastric
digestion is continued--is, indeed, mainly effected--in the small
intestine; hence it is not surprising to learn that an arrest of
circulation in the small intestine {825} is attended by the same
result.The fact that this so-called peptic ulcer is found almost
exclusively in the duodenum speaks most emphatically for this origin of
the disease.Arrest of the circulation in the intestinal wall may be
due to embolus, which, according to the observations of Nothnagel and
Parenski, is not infrequently found in the branches of the duodenal
artery; to infarction, the condition so commonly encountered in pyaemia
and septicaemia; or to thrombotic occlusion, as seen in amyloid
degeneration--a disease process which selects by preference the vessels
of the alimentary canal, along with those of the kidney and spleen.The duodenal resembles the gastric ulcer in form as well as origin.It
has the same appearance, in its recent stage at least, of having been
cut out with a punch, shows no inflammation, induration, or thickening
about its borders, and presents the same funnel-shape with terraced
walls, its apex below eccentrically situated, as a rule corresponding
to the situation of the artery.It is most frequently found in the
upper horizontal portion of the duodenum, but is occasionally, though
rarely, seen in the descending portion.In the further course of the
duodenum the gastric juice becomes gradually neutralized, so that
ulcers situated below the orifice of the gall-ducts are very great
exceptions.In Krauss' collection of 47 cases but 2 were found in the
lower sections of the duodenum.The intestinal like the gastric ulcer
is usually found single or alone, but occasionally two, three, or even
four ulcers are encountered.According to the tables of Morot, a single
ulcer is found in 81.8 per cent.of cases, two in 9.2 per cent., and
three and four in 4.5 per cent.Duodenal like gastric ulcers are attended with the liability to
hemorrhage and perforation in equal if not greater degree.There is
also the same tendency to implication of contiguous structures.Stich
records a case of perforation of the aorta; Eichenhorst mentions the
formation of abnormal communication with the gall-bladder; and
Frerichs, a thrombosis of the vena porta in consequence of duodenal
ulcer.Lastly, the process of cicatrization may be followed by the same
disasters as occur in pyloric ulcers in consequence of contraction and
constriction.Thus, the orifices of the pancreatic or choledochus ducts
may be narrowed or completely closed, or the whole lumen of the
duodenum obliterated, with consecutive dilatation of the stomach and
oesophagus, as in the case narrated by Biermer.A very nice question in
differential diagnosis as between pyloric carcinoma and pyloric or
duodenal ulcer is sometimes raised in this way.In the vast majority of
cases it is safe, even in the absence of a palpable tumor and without
regard to the age of the patient, to decide this question in favor of
carcinoma.Cases of complete occlusion constitute the rule in
carcinoma, and the very great exception in ulcer.It remains to be said that duodenal is much more rare than gastric
ulcer, in the ratio of 1 to 30, and that, unlike gastric ulcer, it
chiefly affects males.According to the statistics of Krauss, already
cited, the ratio of males to females is 9 to 1, and according to Trier
the ratio is 5 to 1.It occurs in greatest frequency between the ages
of thirty to forty, diminishing in frequency with advancing age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Ulcer of the intestines announces itself by symptoms
which are, as a rule, much more vague and indefinite than the same
process in the stomach.In a certain percentage of cases the symptoms
{826} may be entirely latent, and the cause of a sudden death be
revealed only on the post-mortem table.In less severe cases the entire
symptomatology of intestinal ulcer is grouped under the term dyspepsia,
no characteristic phenomena being manifest throughout the course of the
disease.On the other hand, a very small ulcer may give rise to the most
dangerous symptoms--hemorrhage and perforative peritonitis, which may
be even fatal in the course of a few days or hours.Among the symptoms that appear with prominence in the course of the
disease is pain.Although cases are abundantly on record marked by the
entire absence of pain, and although pain is by no means so universally
present as in gastric ulcer, it occurs in the great majority of cases
of ulcer of the intestine.The pain of intestinal ulcer distinguishes
itself from gastric ulcer by being more independent of the character of
the food or the time of taking it.For the most part, it occurs in
attacks of colic, which are characterized at times by their extreme
severity, long duration, and obstinacy to every means of relief.These
attacks occur in paroxysms with complete or only incomplete remissions,
and are ascribed, as in gastric ulcer, to the erosive action of the
gastric juice upon exposed nerve-fibres, the intervals of relief
corresponding to the periods of exhaustion of the nerve-centres.At the
same time, in exceptional cases, a long-continued localized tenderness
to pressure may indicate the seat of the disease.Palpation may elicit, besides tenderness, points or regions of
induration or intumescence.Such a condition is more especially
encountered in cases of tuberculous disease, the so-called scrofula of
the intestine or the tabes mesenterica of childhood.More localized
enlargements are occasionally to be felt in the vicinity of the
duodenal or other intestinal ulcer in consequence of circumscribed
peritonitis, with its resultant agglutinations and adhesions.In this
connection caution must be exercised not to confound masses of impacted
feces with tumefactions.The history of constipation or the
administration of a light laxative will generally suffice to remove
this source of error.Anorexia is a symptom of intestinal ulcer as a rule.The loss of
appetite may amount to a complete aversion to all food or only to the
more fatty articles of diet.A curious exception to this rule is not
infrequently seen in the unappeasable hunger of children the victims of
tuberculous ulceration.The contrast offered in the extreme emaciation
of these patients has been made the subject of frequent comment.With this loss or perversion of appetite and defective digestion of the
food, the general condition soon begins to fail.Though cases are
occasionally met in which a bien-etre has been maintained for years, or
a condition of obesity has been retained, these cases form the
exception in the history of intestinal ulcer.More or less emaciation
gradually develops as a rule, and a reduction of the general strength
that is out of all proportion in its degree to the loss of flesh.At
the same time the mental condition of the patient suffers a degradation
to the level of the sufferer with chronic dyspepsia.The disturbances of digestion which occur in intestinal ulcer present
many varieties in degree and kind.Some patients show none or but few
of the signs, while others run the gamut, so to speak, in the
semeiology of dyspepsia.Heartburn, eructations, pyrosis, borborygmi,
flatulence, gastralgias, pseudo-anginas, nausea, and vomiting, the
familiar {827} phenomena of gastric or intestinal catarrh, attend at
some time or other in the course of the disease most of the cases of
intestinal ulcer.The condition of the discharges demands notice in detail, more
especially as abnormalities in the evacuations belong among the few of
the more constant symptoms of the disease.Diarrhoea is the rule in intestinal ulcer.The discharges consist at
first of the undigested food and the digestive juices, which have been
hurried along the alimentary canal and prematurely evacuated on account
of the increase of peristalsis caused by the irritation in the upper
part of its tract.The arrest of the digestive process leads to early
decomposition of the ingested matters, and thus imparts to the
discharges an exceedingly offensive odor.While, in exceptional cases,
constipation may be present, or even obstipation of the bowels, the
discharges are usually so abundant as to constitute a diarrhoea, which
in some cases is so frequent or profuse as to become colliquative and
speedily exhaust the strength of the patient.An ulceration situated in the colon or rectum would furnish the
discharges characteristic of dysentery, already described in detail,
while the same process in the ileum would show the evacuations
characteristic of typhoid fever or tuberculosis.The most characteristic ingredient of the true duodenal ulcer is blood.As stated in the article on HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS, ulcer of the
intestine constitutes the most frequent source of this accident, which
is sometimes so grave as to destroy life in the course of a few days or
hours.The blood from an intestinal ulcer may be evacuated both by the
mouth and the anus, or may be retained in the alimentary canal and not
appear at all.Such cases constitute the condition known and described
under the heading of occult or concealed hemorrhage, which is
recognized by the rapid general collapse of the patient.When the blood
issues from a duodenal ulcer, it is intimately commingled with the
contents of the alimentary canal.The discharges in such cases are
usually black, tarry, and more or less fluid; whereas blood from the
colon or rectum still preserves its fresh red color and is discharged
separate from the feces or simply coats its exterior.Occasionally
cases are met where the blood coagulates in the interior of the
intestinal canal, to form a cast of its lumen or to accumulate in great
mass in the sigmoid flexure or rectum.In one case in the experience of
the author such an accumulation was the cause of a very severe
tenesmus, which was only relieved by the digital evacuation of large
masses of inspissated, coagulated blood.The presence of pus would indicate lesion of the colon, as typically
shown in dysentery, as suppuration, at least with any visible products,
does not occur in ulcer of the duodenum.DURATION.--Ulcer of the intestine has no definite duration.As in the
case of its prototype, gastric ulcer, it may speedily be covered with
cicatricial tissue and never appear again in the course of a long life.But such a course is as unusual as in gastric ulcer.Frequent
recurrence constitutes the rule in intestinal ulcer, or a partial
recovery with frequent relapses, as in the course of ulcer of the
stomach.So ulcer of the intestine is not infrequently a lifetime
malady, with exacerbations and remissions dependent largely upon the
prudence or imprudence of the patient with regard to diet.It need
hardly be stated that ulcer of the intestine {828} may terminate
fatally even in the course of a few days from hemorrhage, circumscribed
and later diffuse peritonitis, or may drag out a slow length of years,
to finally destroy the patient with the general symptoms of inanition,
hydrops, and marasmus.DIAGNOSIS.--From what has been already stated, it is seen that ulcer of
the intestine is often entirely overlooked or may be readily confounded
with other maladies of the digestive tract.Cases of traumatic or toxic
origin are generally readily recognized by the history of the patient,
and tuberculosis reveals itself by the youth of the individual, the
existence of the disease elsewhere, the gradual emaciation, the
premature senescence--in short, the general signs of the phthisical
habitus, the meteorism, and perhaps the presence of nodular
enlargements of the mesenteric glands.The most characteristic symptom of the peptic ulcer is, as has been
stated, hemorrhage.But hemorrhage is present in only the minority of
cases, is, as a rule, occasional and transitory, and is at all times
difficult of differentiation as to its source.Blood from a gastric
ulcer may also be voided per rectum as well as per os, and the blood
from a duodenal ulcer after regurgitation may be wholly discharged by
vomiting.The absence of vomiting and the presence--more especially the
persistence--of tarry evacuations from the bowels would speak for ulcer
of the intestine.Dilatation of the duodenum, a condition of ectasia,
closure of the bile-duct with consecutive jaundice, or the presence of
fatty stools from occlusion of the pancreatic duct (a sign not now
regarded of the same value as in the days of Bright), would also
declare in favor of ulcer in the duodenum.As between intestinal ulcer and catarrh or intestinal ulcer and
carcinoma, precisely the same rules would hold as in the case of the
stomach.A simple enteralgia would be recognized by its more frequent
occurrence among females or individuals of neurotic temperament; by its
connection with faults of diet, malaria, or exposure to cold; by the
absence of hemorrhage, diarrhoea, or peritonitis.PROGNOSIS.--Too much caution cannot be exercised in the prognosis of
ulcer of the intestine; for even in the cases which run a perfectly
mild course the gravest, even fatal, accidents are liable to occur.The
danger of perforation in cases of typhoid fever from a single or from
one of the few ulcers that may be present imparts one of the chief
elements of gravity to this disease; and the same catastrophe may occur
at any time in dysentery or tuberculosis.The duodenal ulcer may
likewise have a sudden gravity imparted to a mild case by a copious
hemorrhage or a peritonitis, and, even though the patient escape all
possible complications, to recover with the surface of the ulcer healed
so that the loss of substance is filled in with firm cicatricial
tissue, the danger of contraction or stenosis still remains.The ulcers
of dysentery in the colon and of syphilis in the rectum are especially
liable to be followed by deformities of this kind, while the
tuberculous ulcer in the ileum not infrequently results in a more or
less complete stenosis.The ulcer of typhoid fever in its cicatrization
almost never reduces the size of the intestinal canal.TREATMENT.--The most valuable therapeutic means of relieving the pain
and obviating the dangers of ulcer of the intestine consist in the
{829} regulation of the diet.The food should be light, easily
digestible, and during the acute stage of the disease as nearly fluid
in its consistency as may be.Milk would be the staple article of diet
in all cases were it not for the fact that in some cases constipation
attends its too exclusive use.The various soups, without solids,
broths, preparations of starch (sago, arrowroot, tapioca, etc.), may
sufficiently nourish the patient until the healing process shall have
commenced.Raw beef, chopped up and made into an emulsion, is perhaps
the most nutritious and least injurious of any kind of food.Bread,
potatoes and other vegetables should be ruled out altogether, because
of their liability to produce masses of feces whose inspissation may do
mechanical damage to ulcers in process of cicatrization.Where there is failure in the general strength early resort should be
had to alcohol, which may be administered in the form of red wine (in
preference to white, because of the tannin it contains), wine-whey, or,
in more serious prostration, of sherry wine, milk punch, egg-nog made
with good whiskey or brandy.In the worst cases, where all food irritates, feeding by the mouth may
be abandoned altogether for a time, and the strength of the patient
sustained by nutritive enemata of beef or pancreatic emulsion.The diarrhoea should be controlled rather than entirely checked, for
fear of the greater evil of constipation.A little bismuth with
bicarbonate of sodium or oxide of zinc may suffice for the milder
cases, while in the more aggravated cases resort must be had sooner or
later to opium.Constipation is best relieved by careful injections of warm water or by
the administration of the lighter laxatives--mineral waters, Seidlitz
powders, citrate of magnesia, castor oil, etc.Vomiting is combated by ice, soda-water, champagne, cherry-laurel
water, and in graver cases morphia hypodermically.Pain may be relieved by applications of hot water, cataplasms,
injections of hot water, and, when necessary, by morphia with or
without belladonna.Hemorrhage is checked by ice internally and externally, turpentine,
ergot or preferably ergotin by hypodermic injection, and opium.Peritonitis, more especially perforative peritonitis, calls
imperatively for the liberal use of opium.Patients the victims of intestinal ulcer must maintain a guarded diet
for months, often for years, after all signs of the disease have
disappeared as the best prophylaxis against recurrence.Constant
vigilance is also required to avoid constipation, and the greatest
temperance exercised with regard to the use of alcohol.The author has
at the present time a patient under treatment who presents all the
symptoms of duodenal ulcer, including hemorrhage, with every indulgence
in strong drink, and in whom all symptoms disappear under entire
abstention.Sometimes a course of mineral waters, a sea-voyage, or
other change of life or scene constitutes the best means of avoiding
frequent relapse.It need hardly be said that an ulcer in the rectum, which is readily
recognized by its attending tenesmus, calls for local treatment; and it
is equally plain that tuberculosis or syphilis requires appropriate
internal means of relief.{830}

HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.GENERAL REMARKS.--Hemorrhage of the bowels occurs in both sexes, though
more frequently in the male, and at all ages, though more frequently at
the middle period of life.In the infant a form of it is sometimes
considered as a distinct affection under the head of melaena
neonatorum, and in age it sometimes shows itself as a distinct sign of
a disease characteristic of age--namely, cancer.According to the
tables of Bamberger, it is caused in the order of frequency by
dysentery, typhus fever, cancer (of the colon), mechanical injury,
poisons and foreign bodies, ulceration (tubercular, follicular), the
round ulcer of the duodenum, and aneurism; last and least frequent is
the so-called vicarious hemorrhage.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the intestinal canal arises from (1)
anomalies in the contents of the bowel; (2) disease of the wall of the
bowel; and (3) from general diseases.(1) The inspissation of the natural contents of the bowel during
long-standing or habitual constipation may convert the feces into dense
masses which irritate and scratch the mucous membrane, and thus induce
hemorrhage directly by simple solution of continuity, or indirectly as
the result of extreme hyperaemia.Such hemorrhage is nearly always
slight, streaking or coating the surface of the scybalous mass or being
extruded from the anus as a small deposit of blood during the last act
of defecation; in which latter case it is found mostly associated with
hemorrhoids or fissure of the anus--conditions which require separate
description.Independent of these conditions, the hemorrhage nearly
always has its origin in the lowest regions of the large intestine,
where condensation of the feces is naturally greatest.Foreign bodies in the intestinal canal descended from the stomach may
also be the cause of hemorrhage in the same way.Thus, stones of
fruits, bones of fish, fragments of oyster-shell, or other substances
in no way connected with aliments (false teeth, buttons, pins and
needles, etc.), may be swallowed accidentally or purposely (as by
children or the insane) to produce intestinal hemorrhage.Drastic
cathartics (podophyllin, gamboge, etc.)and poisons (arsenic, mineral
acids) occasionally act in the same way.Thus, Tardieu reports[1] the
case of a servant to whom was administered by a homoeopath veratrin
with coffee, with fatal effect in six days.At the autopsy, made by
Amussat and Reymond, the stomach and small {831} intestine were found
filled with a dark-brown or black bloody fluid, but there was no trace
of perforation, ulceration, or organic disease.[Footnote 1: _Annales d'Hygiene_, July, 1854.]Under this head mention should be made also of certain parasites whose
habitat is the intestinal canal, the walls of which they perforate.Two
varieties, the Anchylostoma duodenale and the Distoma hepaticum, are
frequent causes of hemorrhage, the former from the duodenum and
jejunum, the latter from the rectum, in hot climates, more especially
in India and Egypt.(2) Anomalies in the intestinal walls produce hemorrhage as the result
of intense hyperaemia (per diapedesin) or of actual loss of substance
(per rhexin).Copious, even fatal, hemorrhage has thus ensued from
dysenteric and typhoid processes (and even without discoverable cause)
where no ulceration or loss of substance could be discovered on
autopsy; and this accident is so frequent as the result of ulceration
in the diseases mentioned as to constitute a characteristic sign or
complication.It must be said, however, that cases of alarming or fatal
hemorrhage without apparent cause during life or lesion after death
were more frequently reported in the literature of the times preceding
our more accurate knowledge of pathology and pathogeny.Few clinicians
or pathologists would now be content with reports made without full
knowledge of the history of the case or microscopic examination of the
intestinal walls.Thus, the report to the Societe Medicale d'Emulation,
April 2, 1834, by Dubois of a young man who quickly died of intestinal
hemorrhage five days after a severe headache, and on the same occasion
by Guillemot of several similar cases, would awaken the suspicion of
masked typhoid fever; and the case of an old man aged seventy-four who
died of intestinal hemorrhage after four days' diarrhoea, reported by
Husson,[2] would call for a close examination of the vessels in the
intestinal walls.In fact, Bricheteau, who reported a case from the
Hopital Neckar, was able on autopsy to discover a rupture in a small
artery of the intestines.[Footnote 2: _Proceedings of the Anatomical Society at Paris_, 1835.]Embolic processes leading to the formation of ulceration (by
predilection in the duodenum) are often attended with intestinal
hemorrhage, which would be more constantly present were it not for the
fact that, as in the stomach, the speedy establishment of collateral
circulation prevents the consequences of complete infarction.Besides dysentery and typhoid fever, tuberculosis and syphilis are
occasional causes of ulceration and necrosis of the intestinal walls
which may be attended with hemorrhage.Cancer of the intestine most
frequently affects the rectum, but wherever situated may show
hemorrhage as one of its signs.The local hyperplasia of the mucous tissue which constitutes a
polypus--and which in children, in whom it most frequently occurs, is
mostly situated in the rectum--is suspected to exist or is recognized
by the frequent discharge of blood from the bowels.A far more grave
affection of the intestinal walls, likewise most frequent in childhood,
is the peculiar dislocation known as intussusception or invagination.This condition is so commonly attended with distressing evacuations of
blood and mucus as to simulate dysentery.The strangulation of the
intussuscepted mesentery with its vessels easily accounts for the
hemorrhage in such cases.A more extensive compression is exercised at times by tumors in the
{832} abdominal cavity, as by pregnancy, ovarian growths, etc.,
occlusions in the course of the portal system (cirrhosis hepatis),
interference with the general circulation, as in diseases of the heart
or lungs, with intestinal hemorrhage as a consequence.Diseases of the blood-vessels themselves, as amyloid degeneration,
aneurism, should not be omitted from the list of factors possibly
productive of this result.(3) The general diseases attended with hemorrhage from the bowel are
characterized for the most part by more or less general disintegration
or dissolution of the blood, with the manifestation of hemorrhage in
various parts of the body--kidneys, uterus, subcutaneous tissue, etc.;
the enterorrhagia being an accidental localization, so to speak, of the
effusion.The most prolific causes of this disorganization are the
micro-organisms which "touch the life of the blood corruptibly;" and
hence the various acute infectious diseases may show in the severer
forms hemorrhage from the bowels.Under this head may be ranged
variola, which boasts even of a hemorrhagic form; typhus, yellow, and
malarial fevers; the forms of nephritis marked by uraemia, cholera,
icterus gravis, erysipelas, etc.Disintegration of the blood or partial
dissolution of its corpuscular elements occurs also in those obscure
affections which constitute the group, or are included in the
description, of the hemorrhagic diatheses, as haemophilia, leuchaemia,
pernicious anaemia, scurvy; of any of which enterorrhagia may be a
distinct or dangerous sign.Melaena neonatorum is the distinct name given to a hemorrhage from the
bowels which occurs a few hours or days after birth, and which is often
so profuse as to cause death at once or in a short time.In most cases
no anatomical lesions can be discovered after death, save an intense
hyperaemia of the intestinal mucosa, so that the etiology of this
affection is involved in obscurity.The various causes assigned in its
production--ulceration of the stomach or duodenum (Bohn), embolism
(Landau), fatty degeneration (Steiner), premature ligature of the
umbilical cord (Kiwisch)--answer only for individual cases.Betz
reported a case in a family subject to haemophilia, and Trousseau once
saw twins thus affected; but that heredity cannot account for all cases
is shown by the fact that it occurs mostly in healthy children from
healthy parentage.Klebs is inclined to attribute the affection to the
action of micro-organisms, introduced perhaps as the result of
puerperal infection, but this cause can be assumed in only a small
minority of cases; at least, but a small percentage of cases coincide
with puerperal disease on the part of the mother.Eichhorst states that Hecker
observed it but once in 500 births, and Gemich but once in 1000 births.According to Rilliet, the hemorrhage is oftener (8/14) intestinal,
rarer (4/14) gastric, and rarest (2/14) both.It is almost always
abundant and quickly repeated, the blood being mostly pure, in clots or
masses and fluid, though it is sometimes commingled with meconium.It
usually ceases within twenty-four hours, though it may continue for
three, five, or more days.Of 23 cases reported by this author, 12
recovered and 11 died.MORBID ANATOMY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels, being only a symptom of
very many different conditions, is marked by lesions characteristic of
the condition in an individual case.These lesions are more
appropriately described in connection with the various diseases.Not
{833} infrequently in these cases the intestine is distinguished by the
absence of any lesion at all; but, from whatever cause, hemorrhage from
the bowels, like hemorrhage from any other source, shows a more or less
profound anaemia of all the internal organs, and in more chronic and
protracted cases leads to fatty degeneration, more especially of the
heart.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels is usually readily
recognized by the discharge of blood, either pure or mixed with the
natural contents of the alimentary canal.The actual seat of the
hemorrhage may, however, only rarely be recognized by the rectal
speculum.The colicky pains, borborygmi, or sensations of fluids in the
abdomen which are occasionally experienced may not be relied upon in
fixing the seat of the effusion.Should the hemorrhage occur in
quantity, or, more especially, should the seat of the effusion be low
in the intestinal canal, the blood which escapes is more or less pure.When the hemorrhage is higher, or when the stay of the blood in the
bowel is longer, it becomes more or less incorporated with the contents
of the bowels or altered by the intestinal juices to present a
discharge of mushy or semi-fluid consistence, of dark-brown or black
color.So-called tarry stools are thus largely composed of blood.But serious, even fatal, hemorrhage sometimes occurs without the escape
of any blood at all.Such are the so-called cases of concealed, occult,
or internal hemorrhage, in which the nature of the malady is only
suspected or recognized by the general symptoms attending the profuse
loss of blood.Should the hemorrhage be gradual, anaemia slowly
supervenes, with hydraemia and subcutaneous dropsy.Traube reports a
fatal case of oedema of the glottis from such a cause.Sudden
hemorrhage announces itself by pallor and prostration, dyspnoea,
vertigo, and syncope.Amaurosis, tinnitus aurium, formication, emesis,
and, if the disease be high up in the intestinal canal, haematemesis,
are the common attendants of serious hemorrhage.In the worst cases of
sudden effusion the patient may present the appearance of complete
collapse, and the intestinal canal be found on autopsy distended with
blood throughout a great part of its course, while no blood whatever
has escaped from the rectum.In such cases, or with more gradual loss
of blood, the patient experiences a sense of increasing weakness, the
skin becomes cold and bedewed with a clammy sweat, the pulse grows
feebler, the temperature falls, and death from exhaustion more or less
speedily ensues.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in any quantity in the stools is
readily recognized by its coarser characteristics.Ridiculous errors
have been made by mistaking the coloration produced by bismuth, iron,
logwood, etc.administered internally, or by coloring matters
introduced into the discharges for purposes of deception.The
microscope, Zeichmann's test for blood-crystals, and in extremely
doubtful or medico-legal cases the spectroscope, furnish easy means of
detecting blood in whatever quantity or character.It is the cause and seat, rather than the existence, of the hemorrhage
that mostly cause embarrassment in differential diagnosis.Hemorrhage
from the lungs, nose, or stomach is usually readily excluded by the
absence of any evidence of disease of these organs, and the presence of
the other symptoms of any general disease attended with enterorrhagia
makes a diagnosis in most cases easy enough.Alterations in the
contents of the {834} bowel, the presence of foreign bodies, are
recognized by the history of the case and by careful local examination,
while a diagnosis of anomalies in the walls of the bowel is usually
reached by exclusion.In no doubtful case should local inspection or
digital examination of the anus and rectum be omitted.TREATMENT.--As in all cases of hemorrhage, the first requisite is
absolute rest.The patient should be at once put to bed and kept
perfectly quiet.Many a case of hemorrhage in typhoid fever is produced
by arising from bed to go to stool.The bed-pan is an absolute
necessity in the management of a case of typhoid fever after the second
week of the disease.Rest is the chief agent in prophylaxis as well as
therapy.The most effective styptic in enterorrhagia is cold.An ice-bladder
should be laid upon or suspended immediately above the abdomen during
the whole duration of the flow.The injection of ice-water into the
bowel should be practised only in cases where the hemorrhage is
believed to come from the colon.Otherwise, the peristalsis it awakens
may only aggravate the danger.Should rest and cold fail to quickly
check the hemorrhage, resort should be had at once to ergot.This
remedy, in the form of ergotin, is most effective when introduced
beneath the skin.In cases of less imminent danger the practitioner may
be content to give the remedy by the mouth.Small doses of the simple or camphorated tincture of opium frequently
repeated speedily arrest contractions of the bowel, and at the same
time feed the brain in threatening syncope.The astringents
proper--tannic acid or its preparations, acetate of lead, alum, the
perchloride of iron--are seldom necessary or advisable, but may be
called for in obstinate or protracted cases.To turpentine has been ascribed, from time immemorial, specific virtues
in relief of hemorrhage of the bowels, and its administration is still
a routine system with many older practitioners.It is most effective in
large doses--one drachm, with milk or in emulsion, every hour or two
until the hemorrhage ceases.In relief of collapse, alcohol, ether, and musk are imperatively
indicated, with the external application of heat; and in the treatment
of the anaemia and hydraemia the preparations of iron, including,
later, the mineral waters which contain it.In the worst cases of
sudden alarming hemorrhage the physician should not fail to practise
the transfusion of blood or solutions of salt or soda.Milk is the best food and drink during the attack, and after it for
some days or weeks.Chopped or scraped raw beef may substitute it
later, while all farinaceous foods are to be strictly avoided for some
time.{835}

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION.BY HUNTER MCGUIRE, M.D.When a mechanical impediment to the passage of the contents of the
bowel along the intestinal canal exists, the condition is known as
intestinal obstruction.The causes of this occurrence are numerous, the
symptoms urgent, the diagnosis difficult, the treatment uncertain, and
the termination, unless relieved by nature or art, speedily fatal.There is no class of cases to which the practitioner is called more
important, or which demands on his part greater skill and judgment.It is customary to divide the causes of obstruction of the bowels into
two great classes--acute and chronic.In acute cases the attack is sudden, the symptoms violent, and, unless
the cause is speedily removed, life ends in a few hours or at most in a
few days.In chronic cases the causes act comparatively more slowly,
the symptoms are chronic and less urgent, and danger of death less
imminent.In this class the cause is not uncommonly spontaneously
relieved, and the individual restored to perfect health without the aid
of medicine or the surgeon's art.This result may happen in apparently
the most desperate cases.This classification of acute and chronic obstruction is necessary for a
proper clinical study of the subject, but it should be remembered that
in practice there will be found some cases which partake of many of the
symptoms of both acute and chronic obstruction, making it difficult to
determine to which division the cases properly belong.It will also be
seen that some, at first, well-marked acute cases subside and become
chronic in character, and that (old) chronic cases of obstruction
sometimes suddenly change their nature and become acute.Again, some of
the causes mentioned as giving rise to acute obstruction of the bowel
in rare instances produce symptoms of chronic obstruction, and some of
the causes referred to as giving rise to symptoms of chronic
obstruction in rare instances provoke signs of acute obstruction.As a rule, the following list embraces
conditions which produce symptoms of acute obstruction:

1.Impaction of foreign bodies, gall-stones, enteroliths, etc.Twisting of the bowel--volvulus.Internal strangulation by loops, bands, false membranes,
diverticula, mesenteric pouches, slipping of a portion of bowel into
natural or unnatural openings, diaphragmatic hernia, etc.As a rule, the following causes produce symptoms of chronic intestinal
obstruction:

1.Stricture of the bowel, sometimes cancerous.Contraction of the bowel from inflammatory changes, often
tuberculous.A consideration of external hernia is, of course, not included in this
paper, but the possibility of the symptoms of intestinal obstruction
being due to this cause should never be overlooked.Congenital Strictures and Malformations.Cases of congenital strictures and malformations are confined almost
wholly to the rectum and anus, and come more properly under the
province of the surgeon.Some of the cases, however, belong to the
physician, the obstruction being so slight as not to require surgical
assistance.With all of them, however, the physician should be
familiar, that he may be able to distinguish between congenital
malformation giving rise to immediate obstruction and other forms of
intestinal occlusion.He should know, too, when to seek the aid of the
surgeon.For these reasons, as well as to make the history of the
causes of intestinal obstruction as complete as possible, it has been
thought proper to include in the list congenital occlusion and
malformation of the intestine.They will be treated, however, in the
briefest possible way, and the reader is referred to works on surgery
for a more detailed account of the pathology, symptoms, and treatment.When congenital occlusion of the colon occurs, it is almost invariably
found in the sigmoid flexure, and is due, as most congenital atresia of
the intestine, to foetal peritonitis.Congenital occlusion may be found
in any portion of the small bowel, but a frequent site is the lower
part of the ileum and the ileo-caecal opening.The following case[1]
gives an example of a form of stricture of the duodenum in infants,
with the symptoms and pathological changes.The septum is supposed to
be an unnaturally developed valve, or two valvulae conniventes united:
"A child when born presented no unusual symptoms for the first
twenty-four hours.Vomiting then came on, and continued with short
intermissions until death, which took place some thirty-eight hours
after birth.The only
disease found was stricture of the duodenum close to the entrance of
the gall-duct, so that a probe passed down the latter entered the
duodenum immediately below the constriction.There was nothing to
indicate in what manner the constriction had occurred.On the gastric
side of the latter the duodenum was immensely distended--so much so
that at first sight it appeared like the pyloric end of the stomach
itself, and only by a more careful examination was the distinction
between the stomach and intestine detected by a ridge running around
their place of junction."Pollock in Holmes's _System of Surgery_,
from _Pathological Transactions_, vol.{837} Cases like this, a number of which are on record, are instructive
and of pathological interest; when, however, congenital occlusion
exists in the small intestines, no treatment can be suggested.If the
sigmoid flexure is the part involved and diagnosis can be made, opening
the intestine in the right groin and establishing an artificial anus
should be attempted.In the development of the foetus the anal part of the bowel, beginning
below, develops upward, and the intestinal portion, commencing above,
grows downward; both portions, advancing, finally unite, making one
continuous tube.When, however, there is some interruption in the
foetal development of the intestine, and the two portions of bowel fail
to unite, we have malformation of the rectum and anus and intestinal
obstruction; or the two portions of bowel may have been united and
continuity of the intestinal track established, and subsequent
intra-uterine inflammation may obliterate the canal.Under these
circumstances a ligamentous cord represents the original tube.The cord
descends from the cul-de-sac in which the upper part of the bowel ends
to the skin about the anus, or is lost in the tissues about the neck of
the bladder.In congenital malformations the following conditions may
be found: 1st.The anal orifice may be so minute as not to allow the
feces to escape; or the aperture may be occluded by a membrane, through
which the meconium may be seen; or the anus may be entirely absent.The rectum may be occluded by a membranous septum, the presence of
which is not suspected until symptoms of intestinal obstruction arise,
and then it is discovered by introducing the finger or a probe; or the
rectum may be entirely absent, the colon terminating in the iliac fossa
in a dilated pouch, or ending at the top of the sacrum or stopping at
any point between this and the normal anus, the place being determined
by the period of arrest of foetal development; or, the anus being
absent, the rectum may open into the vagina, bladder, urethra, and
other places.Intestinal obstruction may arise from the introduction, accidental or
otherwise, of foreign bodies into the stomach and bowels.Coins,
marbles, bullets, fruit-seeds, etc.are often swallowed by children,
sometimes intentionally, and if the object is round and small it rarely
gives rise to any serious trouble.The foreign body, however, if small,
may drop into the appendix vermiformis or some other diverticulum and
end in serious mischief, or if the individual has stricture of the
bowel the foreign body may be arrested by it.Foreign bodies which are pointed or irregular in shape, swallowed by
accident or design, may give rise to dangerous and fatal symptoms, but
not unfrequently they escape per vias naturales.Thus, pins, needles,
pieces of bone, artificial plate and teeth, small pen-knives, and other
pointed or irregular-shaped bodies, have passed in this way.Sharp-pointed bodies, as needles, sometimes make their way through the
walls of the stomach and present themselves at other and more distant
parts of the body.I have removed a needle from the calf of the leg
which {838} the patient had a month before accidentally swallowed.Jugglers accidentally, in practising their calling, and insane people,
not unfrequently intentionally, introduce into the stomach all sorts of
foreign bodies, such as buckles, forks, spoons, knives, pieces of wood,
iron, bone, etc.Gross[2] records the case of a juggler who let a bar
of lead ten inches long and weighing a pound slip into his stomach.Bell of Iowa removed it by gastrotomy, and the man recovered.Agnew[3]
reports a post-mortem of an insane woman in whose intestinal canal he
found three spools of cotton, two roller bandages, a number of skeins
of thread, and a pair of suspenders.[Footnote 2: _System of Surgery_, by S. D. Gross, 6th ed., vol.[Footnote 3: _Agnew's Surgery_, vol.The morbid appetite of some people, particularly girls and pregnant
women, sometimes induces them to swallow powdered chalk, magnesia, and
other substances, and when this practice is continued for a long time
the insoluble powder is deposited in the bowel and forms hard masses
which more or less completely obstruct the intestines.Stony concretions or enteroliths are found generally in the caecum or
in the sacculi of the colon, very rarely in the small intestines.They
are round or oval, and when two or more are found together they have
facets.They consist usually of carbonate of lime or magnesia or
sesquioxide of iron.Other concretions are sometimes seen composed of
starch or the felted husks of oats, called oat-stones (avenoliths),
found particularly among the poorer classes of people in Scotland.Other vegetable remains of husks, fibres, etc.Young and middle-aged people more frequently suffer with these
concretions than the old.Foreign bodies made up by the gradual
accumulation of hair, string, and other substances are not unfrequently
found in the stomach and intestines.The mass produced in this way is
often very large.Sometimes the foreign body is arrested in the
oesophagus.In a post-mortem reported to the writer by Fairfax a large
copper coin, accidentally swallowed a few days before, was found lodged
in the gullet.Ulceration followed, a neighboring artery was opened,
and the patient died from hemorrhage.Impaction of the bowel by gall-stones escaping from the gall-bladder
into the bowel is by no means an unfrequent cause of fatal obstruction.Small gall-stones, after giving rise to intense pain and often grave
symptoms during their passage through the bile-ducts, may escape into
the duodenum and be discharged through the rectum, as any other small
foreign body.If, however, there is constriction or stricture of the
bowel at any point, the small gall-stone may lodge there, and if other
stones follow and lodge, the collection may soon be great enough to
produce obstruction.A very large single stone or a number of stones
forming a coherent mass may collect in the gall-bladder, slowly distend
the dilatable biliary passages, and escape into the bowel; or--and this
is more common--an opening made by ulceration between the distended
gall-bladder and the duodenum allows the concretion to escape into the
small intestine.These stones or aggregation of stones are sometimes
three, four, or five inches in circumference and from one to four
inches long.They occur, as a rule, in people over fifty years of age,
and more commonly in women.Brinton, in his excellent book on
_Intestinal Obstruction_, makes the average age in these cases
fifty-three and a half {839} years, and from the statistics he has
gathered it will be seen that their occurrence is four times as often
in females as in males.In 41 cases collected by Leichtenstern, 32 were
women and 9 men.The site of the impaction is always in the small
intestines.In 32 cases observed by Leichtenstern, 17 were found in the
lower part of the ileum, 10 occupied the duodenum and jejunum, and 5
the middle part of the ileum.SYMPTOMS.--Foreign substances introduced into the stomach do not always
immediately give rise to serious symptoms.It is wonderful sometimes to
see how tolerant the stomach is of their presence.Many instances are
recorded of foreign bodies remaining in the stomach for months without
producing dangerous symptoms.The mass may be discharged by vomiting,
or it may escape through the pyloric opening into the intestine, and
ultimately be discharged through the rectum, or, lodging in the bowel,
give rise to symptoms of inflammation and obstruction.If, however, the
foreign mass remains in the stomach, and is not removed by the
surgeon's art or spontaneously discharged by ulceration, as in several
rare instances has been the case, it uniformly proves fatal.Before the foreign body is discharged by ulceration through the walls
of the abdomen, adhesive inflammation unites that portion of the
alimentary canal, gastric or intestinal, in which the mass is lodged
with some part of the abdominal wall.By this union the cavity of the
peritoneum is protected, just as we see the peritoneal sac protected by
an effusion of lymph in hepatic abscess opening into the small
intestine.If the adhesion between the canal and abdominal wall is
imperfect, or by an undue amount of inflammation is disunited, the
foreign body or inflammatory products which surround it may escape into
the peritoneal sac and produce fatal peritonitis.Instead of passing
through the abdominal wall, the foreign substance may escape into the
bladder or vagina, or from the small intestine into the colon or
rectum.Dangerous peritonitis may follow the simple presence of the
foreign body in the alimentary canal from the obstruction it produces
when no attempt at discharge by ulceration has been made.If the size
and shape of the body permit its passage into the small intestine, it
makes its way very slowly along this tube, giving rise to occasional
attacks of colicky pains and symptoms of partial impermeability of the
bowel.At any moment the foreign body may lodge, become impacted in the canal,
and all the grave symptoms of enteritis and general peritonitis present
themselves.Symptoms of inflammation may appear, and after a longer or
shorter time suddenly disappear, as if the foreign body had glided over
some point of obstruction and again begun its descent through the tube.Its course is always irregular, passing quite rapidly over a portion of
the intestine, then going more slowly, then lodging for a time at some
point where it is obstructed by a fold or the contents of the bowel or
by spasmodic contraction of the muscular coat of the intestines.As the
calibre of the small intestine gradually diminishes as it approaches
the caecum, the passage of the foreign body becomes more and more
difficult as it is propelled onward toward the ileo-caecal valve.After
a time it may reach the caecum, where, of all places, it is most apt to
lodge; but it may continue its course to the rectum, where it gives
rise to tenesmus and a constant desire to go to stool.Finally,
spontaneously or aided by the finger of the physician or some
instrument, it is {840} evacuated per anum.Not unfrequently, the
foreign body can be felt through the abdominal walls, and its course
traced day after day as it makes its way along the canal.It is a common practice with uninformed persons to give castor oil or
some purgative medicine when a pin, needle, coin, or other foreign
substance has accidentally passed from the mouth into the stomach.Experience has shown that the
larger and more solid the alvine discharges, the more likely the
foreign body is to escape by the natural outlet; and the physician
should order such a regimen and diet as will probably secure this
condition of the contents of the bowel.Long residence of a foreign mass at any point in the intestinal canal
is certain to produce some chronic enteritis and effusion of lymph and
subsequent stricture of the bowel, or the presence of the foreign body
may produce an ulcer; and when this is healed the resulting cicatrix
may end in serious obstruction from the natural tendency of the new
material to contract.Signs of constriction of the bowel may not be
noticed for some time after the escape of the foreign body.Obstruction from the presence of intestinal stones and concretions is
almost invariably preceded by impaired health, emaciation, or cachectic
appearance, signs of partial impermeability of the bowels, and repeated
attacks of inflammation, especially in the region of the caecum.It
terminates sometimes by the concretion becoming encysted, by its
spontaneous evacuation, or by ulceration and perforation, or sometimes
by complete occlusion of the bowel, and death.As occlusion of the bowel by the presence of gall-stones always occurs
in the small intestines, the symptoms are at once of the most urgent
and violent character.The signs are those of internal strangulation,
and the termination is often rapid in the extreme.Colicky, griping
pains are soon succeeded by violent agony; vomiting begins at once, and
is constant; at first bile is thrown up, and afterward feculent matter;
the pulse is small, wiry, and frequent; the belly is retracted; the
features are pinched, the extremities cold, and prostration soon comes
on, succeeded by collapse.Evidences of disorder of the liver, symptoms of inflammation of the
peritoneum in that region, or attacks of hepatic colic sometimes
precede obstruction of the bowel by gall-stones; unfortunately,
however, for the purposes of diagnosis, these premonitory symptoms are
not invariably present.Acute Internal Strangulation, Twisting, etc.When a portion of bowel within the abdomen is constricted, its
circulation interfered with, and the passage of the contents of the
bowel interrupted, it gives rise to acute internal strangulation.This
condition is very similar to that of external strangulated hernia.The
difference is, that one is inside and the other outside of the cavity
of the abdomen.Twisting of the gut upon its mesenteric axis, the passage of the bowel
through some natural or unnatural opening, the encircling of one
portion of bowel by another or by bands, false membranes, etc., may
cause {841} internal strangulation.It may happen at any age, and
involves generally the small intestine or the more movable parts of the
large bowel--viz.the sigmoid flexure and caecum.Twisting, or torsion, is not an unfrequent cause of intestinal
obstruction, and may involve almost any portion of the intestinal tube.Its most common site is the sigmoid flexure, and next in point of
frequency the caecum.It sometimes, but rarely, involves the small
intestines, and may occur as a simple twisting of one loop of
intestines upon another.First, the mesentery must be elongated.This change in the
mesenteric root may have been caused by the dragging of an old and
large hernia, or the mesentery may have been lengthened by relaxation
of the abdominal walls from childbearing or by the disappearance of
fat.However caused, before torsion of the gut takes place the
mesentery is elongated, so that the two ends are approximated and
something like a pedicle formed.Second, the portion of bowel attached
to the lengthened mesentery may become filled with an enormous quantity
of fecal matter and paralyzed by the great distension.In this paretic
condition it may be displaced by the living, moving parts around it,
and become bent and twisted, or the length of bowel belonging to the
elongated portion of the mesentery may be the seat of inflammation,
and, paralysis following, it becomes without resistance subject to the
pressure and movements of the active vital parts surrounding it.A
portion of bowel with its accumulated contents having a redundant
mesentery and paralyzed by enormous distension or by inflammation, or
by both, may readily be twisted more or less completely, and in some
cases several times upon itself.The weight of the bowel and its contents, along with the rapid
distension of the intestine above, fixes the gut in this state of
torsion and effectually prevents it from untwisting.A semi-rotation of
the paretic and distended bowel about the mesenteric axis is sufficient
to interfere with the supply and return of blood and provoke enteritis.Indeed, the rotation is rarely sufficiently great to produce complete
obstruction, and the symptoms are frequently rather those of
inflammation than of internal strangulation.For weeks before the final
attack the patient usually has symptoms of intestinal disorder, such as
flatulence, constipation, and spells of colic, due no doubt to the
changes provoked by the elongated mesentery and bent or curved
intestine.When torsion takes place the attack is sudden and the
symptoms violent and urgent.Vomiting, meteorism, insuperable
constipation, and frequently tenesmus, are soon followed by collapse
and speedy death.The patient may die in twenty-four hours; he rarely
lives beyond the fourth day.In some cases excessive tenesmus and
bloody stools are seen in the early stages of torsion of the bowel.The
condition may be mistaken for intussusception, but can usually be
distinguished by the premonitory symptoms of twisting and by the more
rapid course, the sudden meteorism, and quick collapse of the latter.Still another way by which displacement of intestine may occasion
obstruction to the passage of its contents is when a portion of the
intestine has a long and narrow mesentery, and around this mesentery,
which is like a pedicle, another portion of the bowel is thrown,
encircling and compressing it.The accompanying figure, taken from
_Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, gives a good idea of this condition (Fig.It represents a {842} loop of the small intestine placed around
the mesenteric pedicle of the sigmoid flexure.Leichtenstern calls this
"intertwining or knotting of two intestinal loops."Anterior view of the strangulated intestine and
stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]Posterior view of the strangulated intestine
and stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]In consequence of inflammation of the peritoneum and effusion of lymph,
peritoneal surfaces are joined together, and before the lymph is fully
organized these surfaces are separated by the constant movements of the
organs and the change in the relationship of the parts, and strings and
bands of various shapes and sizes are formed in which a portion of the
intestine may become entangled and constricted.Sometimes the bowel
accidentally becomes engaged in a loop or noose of false membrane, or
becomes bound down under a band of fibrin; or, the peritoneal surfaces
of some of the organs having been joined together or to the wall of the
abdomen or pelvis, a loop of bowel may escape into a slit or opening
and become incarcerated; or a fold of bowel may fall into a fissure in
the omentum or mesentery or broad ligament of the uterus or suspensory
ligament of the liver, and become constricted; or the appendix
vermiformis may be twisted around the intestine in such a way as to
cause ligation of the tube, or, by becoming attached to some
neighboring part, it may form a loop through which the intestine may
pass and become obstructed.In the same way the bowel may be
constricted by a diverticulum.Bands entangling the bowel and causing strangulation may be
attached to the fimbriated process of the Fallopian tube or the ovary
or uterus.Indeed, it is impossible to describe in a limited space the
almost infinite ways in which these bands and strings may engage and
incarcerate the intestinal tube (Figs.{843} [Illustration: FIG.An appearance of the natural relations of
the diverticulum to the intestine._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal
extremity.]Internal strangulated hernia may result from the bowel falling into a
pouch of the peritoneum and becoming ligated by the orifice of the
pouch, or passing into the foramen of Winslow, of which there are three
cases of strangulation recorded; or a retro-peritoneal hernia may be
formed; or, more common still, a hernia of the intestine through the
diaphragm.In diaphragmatic hernia an opening is more frequently found in the
posterior part of this muscle.Two hundred and fifty-two cases of this
form of internal hernia have been collected by Leichtenstern, in which
the diagnosis was made in only five cases.He found the oesophageal
opening, a spot just behind the sternum, and a gap between the lumbar
and costal parts of the muscle, the weakest points in the diaphragm.Diaphragmatic and other forms of internal hernia may exist and not
produce symptoms of strangulation either at the time of formation or
subsequently, just as we so commonly see in cases of external hernia.When the bowel is constricted, however, and its circulation interfered
with, symptoms of internal strangulation come on, and are exactly like
the symptoms of external strangulated hernia.The attack is sudden, the
symptoms acute and urgent, and the course and termination very rapid.Unless the constriction is relieved death may take place in twenty-four
hours; life is rarely protracted beyond three or four days.The patient has first eructations, soon succeeded by nausea and
vomiting.The matter vomited consists of the contents of the stomach,
then of gastric fluid, bile, and the contents of the intestines.When
the last is ejected the vomiting is called fecal or stercoraceous.The
patient complains of a sense of constriction about the abdomen, griping
pains about the umbilicus, flatulence, tenesmus, and insuperable
constipation.One or two free stools from the large intestine below the
site of strangulation may be passed, but this should not deceive the
practitioner.As a rule, peritonitis soon follows strangulation.The
belly becomes tympanitic and tender, the pulse small and wiry, and the
face anxious.When gangrene supervenes the pain subsides, the pulse
becomes weak and intermittent, the surface cold and clammy, and the
patient soon dies in a state of collapse.Slight delirium may precede
death, or the mind remain unimpaired to the end.Very often, when
gangrene sets in and pain disappears, the patient has a grateful sense
of relief and is hopeful of recovery.{844} Intussusception, Invagination.One of the most frequent and important causes of intestinal obstruction
is intussusception or invagination of the bowel; by which term is meant
the protrusion or slipping of one portion of bowel into a portion
immediately adjoining.This condition is sometimes found after death in persons old or young,
but particularly the latter, in whom during life there were no symptoms
of intestinal obstruction or intestinal trouble of any kind.The
displaced intestine in these subjects is easily reduced, is unattended
by any signs of inflammation, and is evidently the result of spasmodic
contraction of the transverse muscular fibres of the bowel at one part,
with distension and relaxation at another part, by which, just before
death, one piece of the bowel is pushed into an adjacent piece.Not
unfrequently two or more invaginations are seen in the same subject.Flint[4] counted as many as fifteen in a child who died of typhoid
fever.This invagination of the death-struggle almost invariably
involves the small intestine, and may be the protrusion of a piece of
the bowel above into a piece immediately below, or the reverse, a
portion of bowel below being pushed into a portion above.It has been
suggested that this slight and temporary intussusception may occur
during life and give rise to temporary symptoms of intestinal
obstruction, which disappear when reduction of the displacement
spontaneously takes place.[Footnote 4: _Practice of Medicine_.]It will be seen by the diagrams that three successive portions of
intestine enter into the formation of an intussusception--an entering,
returning, and receiving portion.Two mucous surfaces and two serous
surfaces are thus brought into apposition.The mesentery attached to
the included lengths of bowel--viz.the entering and returning
lengths--is necessarily pulled down with the bowel in its descent, and
is also embraced by the receiving portion of the intestinal tube.The
traction excited by this portion of mesentery, thus wedged in between
the middle and inner layers of the bowel, materially alters what would
otherwise be the relationship of the parts.26 shows simple
invagination of the ileum like the finger of a glove, in consequence of
the traction exerted.The entering or invaginated portion does not
always lie in the axis of the enveloping tube, but is more or less
curved, until very often its lower orifice is in contact with the wall
of the outer layer.The concavity of this curve looks {845} toward the
mesenteric edge of the invaginated portion of bowel, and the convexity
toward the opposite side of the receiving portion.The convex side of
the middle cylinder is often thrown into transverse folds or
convolutions.Intussusception, which gives rise to symptoms
characteristic of intestinal obstruction during life, is invariably
from above downward.It is doubtful whether there is on record a single
well-authenticated case of inflammatory invagination where the lower
segment of bowel protruded into the upper.Reference to the diagrams will show that the lumen of the bowel is
diminished, and that more or less intestinal obstruction must follow
invagination.This obstruction is increased by the inflammation which
necessarily follows this condition.The large and numerous
blood-vessels of that portion of the mesentery involved in the
invagination are compressed and stretched; arterial supply, and
especially venous return, are interfered with; congestion quickly
follows, with copious inflammatory exudation; the layers of intestine
become swollen, and blood, sometimes in abundance, is poured out from
the mucous membrane.Peritonitis, limited sometimes to the invaginated
part, more often spreading to the peritoneum covering neighboring
structures, soon begins, and the contiguous serous surfaces are
agglutinated and the intussusception rendered irreducible.Lymph and
other inflammatory products are poured out freely; the coats of the
intestine become distended and thicker, and the inner and middle layers
of the invagination are separated by the deposit; the invaginated part
becomes more and more curved toward the mesenteric border of the outer
layer; and occlusion of the bowel, begun by the invagination, is made
more or less complete by the changes wrought by inflammation (Fig.That intestinal obstruction is not always complete in intussusception
is shown by the fact that fecal matter, often in considerable quantity,
is passed through the bent and narrowed tube, the intestine retaining,
at least for a time, its contractile power.The changes produced by
inflammation are chiefly seen in the inner and middle layers of
intestine, the receiving or outer layer of the invagination often
escaping any serious damage.These changes vary with the character and
duration of the inflammation.Sometimes they are limited to an
agglutination of the opposed serous membranes, an effusion of blood and
serum from the mucous surfaces, and an enormous distension and swelling
of all the invaginated parts; or the inflammation may end in
mortification of the middle or both the inner and middle cylinders, the
dead part coming away in shreds or in large fragments, or, if the
patient lives long enough, the entire invaginated tube being discharged
through the anus.If the inflammation involves the invaginated parts
unequally, strips and shreds of the bowel are detached by ulceration
and sloughing, and may escape in the discharge from the bowels in
pieces so small as to be unnoticed; but if the intussuscepted part dies
en masse, a circular line of demarcation is formed by ulceration, and
the dead segment is detached and drops into the cavity of the bowel
below, and escapes through the rectum.It is often so complete that the
inner and middle cylinders can be recognized, and the part of the
intestinal tube to which the expelled bowel belonged can be determined.In favorable cases the blood-vessels of the healthy bowel above and
below the dead segment pour out a circular mass of coagulable lymph,
which, becoming organized, closes the breach and {846} completes the
intestinal tube.To accomplish this it is necessary that the ends of
the two portions of bowel should be accurately coaptated: if they are
not, some opening may be left through which the contents of the gut may
escape into the peritoneal cavity, producing fatal peritonitis; or the
new formation may be imperfectly organized, and burst during some
peristaltic movement of the bowel or from the pressure of gas
accumulating in the gut; or the supply of lymph may be so redundant as
to obstruct the calibre of the bowel, or end in cicatricial
contraction, stricture, and obstruction.Aitken[5] records four
instances where the curved end of the invaginated portion of bowel by
prolonged pressure caused ulceration and perforation of the coats of
the enclosing bowel, the invaginated portion passing through the side
of the enclosing segment and projecting into the cavity of the
peritoneum.[Footnote 5: _Science and Practice of Medicine_.]Gangrene and ulceration, however, do not always follow intussusception.The mesenteric injuries may be sufficient to produce congestion and
exudation, and the patient survive the invagination for weeks, and
death eventually occur without sloughing or ulceration; or spontaneous
reduction of the invagination may take place and recovery of the
patient follow.The last termination must be rare, and impossible when
firm adhesion between the serous surfaces has taken place; but that it
does exceptionally occur is proved by cases where the diagnosis of
intussusception was undoubted, the invagination being felt in the
rectum or seen prolapsed through the anus.The most common termination,
if the patient survives, is mortification of the invaginated part and
separation in mass or by shreds or fragments.Intussusception may occur in any portion of the intestinal canal, but
some points are more liable to it than others.of the
cases collected by Brinton were ileo-caecal; in 32 per cent.the small
intestine alone was involved; 28 iliac and 4 jejunal; in 12 per cent.the colon, including its sigmoid flexure, was the part implicated.When the rectum is involved, it usually forms the outer layer of the
invagination, the middle and inner layers being formed by the bowel
which has passed from above into it; when prolapse of the rectum itself
occurs, the mucous membrane is generally alone involved, but along with
this the muscular coat may also descend and a true invagination of the
rectum be found.The most common variety of intussusception is the ileo-caecal.It is in
this form that we find the greatest length of bowel involved.This
invagination begins generally at the ileo-caecal valve, the lips of
which at first turn toward, and descend into, the cavity of the caecum,
drawing with them the end of the ileum; in this case the valve forms
the lowest point of the invagination.If the invagination continues,
the end of the caecum is next inverted; and if the process still goes
on, more and more of the colon is invaginated, until in some rare cases
it traverses the whole of the large intestine, appearing just above or
even protruding through the anus.In this variety the vermiform
appendix lies between the middle and inner layers of the
intussusception, and its opening, usually stretched and enlarged by the
inverted caecum and inflammatory effusion, is found close to the
ileo-caecal orifice.In this intussusception the caecum and colon are
large and roomy, and the invaginated portion not so liable, {847} as it
is when the small intestine is alone implicated, to strangulation and
sloughing; nor is there seen in ileo-caecal intussusception, unless the
portion of bowel involved is very short, the marked curvature of the
invaginated portion so commonly found in the small intestine.In the
ileo-caecal form it is twisted or much convoluted rather than bent.Another variety of ileo-caecal invagination--very rare, however--is
where the ileo-caecal orifice does not descend into the cavity of the
caecum, but the lower end of the ileum passes through the valve into
the large intestine.In this instance the invaginated portion is
tightly compressed by the valve, and strangulation is speedy and
complete.An invagination may occur in the lower part of the ileum, and
the inner and middle layers pass on to the ileo-caecal valve, and be
arrested at that point, and afterward, in consequence of violent
peristaltic action, the whole intussusception, inner, middle, and outer
layers, be invaginated into the colon.In this way the invagination
becomes doubled.While intussusception may occur in either sex and at all periods of
life, it happens nearly twice as often in males as in females, and is
most frequently seen in childhood.Leichtenstern[6] found in his
statistics of 473 cases that one-half were seen in children under ten
years old, and one-fourth of all intussusceptions occurred in children
from four to twelve months old.Invagination of the small intestine is
found almost exclusively in adults.Brinton from his records gives the
mean age of its occurrence 34.6 years.According to the same author,
the average age of ileo-caecal invaginations is 18.57 years, and
one-half of all cases of this form of intussusception observed by him
were in children under seven years of age.Leichtenstern states that
the lower part of the ileum is the most frequent site of invagination
in the small intestine, and the descending colon and sigmoid flexure
the most common portion involved in intussusception occurring in the
large intestine.cit._]

The mechanism of intussusception is probably not always the same.The
following is thought to be the most frequent process: A segment of
bowel becomes paralyzed by local peritonitis, some injury, diarrhoea,
or colic, and while in this state a segment of bowel above is subjected
to violent peristaltic action, and is forced into the unresisting
portion below.In this case the paretic segment forms the outer or
receiving layer of the intussusception.Leichtenstern believes that the
paretic portion is turned in and invaginated into the normal bowel
below, and that the clinical course of intussusception and post-mortem
appearance correspond with this explanation.If such is the case, the
paralyzed portion forms the inner layer, and the active bowel below the
receiving layer.Another theory, which applies with much force to the
most common of all invaginations--viz.the ileo-caecal--is, that as
violent anal tenesmus produces prolapse of the rectum, so prolonged and
powerful tenesmus at the ileo-caecal opening may cause prolapse of the
lips of this orifice, and, eventually, invagination of the ileum, or of
both this and the caecum, into the colon.When we remember that the
ileo-caecal valve is furnished with a sphincter muscle, the analogy is
complete.The idea so long entertained that intestinal worms may
occasion invagination of the bowel has generally been abandoned.A
polypoid tumor, by dragging down the portion of bowel to which it is
attached, may produce invagination; and {848} Brinton's statistics give
5 per cent.of cases of intussusception from this source.An
examination of a larger number of cases would probably show a much
smaller percentage due to this cause.A majority of cases of intussusception, however, take place suddenly,
without previous diarrhoea, colic, traumatism, or ill-health of any
kind, and probably occur without any tenesmus or paresis of a portion
of bowel.It may be that the longitudinal fibres of a segment of gut
contract, dilating and shortening a portion of the bowel; while this
part is distended a portion immediately above may be lengthened and
narrowed by contraction of the circular fibres, and violent peristalsis
going on at this moment, aided, possibly, by contraction of the
muscular wall of the abdomen, forces the upper and narrow segment into
the lower and dilated one.At first the invagination involves a small portion of the bowel, but,
active peristaltic action continuing, it rapidly increases in size.This increase is made at the expense of the sheath or outer layer,
which turns in to form the middle layer.The length of the invagination
varies from two or three inches to three, four, or five feet.The symptoms of intussusception generally come on suddenly, and
indicate both intestinal obstruction and inflammation.Pain resembling
violent colic, and referred to the site of the invagination, is a
prominent symptom.The pain is intense, paroxysmal in character, but
after a time it becomes continuous.At first pressure gives relief, but
in a few hours tenderness, denoting peritonitis, appears, limited to
the invagination or spreading gradually over the whole abdomen.Vomiting soon follows, and, with rare exceptions, is persistent.After
two or three days occasionally blood and sometimes fecal matter are
ejected from the stomach.Diarrhoea, with bloody, mucoid stools, is
rarely ever absent, and is characteristic of invagination.The patient
has from fifteen to twenty passages a day.If the large intestine is
involved, the diarrhoea is accompanied with tenesmus.Above the
obstruction gas and ingesta accumulate, and produce abdominal
distension, sometimes well marked.Generally the tumor formed by the
invagination can be felt through the abdominal wall, and is a symptom
of great importance.Meteorism and peritonitis may render the existence
of the tumor obscure or altogether prevent its recognition, but in
intussusception of the colon and at the ileo-caecal valve the solid
cylindrical mass can usually be found, and frequently, when the small
bowel alone is implicated, a very careful and patient examination will
enable the observer to detect it.Sometimes it changes its site, size,
and shape; occasionally it can be felt in the rectum or is seen
protruding through the anus.The urgency of the symptoms of invagination depends upon the portion of
bowel involved and the degree of constriction of the gut and its
attached mesentery.When the bowel is tightly constricted the symptoms
are acute, and the patient may die in a day or two; when the bowel is
not constricted the symptoms are chronic in character, and in the early
stages not urgent.The difference here is like that between
strangulated and incarcerated hernia.In acute cases the attack is sudden, obstruction complete, and the
symptoms those of internal strangulation of the bowel, often followed
by collapse, which may destroy life in a few hours.These cases are
{849} chiefly jejunal and iliac invaginations, and the higher up in the
small intestine the seat of obstruction the more violent and urgent the
symptoms.Constriction, being great, is followed by engorgement and
inflammation of the invaginated bowel, and if the patient lives long
enough gangrene ensues, by which the obstructing mass is separated and
discharged en masse or in fragments through the anus.Not unfrequently
life is saved in this way.That gangrene has taken place and separation
of the invaginated segments is in progress are often known by the very
fetid character of the evacuations and by their admixture with blood
and shreds of necrosed bowel.When the sequestrum has been detached
entire, it is often passed with difficulty.Frequently it lodges at
some point in the bowel, producing temporary obstruction and giving
rise to tenesmus and pain as it passes along the large intestine.There
is no doubt that the continuity of the intestine above and below the
neck of the invagination has been established, and complete cures
effected in the way already mentioned.Usually, however, the patient
dies from collapse, peritonitis, or perforation of the bowel before the
obstructing mass can be removed by gangrene.Children almost invariably
die before this can take place, and adults live from the seventh to the
fourteenth day, according to the greater or less violence and acuteness
of the symptoms.When the slough has been discharged and the continuity
of intestine established, recovery is still uncertain, and death very
often happens for reasons referred to in speaking of the separation of
the sequestrum.Separation of the invaginated portion and its expulsion, according to
Leichtenstern, in the majority of cases takes place from the eleventh
to the twenty-first day, but in chronic cases it is often delayed for
months.According to Brinton, separation of the sequestrum occurs
between the eighth and fifteenth in intussuscepted small intestine, and
between the fifteenth and twenty-second days in acute cases of
ileo-caecal and colic invaginations.In chronic cases of intussusception, which usually embrace the
ileo-caecal and colic varieties, strangulation is not common and the
course of the disease is protracted.These cases often last for several
months, and the symptoms are not always well defined.At first the pain
is paroxysmal, with long intervals of ease.Vomiting succeeds, but is
not persistent; discharge of the contents of the bowel below the seat
of lesion takes place and afterward fecal matter from above this point,
because the permeability of the bowel is not usually lost in chronic
cases.Eventually the alvine discharges become bloody, mucoid, and
characteristic of intussusception; the severity of the symptoms may
gradually increase, the pain becoming greater, more constant, the
vomiting more incessant, the discharges from the bowels more frequent,
and in one, two, or three months the patient dies from asthenia.Several authentic cases are related where the disease lasted one or two
years before terminating fatally.Very often some days before death the
pain and tenderness cease, and the operations become free from blood
and normal in character.Constipation is a prominent symptom in all of the conditions which give
rise to intestinal obstruction, and habitual constipation or loss of
the powers provided for the advance of the contents of the intestines
not unfrequently leads to permanent occlusion of the canal.It is
impossible to fix any definite rule as a standard of health for the
number and quantity of alvine evacuations.Some individuals have a
passage from the bowels once every day; others, in the enjoyment of as
good general health, suffer from the ordinary inconveniences of
constipation if they have less than two or three daily fecal
discharges; others, again, apparently equally as well, have a movement
from their bowels once in two or three days or once a week, or even
once in two weeks.Habershon[7] records the case of a "woman sixty
years old who from youth upward had had a passage from the bowels only
every six or eight days, and whose health had been perfect."A lady
under my own observation, for twenty years never had an alvine
discharge oftener than once in two weeks, and three times in her life
had passed two months without a movement of her bowels.This lady was
the mother of several children, and, although not in perfect health,
was able to attend to her ordinary household duties.Such cases are not
very uncommon, and occur, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more
frequently in women than in men.[Footnote 7: _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, quoted by Leichtenstern in
_Ziemssen's Cyc.The number of fecal evacuations and the quantity discharged have been
shown by Bischoff and Voit to depend, to some extent, upon the
character of the food ingested, vegetable diet producing abundant, and
animal diet scanty, stools.Doubtless, the quality of the food partly
explains the quantity of the alvine evacuation, although, to some
extent, this must depend upon the time that the feces remain in the
colon, a long residence there taking away a greater part of the watery
constituents and making the fecal mass thicker and harder; but the
variations in the number of stools in persons living on the same diet
can only be explained by the variations in the activity of the
peristaltic action in different individuals, or in the same individual
at different periods and under different surroundings.The causes of habitual constipation are of the most varied and
diversified character, and it is not always possible in an individual
case to point out the original or primary one.Not unfrequently several
causes are in operation at the same time to produce sluggishness of the
intestinal canal and constipation.Very often it begins with change of
scene and habits, by which the daily visit to the water-closet is
interfered with, or after confinement to bed with some temporary
indisposition.It is more likely to occur in men and women whose habits
are sedentary and who are constitutionally lazy and indolent.The feces
are allowed to remain in the rectum and colon, and every hour after the
ordinary time for going to stool diminishes the watery parts of the
fecal mass and makes it harder and more consistent.Many cases of
chronic constipation, begun in this way, have ended in dilatation and
thickening of the intestine, ulceration of the mucous membrane, and,
eventually, perforation of the coats and escape of the contents of the
gut into the peritoneal cavity.Rapid {851} excretion of water by the
kidneys, lungs, and skin produces constipation by withdrawing a large
proportion of the water from the fecal mass, rendering it unnaturally
dry and of diminished bulk.In diabetes, constipation arises from this
cause unless the patient makes up the loss by drinking an unusually
large quantity of water.Constipation in nursing-women is explained by
the loss of water in the secretion of milk.The profuse sweating which
attends malarial fever, phthisis, and other diseases readily accounts
for the constipation which often accompanies these disorders.Certain articles of food not necessary to mention here produce
constipation.They fail to excite peristaltic action; or articles of
diet which at first act as a stimulus to the bowels, and even provoke
temporary diarrhoea, lose their power if kept up too long--just as
certain purgative medicines lose their force if continued for too long
a period.Gradually they cease to increase the peristaltic action, and
rather add than otherwise to the inactivity of the intestines.Eating
the same kind of food day after day is very apt, sooner or later, to
result in diminished sensibility of the intestinal canal, a reduction
of the peristaltic force, and deficiency in the secretion of the
digestive juices, which in itself is a common cause of constipation.Frequent change of diet is generally needed to supply the stimulus
necessary for that intestinal motion which relieves the bowels.Bile is looked upon as one of the most powerful agents in stimulating
peristaltic action, and when, from any cause, mechanical or otherwise,
it is not poured into the bowel, constipation ensues.Unnatural
flexures, congenital or acquired, of the large intestine are not
unfrequently the source of chronic constipation.These flexures, normal
or factitious, favor accumulation of feces, especially in subjects who
have diminished sensibility of the bowel and a paretic state of the
muscular coat.Certain injuries and diseases of the brain and spinal
cord reduce, and sometimes altogether prevent, intestinal activity.Hysteria, if it exist for any length of time, is generally attended by
sluggishness of the bowels, and great mental depression (melancholia)
is sometimes preceded and sometimes followed by habitual constipation.In treating such a case it is important to make the distinction.Temporary paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel, followed by
symptoms of intestinal constriction, with insuperable constipation,
sometimes attends violent contusion of the abdomen.In some cases
prolonged functional weakness of the muscular coat follows the injury.Many chronic diseases leave the bowel in a sluggish condition by the
pathological changes produced in the intestine.The function of the
muscular coat is frequently injured by the infiltration which
accompanies peritonitis.The fibres are separated by the serous
effusion which attends this inflammation; they become overstretched,
and, losing their contractility, end in paralysis and obstinate
constipation.Occlusion of the canal from this cause may last for days,
and be accompanied with tympanitis, stercoraceous vomiting, and all the
signs of internal strangulation, ending in death.Post-mortem
examinations in such cases show no stricture or unnatural diminution in
the size of the canal, but that the fatal occlusion was due to
paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel and arrest of its power.The normal advance of the contents of the bowel is interfered with by
any cause which lessens the contractility of the muscular coat.Chronic
{852} diseases which debilitate the general muscular system affect at
the same time the contractile power of the muscular coat of the canal,
and the debility and degeneration of old age are felt here, and
sometimes occasion the constipation which often accompanies this period
of life.Leichtenstern[8] says that chronic intestinal catarrh is a
common factor of constipation--that when this catarrh is of long
standing it produces relaxation of the muscular coat and diminishes the
elasticity of the intestinal walls.He believes that this pathological
condition exists in a large proportion of the cases of habitual
constipation attended with mental depression, that the hypochondriasis
makes its appearance after the constipation has become chronic, and
that it is a secondary symptom.This affection is located chiefly in
the small intestine, and does not usually involve the colon.cit._]

Probably the most common form of chronic constipation is that which
accompanies loss of sensibility and muscular inactivity of the colon
and rectum.The large bowel becomes sometimes so distended by the
accumulated fecal masses that it has been found after death to measure
ten or fifteen inches in circumference and to contain an astonishing
quantity of feces.Any part of the canal, except the last two inches of
the rectum, which is kept empty by the contraction of the sphincters,
may be occupied by the mass, but the accumulation is greatest in the
rectum, caecum, and sigmoid flexure.At the last-named location the
distension is so great that the mass can be readily felt through the
abdominal walls.The tumor may be as large as a foetal head, and may be
mistaken for a simple or malignant tumor of the omentum, stomach, or
other organ, or for pregnancy or ovarian growth.The dilatation may be
so enormous as to push the small intestines into the back part of the
abdominal cavity and to interfere with the function of any organ upon
which it encroaches.It may press upon the concave surface of the
liver, and, arresting the flow of bile, produce jaundice or
mechanically interfere with some portion of the track of the urinary
organs and <DW36> their functions.When situated in a portion of the
canal not tightly attached to the abdominal walls it is slightly
movable, more or less hard and consistent, according to its duration,
for it remains often for months unchanged, sometimes giving to the
fingers the impression of a rather soft, easily-indented swelling with
a uniform smooth surface--more often feeling like a hard, irregular,
elongated, and corrugated mass of fecal balls.Contraction here and
there of bundles of the circular muscular fibres of the gut produces
the irregular, corrugated impression imparted to the fingers.Their
shape and position may sometimes be changed by pressure through the
abdominal wall.If the accumulation occurs in the rectum, the
introduction of a tube or bougie is prevented by the impacted mass,
which can be gotten away only by the fingers or by some instrument.The
colon and rectum may be dilated to their utmost capacity with an
enormous amount of feces, enough to fill a common-sized pail, and both
the patient and medical attendant be deceived as to the sufferer's
condition by the fact that he has his daily number of stools.The
semi-fluid contents of the small intestines find their way through this
mass by some irregular and uncertain track, undermining and breaking
down sometimes a lump of the old fecal accumulation, which, if small in
size or broken up, may pass on and {853} escape by the anus, but if
large and hard may drop into the irregular and uncertain passage and
permanently close it; then sudden and complete intestinal occlusion
takes place, with all of its fearful consequences.If this, however,
should not occur, and the accumulation is not recognized and removed,
the enormous dilatation may go on until complete paralysis of the
muscular coat is produced, and entire stoppage of the current of feces,
with permanent occlusion of the bowel; or before this takes place
ulceration may set in, partly because of the great pressure of the
fecal mass upon the mucous membrane, and partly from the irritating
character of the contents of the bowel.Ulceration begins, most likely,
at some point where resistance is greatest, and perforation of the
bowel may ensue.SYMPTOMS.--If the accumulation occupies only a portion of the colon, as
the caecum or sigmoid flexure, the distended part may become displaced
and twisted on its long axis.This condition scarcely ever happens in
the large intestines except at the parts mentioned.Torsion of the
caecum rarely takes place except in persons of from forty-five to sixty
years of age, while twisting of the sigmoid flexure may happen at any
period of life.When distended and very heavy from the weight of feces,
with probably some congenital defect about its mesenteric attachment,
the sigmoid flexure may become twisted and drop into the pelvis,
producing at once symptoms of internal strangulation.Individuals accustomed to having one or more alvine evacuations a day
are made uncomfortable by two or three days of constipation.A feeling
of distension about the abdomen, with flatulence and heat, follows this
condition, and soon afterward headache, loss of appetite, and symptoms
of indigestion supervene.If this state of the bowels continues
unrelieved, pressure upon the hemorrhoidal veins takes place and
interference with venous return, producing congestion in the lower end
of the rectum.This is attended by straining, diarrhoea, evolution of
gaseous matter, colicky pains, and possibly sympathetic disturbance of
the genito-urinary organs.When at last the hardened and enlarged mass
is discharged, it produces some pain and burning about the anus, with
possibly rupture of the mucous membrane in that region.Fissure of the
anus may thus originate.In the case of a lad aged about nine years
under my care fissure of the anus began in this way, and after its
formation the pain of defecation was so intense that he resisted for
ten days every attempt of his bowels to move.After this time he passed
every day or two one or more hardened fecal balls, but always with such
atrocious pain that he looked forward to the next attempt with terror.This case ended in fecal impaction, which nearly proved fatal.Not unfrequently persons who habitually go two or three days without
having a passage from the bowels are not apparently inconvenienced, and
after a time any of the discomforts ordinarily felt from constipation
are not noticed, if indeed any exist.Generally, however, chronic constipation leads to a host of troubles of
the most varied character.There is not an organ in the body that is
not more or less influenced by it.The generation of gas in the
intestines produces a sense of fulness of the abdomen and elevation of
the diaphragm which interferes with the action of the lungs and heart.The sufferer is oppressed, sighs, and has difficult respiration and
attacks of {854} palpitation of the heart.The influence of the
abdominal pressure is conducted by the sympathetic nerves to the brain,
and the patient frequently has vertigo, headache, ringing in the ears,
faintness, etc., and in consequence of the pressure upon other nerves
or of hyperaemia of the spinal cord and its membranes he has dull
aching pains in his back, groins, genitals, or extremities.I have seen
in several instances pain in the legs, coming on after the patient has
retired and lasting until morning, violent enough to prevent sleep, at
once permanently relieved by an active cathartic after antiperiodics,
alteratives, and anodynes had failed to do any good.A patient suffering from habitual constipation usually obtains
temporary relief by the bowels acting either spontaneously or after a
dose of medicine; but, the causes of constipation continuing, the
physical discomforts and suffering continue, varied in every
conceivable way.His digestion being disturbed, appetite poor, and
assimilation imperfect, he gradually loses flesh and his complexion
becomes sallow and unhealthy.In addition to this, he soon grows
irritable and fretful, trifling affairs trouble him, he has fits of
great mental depression, and soon settles down into hypochondriasis,
his life becoming a burden to himself and a nuisance to his friends.If the constipation ends in fecal accumulation, the worst symptoms of
mechanical obstruction may present themselves at any time, and death of
the individual follow.The practitioner should always keep this fact in
mind in treating every case of intestinal obstruction, and search for
fecal impaction by examining the rectum and the whole length of the
large intestine through the anterior abdominal wall.Very often
symptoms of impaction come on gradually in one who has been ailing for
some weeks or months, but sometimes the onset is as sudden as in a case
of acute occlusion of the intestines.The patient is seized with pain
like that of colic and an urgent desire to empty his bowels, but all
attempts to do this are futile, and the straining is followed by great
exhaustion; borborygmus, nausea, vomiting, and possibly hiccough, soon
come on, with tympanitic distension of the belly.If the impaction is
not overcome, death by collapse or from peritonitis follows.Post-mortem examination shows enormous fecal accumulation, peritonitis
as a consequence of the obstruction, perforating ulcer in some part of
the large bowel, more often the sigmoid flexure, or, in some cases,
absolute rupture of the caecum itself, and escape of its contents into
the peritoneal cavity.In a report by George Pollock[9] of 127 cases of intestinal
obstruction, 77 belonged to the above class; and Brinton, in his
analysis of the whole group of cases collected by him, says stricture
constitutes about 73 per cent.In 124 cases of intestinal obstruction
reported by Mr.Bryant[10] from the post-mortem records of Guy's
Hospital, 47 were found to be stricture of the bowel.The above
statements show that stricture, or diminution of the calibre of the
bowel, is the most frequent cause of {855} intestinal obstruction, and
the subject is worthy of our earnest consideration.[Footnote 9: _Medico-Chirurgical Review_, 1853.][Footnote 10: _Practice of Surgery_.]While stricture of the bowel may be found in any portion of the
intestinal canal, it occurs most frequently in the sigmoid flexure and
rectum.Brinton found in 100 fatal cases of stricture 30 in the rectum
and 30 in the sigmoid flexure; only 8 cases in 100 were in the small
intestine.Brinton's statistics correspond very nearly with those of
other writers.The affection is more common in men than women, and the
average age at death is about forty-four years.The most common cause of stricture is contraction following
cicatrization of ulcers of the mucous and submucous coats of the
intestine.The ulcer may involve the circumference of the bowel, and
the resulting cicatrix terminate in uniform constriction of its lumen,
or the ulceration may extend several inches along the side of the
intestine, ultimately causing contraction in the direction of its
longitudinal axis, marked stenosis, and kinking of the gut.When
ulceration, continuous or in patches, involves a large extent of bowel,
it may reduce the gut to a mass of indistinguishable cicatricial
tissue.Bristowe[11] says he has seen the whole caecum thus contracted
"into a channel barely capable of admitting a goose's quill."[Footnote 11: Reynolds's _System of Medicine_.]Stricture of the intestine often follows dysentery or tubercular and
syphilitic ulceration of the bowel.Follicular or hemorrhoidal
ulceration is sometimes the beginning of a stenosis which ends in
stricture of the rectum.Stercoral ulcers of the colon are not
unfrequently the starting-point of cicatricial contraction of the
calibre of the bowel.Sometimes, but rarely, ulcers of typhoid fever
end in constriction of the intestinal tube.The diameter of the gut is
also contracted by the effects of caustic substances, by ulceration
following the lodgment of foreign bodies, and by effusion of lymph or
thickening attendant upon long-standing hernia.Very often after death
it is impossible to determine what particular kind of inflammation and
ulceration caused the stricture.Generally, the cause which provokes
the ulceration sets up chronic peritonitis, which materially aids in
producing the obstruction.Spasm of the circular muscular fibres
usually accompanies these lesions, and materially contributes in many
cases to fatal intestinal obstruction.Some authors assert that spasm
without organic change can produce acute obstruction: such an
occurrence, except possibly in the rectum, must be very rare, if indeed
it ever happens.The most common cause of stricture is cancer.This disease may
originate in the bowel itself, or, beginning in some neighboring organ
or tissue, gradually spreads and involves the gut.It may extend around
the bowel or be infiltrated along the sides of the canal for several
inches, and may be scirrhous, medullary, or epithelial in character.of the cases of cancer of the bowel are situated in
the rectum.Usually, but not invariably, cancerous deposits are found
in persons who have passed middle age.An impediment to the passage of fecal matter is invariably produced in
constriction of the intestine from the above causes, and it frequently
continues until fatal occlusion occurs.The contents of the bowel
accumulate above the block, producing distension of the gut and
thickening of the muscular coats above the stricture, with contraction
and atrophy {856} of the portion of intestine below.Dilatation of the
bowel above the seat of lesion is sometimes great enough to cause
rupture and peritoneal extravasation, or distension and stretching of
the coats of the canal may be sufficient to interfere with its
circulation, and ulceration ensue.Occasionally cases of stricture or well-marked circumscribed
contraction of the bowel are seen which give rise to no marked symptoms
of constriction during life.Such was the case in the instance related
by Bristowe and referred to above.These instances are, however,
exceptional in the large intestine.Symptoms of stricture vary according to the site, cause, and extent of
the lesion.They are gradually developed, and in this respect are
unlike the symptoms of internal strangulation or of intussusception,
which are generally acute and rapid in their course.When the
obstruction in stricture is complete, progress toward death is
comparatively slow.If the stricture is seated in the small intestine,
the symptoms are often so obscure that for a long time the presence of
the contraction may not be suspected; the contents of the small bowel
are usually fluid, and in this state readily pass through the
constricted part.The more solid the contents of the bowel, the greater
the difficulty in passing a contracted and narrow orifice, and the more
conclusive and characteristic the assemblage of symptoms of obstruction
from stricture.The history of a case of intestinal obstruction from stricture is often
instructive.For weeks or months there have been colicky pains and
intestinal disorder; possibly, in the early stages, diarrhoea, but
later marked constipation, and probably previous attacks where
constipation was for a time insuperable and death from obstruction
imminent.Hemorrhage, except in cancer or when complicated with piles,
is rare.The attack may come on suddenly, or constipation become more
and more difficult to overcome; violent peristalsis presents itself,
accompanied by pain and abdominal distension, and followed by nausea
and vomiting, the latter often being stercoraceous.During the throes
of pain--for it is paroxysmal--the outline of the distended gut can be
felt and seen through the abdominal walls if they are thin and free
from fat.Unless the stricture is relieved the patient gradually dies
from asthenia.Inflammation is often absent throughout, but enteritis
or peritonitis may come on, or perforation and peritoneal extravasation
ensue and hasten the fatal termination.When the obstruction is in the rectum it can be felt with the finger;
if in the sigmoid flexure, it may be felt with a gum bougie or probe,
but the use of the former is unreliable, and the latter, unless
carefully employed, dangerous.Obstruction at this point, however, is
attended with marked distension of the descending and transverse colon.If seated in the small bowel, the large intestine is flaccid and
collapsed.Careful manual exploration often enables the practitioner to
determine the site of the contraction.Weight, pain, dulness, and
fulness are usually found about the stricture, but these signs may be
of little value when the abdominal wall is thick and unyielding, or
peritonitis or tumor is present, or the contracted portion of bowel is
compressed or drawn out of its proper site.Brinton suggests that the
site of stricture may be determined by the quantity of water which can
be injected through the anus into the bowel.Such an estimation must
often be erroneous, as stricture {857} is rarely ever complete and
fluid may be forced through the constricted part.Indeed, Battey of
Georgia has demonstrated upon dead and living subjects that fluid may
be made to pass through the entire canal from the anus to the stomach.Obstruction due to cancer of the rectum can be determined by digital
examination.When seated in the small intestine or higher up in the
large bowel, the presence of a painful tumor, preceded for weeks by
evidences of impaired nutrition, emaciation, and followed by
lancinating pain, cancerous cachexia, etc., will indicate the character
of the trouble.Compression and Contraction of the Bowel.Obstruction of the bowel is sometimes occasioned by compression or
traction exerted on the intestine by abdominal tumors or cysts.Fibrous
tumors of the uterus, ovarian cysts, hydatid growths, or indeed any
form of abdominal tumor, may by pressure on some part of the intestinal
track produce fatal obstruction.Several inches of bowel may thus be
compressed and rendered impervious, or if traction is exerted by the
tumor, which is often adherent to the bowel, the tube may be sharply
bent or twisted and its action interfered with.A case is reported of
compression of the bowel from a great accumulation of fat about the
colon.Adhesions of intestinal coils from chronic peritoneal
inflammatory changes constitute a large and important class of cases of
intestinal obstruction.This condition is known as contraction of the
bowels: 23 of the 124 cases reported by Bryant were of this character.The usual site of stricture is the large bowel: contraction is far more
frequently seen in the small intestine, and is caused by an effusion of
lymph following simple peritonitis or the inflammation attending the
formation of cancer or tubercle of the peritoneum.Coils of intestine
are matted together or to neighboring parts in this way by bands of
lymph or false membranes, and the action of the bowel interfered with
or obstructed.Constriction of a length of bowel may be found after
death, or a sharp, angular bend by which complete obstruction has been
produced.Circumscribed peritonitis may produce adhesion of a portion of bowel by
bands of lymph to the uterus or its appendages, or to some part of the
large intestine, or to the abdominal wall, and the action of the bowel
become embarrassed by traction, constriction, or bending.In
consequence of the irritation following this condition, spasmodic
contraction may follow and add to the difficulty, or enteritis may
ensue; and this will especially be the case if the circulation of the
part is interfered with, and render complete what before was a partial
obstruction.Distension and fulness of the bowel above the obstruction,
with contraction and emptiness of the portion of the gut below, are
found after death in cases of contraction, just as we see in fatal
cases of stricture.The history of the case and presence of a tumor
will generally enable the practitioner to determine when obstruction is
due to the presence of some adventitious growth.When contraction is
complicated with the presence of tubercle or cancer, symptoms attending
these conditions will be present.Obstruction of the intestines from contraction generally comes on {858}
insidiously.The patient may date the beginning of his trouble from an
old attack of circumscribed peritonitis which probably took place weeks
or months before.He has attacks of colicky pains, indigestion, and
constipation.The last is difficult to overcome, continuing for hours
before it is relieved by medicine or the efforts of nature.During the
attack of almost insurmountable constipation violent peristaltic
movement of the bowel above the impediment may be noticed.The patient
may gradually become more and more feeble from suffering and
interference with nutrition, and die from exhaustion, or fits of
obstinate constipation may continue to recur, until finally one of them
becomes insuperable and fatal.The symptoms of contraction closely resemble those of stricture, but it
is important to distinguish one from the other, as the treatment,
especially if surgical interference is demanded, is very different.A
rigid analysis of all of the signs will usually, but not invariably,
enable the practitioner to make the distinction.There is an important difference between the constipation of stricture
and that of contraction.In the former the difficulty is in defecation,
emptying the large bowel, the usual site of stricture; in the latter
the difficulty is in the passage of the contents of the gut along the
narrowed and contracted small intestine, the common site of
contraction.In stricture the calibre of the bowel is diminished by
some sharply-defined mechanical impediment seated in the cavity or in
the walls of the tube; in contraction the bowel is bent or kinked by
adhesions, or coils of intestine are matted and glued together and
peristalsis interfered with.In stricture defecation is difficult and
painful; in contraction the alvine discharges are painless.In the
former blood and mucus are not unfrequently seen in the feces; in the
latter the motions are healthy.In stricture constipation alternates
with diarrhoea; in contraction looseness of the bowels is rarely seen.In stricture distension of the abdomen is lumbar and epigastric; in
contraction the distension is less and is central and hypogastric.In
both conditions violent distinct peristaltic action is seen during a
fit of constipation, and in both the bowel above the constriction is
distended and hypertrophied.In contraction the powerful, writhing
peristalsis involves the small intestine above the impediment, and in
stricture the large bowel above the obstruction.In both stricture and
contraction inflammation of the bowel and peritoneum may supervene.In
contraction, when inflammation sets in or when enteritis and
peritonitis are absent and the attack of constipation is
insurmountable, I have noticed that the symptoms are more urgent and
rapid in their course, and danger of death from collapse greater, than
when these conditions exist in stricture.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--In every case of intestinal obstruction a
careful examination should be made for external strangulated hernia.All of the regions of the abdomen in which hernia may occur should be
thoroughly inspected, as the symptoms of the two conditions are
identical.A small or incomplete external strangulated hernia may
easily be overlooked.An individual with an old hernia may suddenly
have symptoms of intestinal obstruction, and it may be doubtful whether
the obstruction is due to internal constriction or to the external
hernia.Diagnosis is especially difficult when the chronic hernia is
irreducible in character.If the cause {859} of the impermeability is
internal and below the external hernia, that portion of intestine in
the hernial tumor becomes swollen, tense, and hard, and closely
resembles the local symptoms of strangulated hernia.If the external
hernia is reducible, reduction en masse may take place and a
retro-peritoneal hernia be formed.When the case is doubtful and
urgent, an operation for strangulated hernia should be performed.Functional obstruction of the bowel is sometimes seen, closely
simulating obstruction from one of the structural changes mentioned.Cases of functional obstruction are seen usually in hysterical or
nervous women, and are generally recognized by the history, course, and
termination of the malady.The fact that local enteritis, peritonitis,
or typhlitis, by paralyzing a portion of the bowel, may produce all the
signs of acute and complete obstruction, should not be lost sight of.In cases of congenital stricture or malformation, or the presence of
foreign bodies in the intestine, or acute internal strangulation, or
twisting of a length of bowel, and generally in intussusception,
symptoms of acute obstruction are present.The individual may have been
in perfect health, and suddenly symptoms of the gravest character set
in.Intense pain, referred to some special part of the belly, is the
first sign of trouble.Nausea soon follows, and with it great
prostration; the depression of vital power approaches, and sometimes
reaches, syncope; the patient rolls and tosses in agony; his mental
distress is equally great, and if old enough he is conscious of his
danger and is anxious and despondent.Vomiting succeeds the nausea: at
first the contents of the stomach, and then those of the small
intestines, are thrown up; after a time the vomiting is stercoraceous.The belly becomes swollen, tympanitic, and exquisitely tender; the
weight of the bed-clothes or the slightest touch of the finger upon his
abdomen is intolerable; he keeps his head and shoulders raised and his
lower limbs retracted to avoid pressure of the abdominal muscles.If the abdominal wall is
thin, the violent motion of the intestines can be seen and felt through
it.These painful peristaltic movements of the bowel are paroxysmal and
attended by loud rumbling or gurgling noises.The pain gradually
increases; the patient is very restless and complains of great thirst;
his pulse is small, hard, and frequent, his extremities cool and
features pinched.If not soon relieved, exhaustion comes on; he has
muttering delirium, cold clammy perspiration, hiccough, twitching of
the tendons, and death soon follows from collapse or from peritonitis
or gangrene, or from both.The average period of death is from six to
eight days.It may occur in thirty-six or forty-eight hours, or the
patient may last for two weeks.In congenital occlusion and malformation the history of the case, the
age of the patient, and the fact that the deformity in such cases is
almost always confined to the anus and rectum, usually render the
diagnosis sufficiently easy.Obstruction caused by foreign bodies impacted in the intestines can
generally be diagnosed.The history of the case may show that foreign
bodies have been swallowed or that the patient has been subjected to
some of the conditions which cause the formation of enteroliths.These
stony concretions are usually found in the caecum or colon, and
frequently give rise for days and weeks to symptoms of indigestion,
emaciation, {860} constipation, and other evidences of bad health
before complete occlusion of the intestine takes place.Not
unfrequently, before the sudden attack of impermeability of the bowel
the patient has had repeated attacks of typhlitis, and has been
conscious for a long time of the presence of a tumor in the region of
the caecum or colon.Possibly he has passed on some former occasion
pieces of the stony concretion.Diagnosis of obstruction by gall-stones is often aided by the fact that
the patient has recently suffered characteristic pains of hepatic colic
and by the icterous condition of the skin.Possibly the individual has
suffered repeated attacks of hepatic trouble and has previously passed
a gall-stone.Obstruction from this cause is seen four times as often
in women as in men, and always after the middle period of life.In obstruction occasioned by internal hernia or the presence of
membranous bands, loops, mesenteric pouches, the symptoms are often
such as to baffle all attempts at accurate and certain diagnosis.The
onset of the symptoms is sudden and the course of the disease rapid;
prostration of vital power is extreme, sometimes amounting to syncope;
vomiting incessant and persistent; pain constant and fixed.The most
characteristic symptom of internal strangulation is the very great and
prolonged depression of vital power; it occurs generally in early adult
life.Erichsen states that in twisting of the bowel the abdomen is unevenly
distended, it being tympanitic on one side and flattened on the other.This condition of the bowel is usually seen after middle age.In
intussusception the principal signs are, usually, the early age of the
patient--obstruction from other causes in children being rare--the
suddenness of the onset of symptoms, the frequent desire to go to
stool, the tenesmus, and the characteristic bloody mucus discharges.By
abdominal palpation frequently the sausage-like tumor can be
recognized, and very often the intussuscepted part can be felt in the
rectum or seen protruding through the anus.When invagination involves
the upper part of the small intestine, diagnosis of the cause of
occlusion is almost impracticable.In obstruction of the bowel from fecal accumulation, inflamed and
thickened intestine, stricture, compression and traction, and
contraction of the gut from cancerous deposit, the symptoms are
gradually presented and chronic in character.They are unlike the signs
of acute obstruction, which occur in persons apparently in perfect
health and are sudden and violent from the beginning.In chronic
obstruction of the intestine the patient has probably been complaining
for some time, with symptoms of abdominal trouble.He has been unwell
for weeks, his appetite poor, digestion disordered, strength
diminished, and bowels constipated.The last symptom is the most
distressing of all.Purgatives do not give the relief ordinarily
obtained, but add to the griping, colicky pains, nausea, and general
depression.When his bowels do act, the stool is sometimes liquid,
sometimes very hard (scybalous), or the form of the matter passed is
tape-like or pipe-like.Sometimes, in his frequent attempts at stool,
the only discharge is blood and mucus or pus.Attacks of eructation and
vomiting often take place during the progress of the disease.Stercoraceous vomiting is, however, rare, and only seen in the later
period of the attack.Abdominal distension is slow in making its
appearance, but after a time is well marked, and due more to tympanitis
than to {861} constipation; the tympanitic distension is accompanied by
loud rumbling and gurgling noises in the bowels.After a period which
varies much in different cases, inflammation, suddenly or gradually, is
set up, and all the symptoms of acute obstruction are presented,
grafted on signs of chronic occlusion.We have pain, nausea, vomiting,
great distension and tenderness of the abdomen, peristalsis plainly
seen and felt if the abdominal wall is thin, the small, frequent, wiry
pulse, clammy perspiration, prostration with hiccough, tendinous
twitchings, and death, very like that following a case of external
strangulated hernia.Obstruction due to fecal accumulation generally happens in persons who
have passed middle age, and can often be diagnosed by digital rectal
examination and palpation of the abdomen, by the presence of fecal
tumors, and the history of long-existing constipation with its manifold
consequences; previous attacks of impermeability, and relief by
discharge of enormous masses of feces.Obstruction caused by the presence of some abdominal tumor is generally
known by the history of the case, the fact of the existence of the
tumor being known to the patient or discovered by the physician by an
examination through the abdominal walls or through the vagina or
rectum.The progress of such cases is essentially chronic, but acute
symptoms may at any time come on.Diagnosis of obstruction due to
stricture is frequently made by examination of the rectum and sigmoid
flexure, the usual sites of constriction from this cause.Complete
occlusion from stricture is almost always preceded by well-marked
premonitory symptoms.When the obstruction is situated in the lower part of the colon and
rectum, its precise seat can be determined by digital or manual
examination or the use of a bougie or tube.When the site of
obstruction is above the sigmoid flexure, it is difficult, and
occasionally impossible, to determine its exact locality.As a rule,
when the constriction is in the small intestine the symptoms are acute
and urgent; pain is intense, vomiting comes on soon, and prostration is
early and extreme.When the large intestine is involved, except in
volvulus, the symptoms are generally chronic.In twisting of the gut
the symptoms are rapid and uncommonly severe.The higher up the
obstruction, the earlier stercoraceous vomiting begins.Above the
constriction the bowel is distended and tympanitic; below the
constriction it is generally collapsed.In obstruction of the large
intestine the outline of the tympanitic and distended gut may be traced
with the eye and hand.In constriction of the small intestine the
secretion of urine, as has been shown by Hilton, G. Bird, and Barlow,
is less than where obstruction is seated in the large bowel.Besides
rectal and vaginal examinations, which should never be neglected in any
case of intestinal obstruction, abdominal palpation may also aid in
determining the site of constriction.It should not be forgotten,
however, when a tumor is found--as, for instance, in invagination--that
the bowel may be displaced; a distended caecum may be pushed into and
occupy the left side of the belly.Cases are not uncommon where the
symptoms are so combined and uncertain as to render accurate diagnosis
of the site of obstruction impracticable.Very little light is thrown upon the diagnosis by pain, constipation,
or vomiting when these symptoms are considered separately.Pain is
common to many diseases of the abdomen; obstinate constipation, lasting
for {862} days and weeks, is often seen where there is no mechanical
obstruction; and vomiting attends many morbid conditions of the body.But when these symptoms are combined and examined along with the
history of the case and mode of invasion, they are often characteristic
of constriction of the intestine.Pain in acute obstruction is fixed,
umbilical, and intermittent; in chronic cases it is more diffused and
increases with the distension.In acute cases constipation is complete
and insuperable; in chronic cases this symptom gradually increases; in
intussusception we have frequent discharges of a dysenteric character,
and hemorrhage, sometimes copious, when the small bowel is involved.The bowel below the seat of complete constriction may be full of fecal
matter, and the discharge of this spontaneously or by the aid of
enemata may induce the attendant not to regard the case as one of
occlusion.Stercoraceous vomiting, as a rule, comes on early in acute
and late in chronic cases of complete occlusion of the gut; in
spasmodic ileus or impermeability not due to mechanical occlusion
feculent vomiting is only occasionally seen.The duration of life in acute intestinal obstruction varies very much
in different cases: death may ensue in a few hours or not for ten or
twelve days; the average period is six days.The duration depends upon
the site of the constriction and the mechanical injury to the bowel;
the nearer to the pylorus the constriction, the more rapid the
progress.In volvulus involving the sigmoid flexure, when injury to the
bowel is great, the symptoms are acute in the extreme.After
peritonitis or enteritis begins, progress toward a fatal issue is very
rapid, the patient rarely living more than three or four days.In
occlusion from stricture, compression, fecal impaction, and chronic
intussusception the patient may live for weeks or even months.The statistics of Leichtenstern show that from 5 to 10 fatal cases of
intestinal obstruction occur every year among every 100,000
inhabitants; and according to the mortuary records of England an
average of 1 death from this cause is seen in every 260 deaths.Brinton
reports 1 death from intestinal obstruction in every 280 deaths; his
statement is based upon 12,000 promiscuous autopsies.The first author
states that the statistical reports of the general hospital of Vienna
inform us that out of 60 cases of ileus, 6 or 10 per cent.This report, however, is too meagre to be of much value.From Brinton's
statistics of 500 deaths from obstruction we find that out of 100
cases, 43 are intussusception, 17 stricture, 4.8 impaction of
gall-stones, 27.2 internal strangulation, and 8 torsion.TREATMENT.--There are few conditions of the body which cause the
practitioner more anxiety and embarrassment than cases of intestinal
obstruction, and when the precise seat and nature of the occlusion are
not known the treatment is almost entirely empirical.The distinction,
however, between acute and chronic cases of obstruction of the bowels,
or of acute supervening upon chronic symptoms, can almost always be
made, and a patient investigation of the history of the case, the mode
of invasion, and a rigid analysis of all the symptoms presented will
generally enable the attendant to come to some positive conclusion as
to the cause and site of the occlusion.One fact in the treatment which
cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind, especially of the young
practitioner, is not to use purgatives and irritating enemata, formerly
so much in vogue, {863} in the hope of forcing a passage through the
occluded bowel.The patient is urgently solicitous for medicine which
will open his bowels, but the use of purgatives to overcome internal
strangulation is as senseless and hurtful as when used to overcome the
constipation of external strangulated hernia.These agents only add to
the nausea, vomiting, pain, and peristalsis.The latter is violent
enough already to render coils of intestine visible, and with every
paroxysm is adding to the entanglement and impermeability.It is said
that cathartics in some instances have unlocked the bowel in intestinal
obstruction: these cases are exceptional, and many of them were
probably functional and not structural in character.Mary moved to the office.The only exception
to the rule of avoiding purgatives is as stated by Jonathan Hutchinson:
"In certain cases when impaction of feces is suspected, and in cases of
stricture when fluidity of feces is desirable."Formerly, some of the best practitioners resorted to the exhibition of
one or two pounds of quicksilver, in the hope of overcoming intestinal
obstruction by the weight of the metal.This plan has properly been
almost if not quite abandoned.Crude mercury is very slow to reach the
obstruction, is divided into small portions by the peristalsis, which
its presence increases, and if it should finally arrive at the point of
constriction in any considerable quantity, it is more liable to add to
than overcome the difficulty.The great remedy in intestinal constriction is opium, in large or small
and repeated doses.Its use arrests the vomiting, stops the pain, and
quiets the violent movements of the bowel.Very often by it the
intestine is preserved and the life of the individual saved.No special
dose can be prescribed: it should be administered until slight narcosis
is obtained and pain and vomiting cease.Small doses of morphine, given
hypodermically and quickly repeated, is the best plan of exhibiting it.It may be given by the stomach, but under such circumstances it is apt
to be rejected, or if retained absorption goes on slowly, or possibly
not at all.If for any reason its hypodermic use is impracticable, it
had better be given by the rectum.Opium lessens the danger of death
from collapse: it gives nature an opportunity to untwist the gut in
volvulus, or to unroll it in intussusception, or to cut off the
invaginated part by gangrene; and in internal hernia, morbid adhesions,
strangulation by bands of lymph, stricture, and other forms of
obstruction, it diminishes violent peristaltic action, postpones
inflammatory infiltration, fixation of the strangulated portion, and
keeps the parts in better condition for operative interference, which
in many cases offers the only hope of relief.To carry it farther than
slight narcosis and arrest of the most painful symptoms of obstruction
is an abuse of the remedy.By such abuse the symptoms will be masked
and both patient and practitioner deceived.When obstruction is due to fecal impaction or spasm, the opium
treatment is still often indicated.Not unfrequently, after pain and
vomiting are relieved and slight narcosis kept up for some hours, the
bowels relax and spontaneous evacuation takes place.If not, discharge
of the contents of the bowel should be assisted by the administration
of castor oil, calomel, or repeated enemata of warm water.These agents
should not be used, however, as long as there is pain, tenderness of
the belly, or any evidence of peritonitis, but the opium treatment
continued until all signs of inflammation have disappeared.It has been
proposed to give {864} belladonna in place of opium; in small doses and
carefully watched it may be added to the opium, but should not be
substituted for it.The local application of ice-water or pounded ice to the abdomen has
been recommended; and it is asserted that the danger of general
peritonitis is lessened, and that the strangulation itself has
disappeared, under the influence of cold.If, however, cold increases
pain and peristalsis, it should be abandoned.The local application of
moist heat or fomentations will more probably do good and give a
grateful sense of relief to the sufferer.General bleeding should never
be resorted to, and the use of leeches, except to ward off or subdue
some local inflammation, is of doubtful expediency.Blisters,
ointments, and cups are useless in such an emergency.Cracked ice,
strong coffee, and carbonated water in small quantities are valuable in
allaying thirst and nausea.Cases are reported where obstruction of the bowels has been overcome by
the use of electricity; both the continuous and induced currents, but
chiefly the former, have been used; its value in such cases is
improbable.Abdominal taxis or massage has been earnestly recommended and
frequently practised in cases of constriction.Successful results from
this procedure have been reported.It has been attempted while the
patient was in a warm bath or under chloroform or while taking large
enemata of warm water.Abdominal traction by the use of large cups to
the belly has also been advised.We can only hope for success from
these measures in the early stages of obstruction, before inflammatory
action or fixation of the strangulation has taken place, and any
attempt of this kind should be made with tact and gentleness.Inversion
of the body has also been suggested.The injection of large quantities of warm water into the bowels to
overcome obstruction should never be omitted before resorting to
operative interference.The author has seen this plan in five or six
instances succeed after all other means had failed.Simple warm water
should be used, introduced by means of the common Davidson or a
fountain syringe.The injection should be made slowly, with occasional
intervals of rest, to allow the fluid time to pass through the
intestinal coils.During the operation the patient should be in the
knee-elbow or Sims's left lateral position, and under the influence of
an anaesthetic.One or two gallons of water may be used.In place of
water, the bowel may be inflated with air, introduced by a pair of
common bellows to the nozzle of which a piece of India-rubber tubing is
attached.The addition of castor oil, turpentine, carbonic acid gas,
and other irritants will more likely detract from than add to the
efficacy of these measures.In chronic intussusception, or in acute
cases when fixation of invagination is believed to have taken place,
and especially when inflammation is great, gangrene threatening or in
existence, injections of air or water should not, of course, be
attempted.In invagination, when the intussuscepted part is low down in the rectum
or protruding from the anus, replacement by fingers or sound should be
tried; reduction begun in this way may be completed by injections of
air or water.The propriety of introducing the whole hand into the
rectum is very questionable.In occlusion of the gut by compression and
traction the cause should be found, and, if possible, removed.An
abdominal or pelvic tumor may be pushed out of the way of the
compressed bowel, a cyst punctured, a displaced womb replaced.{865} Great care should be taken to support the strength of the patient
by concentrated and nutritious food, and in the later stages by
stimulants.When the bowels are distended by gas an injection into the
rectum of ten grains of sulphate of quinia will often give marked
relief.It has been proposed to tap the distended gut with a fine trocar when
accumulation of gas is enormous, causing dyspnoea and great general
distress; temporary relief is often obtained by this plan, which is an
imitation of a common practice among veterinary surgeons.Something
more than temporary relief may, however, follow the tapping.In
twisting of the bowel, in internal strangulation by band or loop or
ring, and in some cases of invagination, the constriction is kept up by
the enormous gaseous distension.The obstruction is continued as much
by causes within as without the intestine.When tapped and the gas
drawn off, the bowel collapses, and may escape from its constriction
and return to its natural condition.Tapping is not always certain or
safe.The trocar or aspirating tube may pass between the convolutions
and no escape of gas take place, or it may be followed by fecal
extravasation into the peritoneal cavity.Notwithstanding the risk, the
plan is a valuable one, and in suitable cases should be resorted to.SURGICAL TREATMENT.--In cases of acute obstruction of the bowel from
bands of lymph, diverticula, internal hernia, slipping of a portion of
gut into some opening, or twisting, when the treatment suggested has
been tried and fails, laparotomy should be performed; that is, the
abdomen should be laid open, the cause of the obstruction searched for,
and, if possible, removed.In acute cases a few hours, at most one day,
may be spent in trying the medical means recommended.After that time,
if the patient is not relieved, the sooner laparotomy is resorted to
the better the chance to save life.Acute internal strangulation of the
bowel from these causes has the same symptoms, course, and termination
that acute external strangulated hernia has.It demands the same
treatment--removal of the cause of the constriction.Delay in
performing the operation in the former is as certain to be followed by
peritonitis, gangrene, and death as it is in the latter; and the
surgeon who hesitates to open the abdomen and attempt to remove the
constriction in a case of acute obstruction after a fair trial and
failure of medical measures, is as culpable as the one who delays the
operation of herniotomy for unrelieved strangulated hernia.In rare instances spontaneous self-reduction of external strangulated
hernia takes place; the cases are exceptional, and the fact is no
apology for postponing herniotomy.So in occasional instances acute
internal strangulation is spontaneously relieved; here too the cases
are exceptional, and the occurrence should be no excuse for delay in
laparotomy.To justify the operation it is not necessary that the
precise site and nature of the mechanical impediment should be
determined, although this can usually be done.It is only necessary to
know that the cause of the acute obstruction is not enteritis or
peritonitis, but a constriction mechanical in character, which no
medicine or manipulation or expectant treatment can relieve.When
diagnosis is clear and laparotomy is indicated to save or prolong life
in intestinal obstruction, the aid of the surgeon should at once be
invoked.Peritonitis beginning or in actual existence
makes abdominal section more dangerous and {866} lessens materially the
chances of recovery.To make the operation absolutely the last resort
when the bowel is injured beyond repair, when peritonitis is in full
progress, gangrene threatening, or the patient on the verge of
collapse, is a useless cruelty to the sufferer and his friends, and
only serves to bring surgery into disrepute.If the truth were known,
many of the cases of death following laparotomy should be ascribed not
to the fact that the knife was used, but to the fact that it was used
too late.In intussusception not relieved by medical means the propriety of
abdominal section is questionable.The subjects of this condition are
usually children.Dislodging the invaginated bowel is not always
practicable, and the opium or expectant treatment may end in
spontaneous cure by the bowel righting itself or by sloughing of the
intussuscepted part.It is doubtless true that many of the so-called
cures from the latter process subsequently die from contraction of the
cicatrix at the site of the separation of the slough.In 43 cases
collected by Ashhurst of laparotomy for invagination, 13 recovered and
30 died.The record is bad, and to some extent the heavy mortality is
due to the fact that the operation was put off too long--delayed in
acute cases until sloughing had taken place, and in chronic cases until
adhesion of the invaginated parts had occurred.Indeed, some of the
cases reported were moribund when the operation was undertaken.Recently many successful cases have been reported, and it is fair to
presume that the percentage of recoveries in the future will be greater
than they have been in the past.In acute intestinal obstruction due to bands, internal hernia,
volvulus, or the presence of foreign bodies, as gall-stones, there is
no question that laparotomy should be performed after other measures
for relief have been employed and failed.Death in such cases is
inevitable and imminent, and operative interference should not be
postponed until peritonitis has set in.After the abdominal cavity has
been opened the distended gut can easily be found and the fingers of
the operator carried on down until the site of the constriction is
reached and the cause of the obstruction discovered.If the
constriction is due to the presence of bands or adhesions, they should
be cut or broken up and the gut relieved.If an internal hernia is
found or a portion of bowel has slipped into some fissure or pocket, it
should be withdrawn and the parts restored to their natural position.If the cause of the obstruction is a volvulus, the bowel should be
untwisted.If a foreign body is felt impacted in the bowel and closing
it, unless it can be readily and without danger of lacerating the coats
of the gut pushed on by the fingers of the operator until it has passed
the ileo-caecal valve, the foreign body should be removed from the
bowel by an incision and the wound in the bowel afterward closed by
sutures.If the case is one of intussusception, the invaginated parts
should be pulled out: this is practicable where adhesions are absent or
slight, but if the adhesions are very firm, and it is impossible to
restore the parts to their natural position, the gut should be laid
open above the occlusion, the edges of the opening should be attached
to the margin of the external wound, and a fecal fistula established.If the case of acute obstruction be due to stricture of the small
intestine, which is exceedingly rare, the gut may be laid open, and the
patient recover with fecal fistula, or entorectomy or resection of the
diseased part of the gut be resorted to.The operation of entorectomy
has been recommended by many {867} surgeons, and a large proportion of
the cases reported recovered.In one case by Koeberle six and a half
feet of the gut were successfully excised.The following table by Ashhurst[12] shows the results of laparotomy.It
will be seen that in 230 cases 68 recovered:

[Footnote 12: _Surgery_, p.Enterotomy is an operation originally performed by Nelaton.It is done
by making an incision, preferably in the right groin, above the crest
of the ileum and parallel with Poupart's ligament.When the abdomen is
opened a coil of intestine is found and carefully stitched to the walls
of the incision.A very small opening is then made into the bowel, and
a fecal fistula established.Enterotomy is less dangerous than
laparotomy, as by it there is less interference with the peritoneum;
but no relief could be afforded by this procedure in cases of
intussusception or acute obstruction from bands, hernia, or volvulus.It is applicable to cases of intestinal constriction when the
obstruction is about the lower part of the small or upper part of the
large intestine.It may be resorted to as a palliative measure when
exact diagnosis as to the character and site of the obstruction is not
clear, the case being otherwise hopeless, or in cases of obstruction
where severe symptoms persist and death is near, and yet for any reason
laparotomy or colotomy is inapplicable; or it may be performed in cases
of contractions after failure of patient and persistent medical
treatment.Many successful cases of enterotomy have lately been
reported, and the operation has been earnestly advocated by Trousseau,
Maunders, Wagstaffe, Bryant, and others.In chronic constriction due to
stricture or other mechanical obstructions, malignant or otherwise, not
remediable by any medical measures, colotomy should be performed.By
this operation the colon is opened and an artificial anus established.The sigmoid flexure in the left lumbar region is the part selected for
the colotomy if the obstruction is situated in the gut below that
point.When the obstruction is higher up in the colon or its exact site
cannot be determined, the caecum in the right lumbar region is the part
chosen.In cases of obstruction from the mechanical pressure of tumors,
the possibility of relieving the compressed bowel by treating the
tumors should of course be considered before resorting to colotomy.{868}

CANCER AND LARDACEOUS DEGENERATION OF THE INTESTINES.BY I. E. ATKINSON, M.D.The term cancer of the intestines is used here in a clinical sense to
designate new formations in the intestinal tract the tendency of which
is to destroy life, and has no reference to the histological characters
of the tumors, inasmuch as these are, during life, for the most part,
concealed from the eye of the pathologist.It so happens, however, that
in a histological as well as in a clinical sense the term is
appropriately applied to all but a very few of the malignant new
growths that develop in the parts under consideration, if we adopt, as
seems proper, the opinion of most modern pathologists, that cancer or
carcinoma should only include those tumors "consisting of cells of an
epithelial type, without any intercellular substance, grouped together
irregularly without the alveoli of a more or less dense fibroid
stroma."Carcinoma of the intestines appears either as cylindrical-cell cancer,
as scirrhus, or as gelatinous or colloid cancer.Scirrhous cancer of
the intestines may resemble in appearance and texture the ordinary
medullary cancer, degrees of hardness or of softness depending upon the
predominance of the stroma or of the cellular elements in the
constitution of the tumor.Rarely, and in a purely clinical sense,
cancer of the bowels may exist as a lympho-sarcoma in the small
intestine, and then through progression from the glands of the
mesentery or elsewhere.Primary intestinal sarcoma has, however, been
observed.Similarly, melano-sarcoma has been detected in the intestine
as secondary to this form of sarcoma, originating in the skin or in the
eye.Of the forms of carcinoma, cylinder-cell cancer is the most frequent.Carcinoma gelatinosum or colloid cancer is of great relative frequency,
but it is altogether probable that here, as elsewhere, this represents
a degenerative form of ordinary carcinoma.At all events, it is certain
that it may be detected in many cases where the essential changes
reveal the ordinary glandular or cylinder-cell variety.These forms of
cancer may affect the bowel primarily or secondarily by extension from
adjacent organs and textures, or by metastasis.Primary cancer occurs
most frequently, metastatic cancer with great rarity.The relative
frequency of the different forms of cancer is not definitely known.In
the article on carcinoma in the _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des
Sciences medicales_ (xii.576, 577) cancer of the bowels is said to
constitute about 8 per centum of all carcinomatous new growths.Sibley[1] found that primary {869} carcinoma occurred in the alimentary
canal (exclusive of the mouth, tongue, and the annexed organs) in 6 per
centum of the cases collated by him.Tauchou's compilations of nine
thousand fatal cases of carcinoma show that intestinal cancer was
present in 4 per centum.[2] These computations include cancer of the
rectum.If statistics of cancer of the bowels exclusive of rectal
cancer were available, they would show, doubtless, a much smaller
proportion.[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chir.Transact._, xlii., 1859.][Footnote 2: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vii.Any portion of the intestinal tract is liable to be attacked by cancer,
though undoubtedly some parts of it with much greater frequency than
others.Kohler[3] reported that in thirty-four cases the cancer was
situated twenty-two times in the large intestine (the rectum excluded)
and twelve times in the small intestine (nine times in the duodenum).It is not unlikely that in the cases of duodenal cancer the new growth
extended from the pylorus.At all events, primary cancer is seated with
far greater frequency in the large intestine, and, not including the
rectum, usually in either the sigmoid flexure or the caecum.Grisolle[4] declares the large intestine to be four times more often
affected with cancer than the small intestine; that the sigmoid flexure
is attacked as often as all the rest of the colon taken together; and
that the caecum is still more often affected.Where the intestinal new
growth is secondary to carcinoma elsewhere, it is usually so by
extension from neighboring parts; thus, the ileum may become implicated
by contact with uterine cancer, etc., and cancer of the stomach, liver,
kidney, etc.[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vii.[Footnote 4: _Pathologie int._, 1865, ii.]Cancer of the intestines usually begins after the middle period of
life, and apparently irrespective of sex.Nevertheless, young persons
are occasionally affected, and children sometimes develop malignant new
growths of the bowels (usually sarcomatous), either primarily, which is
rare, or secondarily, by extension from other parts.The influence of
heredity seems not to be well established.There can be no doubt that
chronic irritation may act as an exciting cause of cancer of the
bowels, as it may in cancer of other parts.It has been impossible to
recognize any specific influence from especial forms of irritation, and
it is not likely that such exist.Indeed, the etiological relations of
intestinal cancer remain exceedingly obscure.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Up to a certain period of development cancer of the
bowels will give no sign of its presence; indeed, cases have been
observed where, death having occurred from other causes, the existence
of the malady became apparent only at the necropsy.In all cases the
symptoms are, at first, of an indefinite character and very inconstant.Vague abdominal pains are experienced; these gradually tend to become
referable to a certain locality and to become associated with irregular
action of the bowels.Constipation, alternating with short intervals of
diarrhoea, supervenes, and a varying amount of meteorism is developed.These symptoms may be attended by the signs of failing nutrition.The
body gradually shows the effects of chronic imperfect assimilation, and
becomes emaciated.The complexion slowly assumes the peculiar hue of
chloasma cachecticorum.Long before this occurs, however, the cancerous
new formation usually becomes perceptible as a more or less distinct
abdominal tumor, movable or fixed, as the part affected permits of free
movement {870} or is bound down to the neighboring parts either by
normal attachments or by adhesions resulting from inflammatory
processes or from the extension of the cancerous growth.When the tumor
is movable, it is generally situated in the small intestine or
transverse colon or sigmoid flexure, the other portions of the
intestinal canal being comparatively fixed.It should be mentioned,
however, that portions of the intestines normally freely movable may
become adherent to contiguous parts, as the transverse colon, with the
gall-bladder, liver, stomach, spleen, etc.; the transverse colon
and small intestine, drawn down by the weight of the new growth, with
the pelvic organs, the bladder, uterus, uterine appendages, etc.; and
that, finally, different portions of the bowels may become involved in
one mass.When the duodenum is the portion implicated the tumor may escape
observation or may be indistinguishable from cancer of the pylorus.It
occasionally happens that no tumor can be discovered until the malady
is far advanced whatever part of the bowel is affected.In nearly all
cases, however, before very long the tumor will be detected wherever
situated, but it will often remain difficult, owing to its situation,
to arrive at exact conclusions as to its precise character.Usually, it
offers considerable resistance to the touch, but its features may
readily be obscured by the fecal accumulation that forms above the
constricted portion of the gut and by the gaseous distension of the
bowel.This tumor will be slightly painful to pressure, and the patient
will refer to it a spontaneous pain, usually of a dull aching,
sometimes of a stabbing, character.Percussion yields a sound of
muffled resonance, due to the tubular nature of the tumor.Cancerous
neoplasms of the bowel, and of the duodenum especially, are apt to be
associated with a distinct pulsation caused by the subjacent abdominal
aorta.This may readily be distinguished from aneurismal pulsation by
the absence of an expansile character, by the disappearance of the
impulse that may sometimes be observed when the patient is made to
kneel upon all fours, and by the occasional mobility of the cancerous
tumor.By extension and by inflammatory infiltration the tumor
frequently becomes converted into a conglomerate mass where all
determination of locality becomes conjectural.The tumor is, with very
rare exceptions, single.The symptoms that accompany the development of these growths depend
mostly upon their position in the alimentary tract.Pain alone seems
independent of this, but is at best a most uncertain concomitant.When
the duodenum is the part affected by extension from the pylorus, the
symptoms are indistinguishable from ordinary pyloric cancer.Even
primary cancer of this part may exactly simulate pyloric cancer.The
localized pain and tumor, the vomiting after meals, the frequent
presence of blood in the vomited matters, the progressive emaciation
from starvation, the absence of abdominal distension (a result of the
constriction of the gut at its upper extremity), the gastric
dilatation,--all combine to make the diagnosis difficult.Cancer of the duodenum in its descending part may be suspected when
signs of hepatic and pancreatic obstructive difficulties point to
implication of the ducts, through which are produced jaundice upon the
one hand, and evidences of imperfect pancreatic digestion, in the
presence of undigested fat in the stools, upon the other.In the lower
portions of the {871} intestines the cancer becomes more and more
associated with meteorism and fecal accumulations.Constipation becomes
steadily more obstinate, but there are occasional fluid evacuations
containing blood, pus, and mucus, often stinking abominably.When the
tumor is toward the end of the large intestine--in the sigmoid flexure,
for example--fluid discharges occur with very great frequency at times;
but these are scanty in amount and but slightly fecal in character.In
these cases one does not usually observe the compressed, ribbon-like
stools that are seen in rectal cancer.These symptoms may precede the
appearance of the tumor, when the diagnosis will be less readily made.The constipation will at first be more amenable to the use of
purgatives.(It is said to be due more to a loss of contractility of
the bowel than to the narrowing of its lumen.)Gradually these will
lose their efficacy, and finally complete obstruction of the lumen of
the gut is effected; in which event the symptoms of ileus will develop,
with cramps and vomiting, finally of a fecal character, and the fatal
issue quickly follow.Not unfrequently peritonitis is developed, and
may be of a chronic character or may destroy life within a day or two,
or the patient may die from exhaustion before the obstruction becomes
complete.It may happen that the integument will become involved in the malignant
process, or may become continuous with the tumor by adhesive
inflammation.In such cases an opening may be formed by suppuration, or
the lancet may secure the passage of feces through an artificial anus,
and temporary respite be obtained.Sometimes a sudden disappearance of
the symptoms of obstruction--a result due to the softening and breaking
down of the cancerous mass, restoring temporarily the integrity of the
intestinal tube--may give an unjustifiable hope to the patient; or the
same effect may follow the establishment of a communication, by
ulceration, between the bowel above the tumor and some portion nearer
to the anal orifice.The progress of the new growth soon annuls the
benefits thus gained.Not uncommonly, particles of the cancerous mass may become detached,
and, if diligently searched for, may be discovered in the feces.Microscopic examination may then definitely determine the nature of the
disease.It has been claimed that colloid cancer may be diagnosticated
in this manner even before the appearance of other symptoms.[5] Death
may be hastened by the occurrence of metastatic deposits in other and
vital organs.Oedema of the lower extremities (of the left extremity in
cancer of the sigmoid flexure) will often be observed as a result of
the interference of the cancerous mass with the return of blood from
the extremities by pressure upon the large veins.The combination of
pain, tumor, constipation, tympanitis, progressive wasting, and the
cachexia that sooner or later supervenes, stamps eventually most cases
with unmistakable characters.[Footnote 5: Charon and Ledegank, _Journ.lxviii., 1879, p.The duration of intestinal cancer may extend from several months to
one, rarely two, years, the latter age sometimes being attained by
colloid cancer, the most chronic and least malignant form.MORBID ANATOMY.--By far the most frequently encountered malignant new
growth of the bowel is carcinoma, in one or another of its forms.The
cylinder-cell epithelioma is probably the most common of {872} these,
and, as seen in the intestine, offers many naked-eye points of
resemblance with ordinary encephaloid carcinoma.It is soft, filled
with a milky juice, and may attain considerable size.The tumors appear
as discoid prominences of varying size and number.Later, these may
become fungoid and ulceration ensue.The growths early involve the
whole intestinal wall, and by their increase tend to obstruct the
passage of the intestinal contents.When ulcerated they present a
nodular, uneven surface, situated upon a thickened base consisting of
the infiltrated coats of the bowel.Villous prolongations (villous
cancer; the undestroyed connective-tissue stroma) may project into the
lumen of the bowel and give a peculiar tufted appearance to the part
implicated.One or more points may be invaded by cancerous growth, and
above each will be developed a dilatation of the gut (the result of
distension) containing uncertain quantities of fecal matter, upon the
removal of which the tumor will appear much smaller than it appeared
during life.Scirrhus usually implicates the gut in its entire circumference, so
that a high degree of constriction may result from a small amount of
cancerous infiltration.It begins as small nodules or plates upon the
mucous membrane.As commonly observed, the lumen of the intestine is
narrowed by an annular band of gristly hardness.All the coats of the
bowel, with the peritoneum, become involved, and frequently the
contiguous parts are included in the cancerous infiltration, forming an
undefinable mass through which the contracted channel of the bowel may
be traced, though often impervious to any but the smallest articles (a
crow-quill, for example).The surface of the gut is generally
ulcerated, irregular, and nodular.The walls of the ulcer are irregular
and infiltrated.It will sometimes happen that the autopsy reveals
permeability of the bowel where total obstruction prevailed during the
latter days of life.This may be probably accounted for by the
disappearance of the hyperaemia that doubtless existed during life and
caused more or less turgidness of the growth.Sometimes the
connective-tissue element is less predominant, and gives place to a
more or less luxuriant cell-development; in a word, scirrhous carcinoma
is replaced by soft or encephaloid cancer.This difference is simply
one of degree, but is associated with greater rapidity and extent of
growth.Ulceration is extensive, and one may here also often discover
the villous, tufted appearance of villous cancer, caused by the
fringe-like shreds of stroma entangling cellular elements not yet
detached from the mass.Colloid cancer, or carcinoma gelatinosum, may be associated with either
of the above-described forms as a degenerative form, or may,
apparently, develop as such from the beginning.It is a very frequent
variety of the malady.In 27 cases of intestinal cancer, colloid cancer
was present in 5, as reported by Lebert.It is most often observed in
the sigmoid flexure and caecum, as are the other forms of carcinoma.It
is composed of a considerable mass extending around the bowel.Ulceration is less often found here than in the other forms, nor is
there the same tendency to secondary infiltrations.By the unaided eye
an alveolar structure may be detected, and when the mass is extensive a
soft, jelly-like consistency is presented, together with "a bright,
honey-yellow color."Small deposits of the colloid matter may be seen
upon the surface.These have been described as resembling wheals of
urticaria or herpetic or eczematous {873} vesicles (Bristowe).The
glairy fluid of colloid carcinoma oozes from the cut surface of the
tumor, bathes it, and is to be found in the intestine.These different forms of cancer sooner or later invade neighboring
parts, as the peritoneum, mesenteric and retro-peritoneal glands, and
adjacent organs.On the other hand, the intestines may become invaded
by cancer of the peritoneum and other parts.It has even been observed,
reversing the usual order of things, as secondary to cancer of the
liver (Wilks and Moxon).Under these conditions the symptoms of
intestinal cancer will have been associated with those due to the
primary affection.Lympho-sarcoma will rarely be found as an extension
from the lymphatic glands and involving the small intestine.Melanotic
sarcoma may occur as metastatic from an original melano-sarcomatous
tumor of the skin or eyeball.DIAGNOSIS.--In its earlier stages it is impossible to recognize cancer
of the intestines.After its symptoms have become established they may
resemble those of several disorders.Cancer of the duodenum cannot be
distinguished from that of the pylorus unless evidences of pancreatic
or biliary disturbances indicate obstruction to the passage of the bile
and pancreatic secretions.Previous to the appearance of a tumor one
must often remain in doubt.The alternations of constipation and
diarrhoea, the signs of partial obstruction, the localized pain usually
present, the gradual wasting, will arouse suspicions of cancer, though
chronic inflammatory affections of the bowels may induce symptoms not
altogether unlike these.The presence of a tumor will supply the
additional evidence necessary for a definite diagnosis.It will be
necessary to exclude fecal enlargements of the bowels.The cancerous
tumor will be somewhat painful, hard, nodulated.A tumor due to fecal
accumulation may closely simulate it, and is, indeed, usually
associated with it.By manipulation the fecal mass may be moulded, and
even displaced, and by appropriate purgative treatment may be caused to
entirely disappear.Foreign bodies, mesenteric tumors, and other
abdominal enlargements may offer physical resemblances to intestinal
cancer, but their symptomatology is usually so different that doubt may
be easily dispelled.Syphilitic gummy infiltration, with resulting
stricture, is more apt to occur in the rectum than in other parts of
the alimentary tract.The presence of fragments of the new growths may sometimes be detected
in the stools, when microscopic examination will determine their
nature.With cylinder-cell epithelioma and glandular cancer this is not
common, but with colloid cancer much information may be gained by
examining the evacuations.According to Charon and Ledegank,[6] colloid
cancer of the intestine may be detected before symptoms develop, by the
presence of colloid matter in the feces.In the later stages, however,
the gelatinous change of all the histological elements may occasion
embarrassment, as at this stage the peculiarities of the cellular
structure will have been destroyed.et de Pharm._, lxviii., 1879.]PROGNOSIS.--Intestinal cancer always proves fatal.Death may result
from the debility resulting from the cancerous cachexia or from
intestinal occlusion or from peritonitis.The duration of the malady is
usually not long.It runs its course in from several months to one,
rarely to two, years.{874} TREATMENT.--Treatment must be directed to the alleviation of the
distress caused by the disease.When
the cancer is situated in the colon, especially in the sigmoid flexure,
the operation for artificial anus often affords great though temporary
relief.The diet should consist of such articles in the digestion of
which a large residue is not formed.Milk, eggs, soups, etc.should
compose the principal articles of food.Mild laxatives will be required
to secure the proper evacuation of the bowels, and to relieve pain and
discomfort opium is invaluable and should be freely used.When
obstruction is imminent nutrient enemata afford the most efficient
means of administering nourishment.Lardaceous Degeneration of the Intestines.SYNONYMS.--Albuminoid degeneration, Waxy degeneration, Amyloid
degeneration, etc.Lardaceous degeneration of the intestines is an affection of quite
frequent occurrence in those persons who are the subjects of a like
change elsewhere; for although it has been asserted that it may be
present as a primary affection, it almost always succeeds the same form
of degeneration in other organs.Since, for the most part, it only
makes itself manifest at an advanced stage of the disease, its
importance is usually masked by the grave constitutional condition of
the patient, whose vital forces are wellnigh exhausted by the already
advanced degenerations present elsewhere.The extensive implication of
other organs and tissues in the same degenerative process also creates
great obscurity in the symptomatology of intestinal lardaceous disease,
and is doubtless the cause of the existing dearth of definite knowledge
upon the subject.That the intestines are comparatively frequently involved in lardaceous
disease is shown by dead-house statistics.Thus, Charlewood Turner[7]
reported from the London Hospital that in 58 cases of lardaceous
disease the intestines were affected 10 times; and Goodhart[8] in 150
consecutive necropsies of lardaceous disease at Guy's Hospital reported
implication of the intestines 63 times.[Footnote 8: _Ibid._, p.Although the bowels do not become affected as early as several other
parts, they will almost certainly become involved should the patient's
life be prolonged; and in those cases where death is a direct result of
the degeneration the intestines share with the kidneys the chief
responsibility.It is not, however, until an advanced stage of
lardaceous degeneration that its presence in the alimentary canal is
revealed by symptoms; indeed, many cases do not, throughout life,
betray evidences of the pronounced alterations that are to be
discovered after death.Even in extreme cases there are no symptoms
that would, even with probability, be referred to lardaceous disease of
the bowels in the absence of the same degeneration in other organs and
parts.There are, then, no specific symptoms following lardaceous
degeneration of the bowels.Where the normal functions of the intestines can no longer be properly
performed in consequences of the changes that have taken place in them,
there results a moderate diarrhoea.At first the number of movements
{875} may not be increased; the evacuated matters are fluid and of a
greenish or pale color.Usually, little or no pain is experienced,
though at times and in certain individuals this may be severe and
colicky.The diarrhoea is not always steadily progressive, but may from
time to time disappear.With the progress of the disease it may become
more free and persistent, and in the later stages hemorrhage from the
bowels may be superadded.This may vary in amount, and where, as is
often the case, the stomach participates in the degeneration,
haematemesis may also appear.These hemorrhages may be insignificant,
or may at once assume alarming proportions, and even bring to an
unexpected termination the life of the individual.Already, at the
outset of the intestinal symptoms, the general health will have shown
evidences of profound alteration, but upon the supervention of the
diarrhoea more rapid progress will be observed, consequent upon the
increased nutritive disturbance.The use of remedies in temporarily
controlling this diarrhoea may prolong for months the life they are
powerless to save.So far as concerns the intestinal affection, there is no special
tendency toward febrile excitement.It must not be forgotten, however,
that acute inflammatory attacks of various tissues and organs
frequently arise in the course of lardaceous disease.Though there seems to be reason to believe that mild degrees of
lardaceous degeneration may sometimes be cured, especially when
dependent on syphilis, there is but little hope of arresting its
progress at the late stage when the bowels become implicated.Indeed,
when pronounced degeneration of the bowels takes place the disease is
usually nearing the end of its course; for it is a well-settled fact
that in this degeneration extensive implications of organs may occur
without markedly reducing the patient's general condition, so long as
the kidneys and intestines remain unaffected.The cause of death is
usually to be traced to these organs.Dickinson[9] found that in 35
cases where death was apparently due to renal lardaceous disorder, the
immediate result was brought about by diarrhoea in 13 cases.Presumably, in a large proportion of these lardaceous disease of the
bowel was present.[Footnote 9: _Diseases of Kidney_, Part ii., 1877, p.The degeneration usually affects the lower portion of the small and the
upper part of the large intestine.Occasionally it will be found to
have invaded the whole alimentary tract.As in lardaceous degeneration
generally, the process begins in the small arteries and capillaries and
veins, affecting primarily the arterial and venous muscular coats--not,
however, according to the latest authorities, the muscular fibres
themselves, but their perimysium and the cement substance, the
degeneration being one limited to the connective tissues.[10] In the
mildest cases only some of the small vessels of the mucous membrane are
involved, and no naked-eye changes can be detected.In more advanced
stages the mucous membrane is pale and shows evidence of catarrh.Thickening occurs, and as the process advances a peculiar appearance is
revealed which has been compared to that of wet wash-leather (Wilks).The iodine test now gives the mahogany- reaction of lardaceous
matter, with the tissues affected, or, if the methyl-aniline-violet
test of Cornil be employed, the lardaceous material will display a
red-violet color, while {876} normal structures will be tinged
blue-violet.It is said to be better to make the test near a Peyer's
patch, since the latter is seldom affected by the degeneration, and
brings out, by contrast, the surrounding lardaceous material.[11] This
distribution of the material cannot be considered as constant, however,
since Hayem found the patches of Peyer most frequently affected.[Footnote 10: Cohnheim, _Allgem.[Footnote 11: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.404; Kyber, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.In more advanced stages the surface may become irregular from glandular
enlargement, and ulceration may occur.Microscopic examination shows
the lardaceous material in the vessels, and also in the stroma of the
mucous membrane and villi.[12] The epithelium is not involved.The
degeneration, at first confined to the mucous membrane, extends to the
submucous tissue, the proper muscular coat of the intestines being
often implicated--so far, at least, as concerns its connective tissue.In the more severe cases Hayem found the agminated and solitary glands
extensively involved.Fine branches from affected vessels penetrate to
the interior of the glands.In such cases the mesenteric glands will be
found implicated.The degeneration of the vessels running through the
gland structure causes disappearance of this substance by fatty
degeneration, and occasions a reticulated arrangement of the lardaceous
material, and, secondarily, ulceration.In a similar manner ulcers may
arise in any part of the affected tract.Finally, the lardaceous
material may involve the whole thickness of the gut.[Footnote 12: Eberth, _Virchow's Archiv_, 80, S.The diagnosis of lardaceous disease of the bowels can only be made with
certainty in the presence of pronounced albuminoid disease of other
parts in association with the symptoms of intestinal disorder.Inasmuch as the disorder invades the bowels only at a late stage of its
existence, the prognosis acquires additional gravity.It is probable
that advanced albuminoid disease is never cured; so much the more
hopeless is it when affecting this tract.If unchecked, the diarrhoea
rapidly saps the powers of life; if temporarily alleviated, the
approach of death is more gradual.Whatever attempts are to be made to cure the disease, they must be
through the general system, and are identical with those directed
toward the cure of lardaceous disease generally.Treatment directed to
the intestines must be palliative.The diarrhoea must be combated by
appropriate diet and the administration of such remedies as protect the
surface of the mucous membrane and control the intestinal movement.Bismuth subnitrate in large doses is therefore indicated.Various
astringents may be employed, while the use of opium often secures most
gratifying relief.Preparations
of the crude drug seem to answer better than its salts.The necessity
of keeping the gut free from undigestible matters that may irritate the
already badly-damaged mucous membrane is apparent.Patients with this
form of lardaceous degeneration usually show the cachexia resulting
from profound modifications of nutrition, and their intestinal symptoms
can only be regarded as links in a long pathological chain.Hemorrhage
will call for remedies that under ordinary circumstances are employed
to control bleeding from the bowels.{877}

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.BY THOMAS G. MORTON, M.D., AND HENRY M. WETHERILL, M.D., PH.G.Diseases of the inferior and terminal portion of the large intestine
may be divided into primary and secondary--the former when the morbid
cause is local and independent of disease elsewhere, the latter when it
is consequent upon or incident to some other bodily affection.Among
the primary lesions may be classed congenital malformations, prolapse
of the rectum, hemorrhoids, and some varieties of new growths; also
diseases caused by local irritations, infection, or traumatism, such as
proctitis, ulceration, fissure, non-malignant stricture, chancroidal
invasion and primary syphilis, including obstruction of the bowel by
impacted feces and foreign bodies.Thread-worms and various cutaneous
eruptions about the anus may also be included among the causes of the
primary diseases of this portion of the alimentary canal.The secondary affections are quite numerous, and may be caused by
direct extension of disease from the colon, as in the dysentery
following typhoid fever, and follicular enteritis, or entero-colitis of
children; by contiguity, from diseases in neighboring organs--_e.g._
ischio-rectal abscess causing fistula--or by changes in the nervous or
vascular supply, such as is seen in spasmodic contraction, paralysis,
epidemic dysentery, cholera, and the action of certain remedies.The rectum, the third or terminal portion of the large intestine, has
no sharply-defined upper limits: it is usually understood to begin at
the sigmoid flexure, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis; it is
from six to eight inches in length and terminates in the anus.As the
sigmoid flexure is the narrowest portion of the colon, so the calibre
of the first part of the rectum is narrower than the portion below,
where it gradually becomes more commodious, and near the anus presents
a peculiar condition of the walls which gives it a capacity for
remarkable distension.The rectum, which is somewhat cone-shaped, in
its anatomical and pathological characters retains those of the large
intestine with slight variation.Upon the upper or first part of the
rectum the duplicature of the peritoneum is continued, forming the
meso-rectum, which invests the bowel, attaching it to the sacrum.Below
this the middle portion of the rectum (extending to the tip of the
coccyx) is attached to the sacrum by connective tissue only, but also
has a peritoneal investment on the upper portion of its anterior
surface.{878} The third or terminal part of the rectum, which is only an inch
and a half in length, and is entirely without peritoneal covering,
terminates at the anus.The circular and transverse muscular fibres,
mucous crypts, and appendages throughout the rectum are identical with
those above, except that the general muscular tunic is thicker; but the
longitudinal fibres are less distinctly aggregated into bands than in
the colon, being disposed in a more uniform manner, except that, like
the circular fibres, they are especially aggregated between the
sacculi.The fact that the meso-rectum limits the mobility of the upper
and more narrow part of the rectum has led some to locate a third
sphincter at this point, but the existence of such an organ has not
been generally admitted.Van Buren characterizes it as an organ which
"anatomy and physiology had been equally unsuccessful in assigning
either certainty of location or certainty of function."[1]

[Footnote 1: Kelsey, _Diseases of the Rectum and Anus_, New York, 1882,
p.The anus guards the outlet of the bowel by its double sphincter muscle,
which under normal circumstances affords voluntary control, within
certain limits, over defecation.The well-known peculiarity of the
vascular supply, a sort of erectile tissue being formed by the inferior
hemorrhoidal plexus and the passage of some of the efferent veins
through the sphincter muscle, by which they are subjected to pressure,
is very favorable to the development of certain forms of disease which
will be considered among the local disorders.As embryology has thrown
considerable light upon the pathology of morbid growths by
demonstrating relationships that were previously unsuspected, so a
consideration of the development of the lower portion of the intestinal
canal may lead to a better understanding of some of its diseases,
especially those which are symptomatic or secondary.In early foetal
life the third division of the primitive intestine, the pelvic portion,
terminates in a cloaca in common with the urachus; subsequently, about
the eighth week, a partition (the perineum) is formed which divides the
cavity into two portions, the uro-genital sinus and the anal cavity.In
the mean time, at an early period a depression occurs on the cutaneous
surface at the site of the anus, which deepens progressively until it
encounters the primitive intestine, with which it unites at the end of
the fourth week, and the continuity of the tube becomes established.It
therefore is seen that the rectum in its upper and middle portions is
derived from the internal and middle layers of the blastodermic
membrane, while its lower third, with the anus, like the buccal cavity,
is formed by the external and middle layers.In its diseases, then, the greater part of the rectum would seem to
naturally participate in those of the large intestine, to which it
structurally belongs, while its inferior portion and the anus would
partake more in the disorders of the general cutaneous system.This
peculiarity of development also explains the difference noticed in the
vascular supply.The rectal veins are usually divided, like the rectal
arteries, into three sets--superior, middle, and inferior.They are
arranged so as to form two distinct venous systems, the rectal
returning its blood through the inferior mesenteric veins into the
portal system, the anal terminating in the internal iliac.The first
system is made up of the superior hemorrhoidal, the second of the
remaining veins.The superior hemorrhoidal forms a venous plexus which surrounds the
{879} internal sphincter muscle; the inferior hemorrhoidal vein also
forms a plexus, but it is subcutaneous and principally below the
inferior border of the external sphincter.There are, however, a number of communicating branches passing along
the walls of the rectum from one plexus to the other.The internal
hemorrhoidal veins also communicate freely with the branches of the
internal iliac around the trigone of the urinary bladder by means of
small vessels, which pass through the prostate gland and seminal
vesicles.By this method of anastomosis some relief is afforded when
there is an obstruction in the portal circulation, which is such a
common cause of turgescence of these veins, often resulting in
permanent dilatation or hemorrhoids.At the lower part, or at the junction of the middle and lower third of
the rectum, the internal circular fibres of the muscular coat of the
intestine become quite numerous, forming what is called the internal
sphincter muscle; it is nearly an inch in breadth, and completely
surrounds the lowest part of the rectum.It is about an inch above the
margin of the anus; its muscular fibres are of the involuntary or
unstriped variety; in function it assists the external sphincter in
closing the anus and preventing the involuntary escape of the contents
of the bowel.The external sphincter lies directly under the skin and upon the
internal sphincter and the levator ani muscle; its fibres encircle the
anus: arising from the coccyx, they are inserted into the tendinous
centre of the perineum, joining the transversus perinaei, the levator
ani, and accelerator urinae muscles.The sphincter ani is constantly in
a state of tonic contraction, but the force of its contraction may be
voluntarily increased.In the skin and superficial fascia are found
minute branches of the pudic and small sciatic nerves; in the
ischio-rectal space the internal pudic nerve; crossing about the centre
are the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves, which are distributed to the anus
and the lower portion of the rectum; the perineal nerve is especially
distributed to the anterior part of the anus.Thus it is seen that the rectum and anus have vascular and nervous
supplies of considerable diversity and importance.The simplest form of congenital malformation in this region consists in
an anus of insufficient size for the natural demands of the system, but
in no other manner abnormal.The most frequent variety of imperforate
anus is where complete occlusion is effected by the common integument
or by two cutaneo-mucous flaps, which owing to defective development
remain united without forming a raphe or perceptible line of union.The
rectum is not involved, and when the child strains the contained
meconium causes bulging of the part, which disappears under slight
pressure, but reappears when again free.In other cases the occluding
tissue is very firm, dense, with a disposition to pucker or form rugae.The sphincter muscle is rarely perfect, and though an artificial anus
may be made, years may elapse before the child can control the
evacuation.In conjunction with an imperforate anus the colon may
terminate in a cul-de-sac, or it may communicate with the urethra, the
bladder, or the vagina.{880} An imperforate rectum has been known to discharge at the
umbilicus, upon the face, under the scapula, upon the penis or the
anterior part of the scrotum.Sometimes, though very rarely, a common
cloaca has been found, as in fowls, common to the rectum and to the
genito-urinary organs; and still more rarely the rectum has opened in
abnormal sites upon the perineum and upon the buttocks.The rectum may be entirely absent or
it may be incomplete, terminating at various distances from the anus.These malformations of the bowel may be associated with a perfect anus,
or with any of its imperforate forms, or with a fecal fistula.In
occlusion of the rectum the offending structure is in some cases a
hymen-like fold of mucous membrane, which, during straining, can be
recognized by the finger as a fluctuating protrusion; while in others
it consists of a mass of dense fibrous tissue which extends upward from
an inch to an inch and a half: in the former there is always found a
normal anus; in the latter there is either no trace of anus or one in a
more or less rudimentary state.In those cases where the rectum is
entirely absent the intestine terminates either in a cul-de-sac or a
fecal fistula; very rarely the rectum is replaced by a
fibro-ligamentous cord or band which springs from the colon, and,
descending toward the bladder, blends with the connective tissue of the
part.In the latter the pelvis is always in an imperfect state of
development, being much contracted in its lower diameters, and the anus
is absent; and Rokitansky and Curling lay stress upon the
non-development of the pelvis as a diagnostic guide in determining the
absence of the rectum.The passage of a sound into the bladder or
vagina is a procedure of some diagnostic value, as if its point
impinges directly against the sacrum it may be presumed that no rectum
exists.If the malformation is of such a character that the fecal
matter can find no exit, a train of symptoms ensues analogous to those
seen in the adult affected with intestinal obstruction: the infant
cries and is constantly restless, refuses food, vomits, the abdomen
distends, and death speedily ensues.A remarkable exception to this
rule was the case mentioned by Bodenhamer of a child with absence of
the rectum who was not operated on until three months after birth, and
who was apparently in perfect health.At the operation the intestine
was found three inches from the surface, and the child made a good
recovery.Although the statistics of this class of malformations are somewhat
contradictory and confusing, it is safe to state that more male than
female children are so afflicted.The prognosis in the large majority of these cases is grave, for unless
the operator can see or feel the fluctuating protrusion, or can
recognize it after a very slight exploratory incision, he is working
totally in the dark and in close proximity to the peritoneum.Hemorrhage, peritonitis, pelvic cellulitis, and septicaemia diminish
the chances for recovery.Indeed, the majority of these cases are
scarcely amenable to surgical treatment.{881} PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.Prolapse and Procidentia of Rectum and Anus.These conditions obtain most frequently at the two extremes of life,
infancy and senility, but have a very different causation in each.Prolapse of the bowel may be partial or complete--partial when a
portion of the mucous membrane is extruded, and complete when the
entire rectum appears outside the anal orifice.A predisposing cause in
infants is found in the mobility of the bowel--in the fact that it and
the sacrum are much less curved than in the adult, and the abdominal
viscera are more voluminous: this, associated with the undeveloped
state of the muscular system, causes the weight and strain to act
directly and forcibly upon the sphincters, and the extrusion takes
place.It is often excited by allowing children to sit for a length of
time upon the chamber-vessel.It is frequently caused among children by
the presence of vesical calculi, by Oxyuris vermicularis, diarrhoea,
constipation, dysentery, polypi, and by the long-continued acts of
coughing and crying.In adults and the aged it may be caused by loss of tone of the anus and
rectum in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, or from the energetic action
of drastic cathartics, by urinary calculi, the long-continued use of
enemata, chronic cough, diarrhoea alternating with constipation,
stricture of the urethra, prostatic hypertrophy, tenesmus due to the
presence of polypi, and by the pressure of a pelvic tumor.It may
accompany procidentia uteri and hemorrhoids.An incomplete, reducible
prolapse consists of two or more overlapping plications of
normal-looking mucous membrane, sensitive but painless.In these cases
there is provoked a hyperplasia of much-elongated connective tissue in
the submucous space which undergoes serous infiltration and causes an
oedematous condition of the part.In a complete prolapse the entire
rectum--all of its component layers--is protruded through the anus.In
a recent case the folds of the gut are well marked, but in one where
the bowel has remained in this abnormal condition for some time the
submucous tissue becomes charged with inflammatory deposit which
effaces the plications and causes the bowel to become pale, hard, dry,
and tough; and finally pigmentation occurs and the part assumes
somewhat the character of true skin.These vary greatly in size, from
the slightest protrusion of mucous membrane to a tumor the size of a
melon.Usually they are reduced with ease, but their reappearance is
occasioned by the slightest tenesmus.In old age the soft parts of the floor of the pelvis and the anal
sphincters lose to a great extent their tone and contractile vigor, and
the rectum, also participating in this change, is often unable to
withstand the increased thrust of the diaphragm and the compression of
the abdominal muscles during defecation; which act frequently demands
more exertion on account of a tendency to constipation in advanced
life.In these long-standing cases of senile procidentia it is a matter of
experience, verified by post-mortem dissection, that the fibres of the
sphincters and of the levatores ani muscles are flattened, pale, and
stretched beyond the possibility of contraction, while the entire
perineum is in a state of atrophy.{882} Polypi of the Rectum.There are two varieties of these--the gelatinoid or soft, and the
fibroid or firm.The latter is of rare, the former of common,
occurrence, especially in children under the age of twelve years.The
fibroid polypus is only found in adults, and is composed of dense
connective-tissue elements and blood-vessels.The gelatinoid or soft
polypi are also partly composed of connective tissue and vessels, but
much finer than in the other: they contain hypertrophied follicles and
are covered with spherical epithelium.They resemble nasal polypi, but
are more dense.These growths are not malignant in character, but are
very troublesome, as they are almost always pedunculated, the stem
being from half an inch to four inches in length, which admits of the
descent of the tumor within the grasp of the sphincters during
defecation, and frequently admits of its escape from the anus.Their
presence is not free from danger, as they are very vascular, bleed
readily, and are sometimes detached by the breaking of the pedicle
during defecation.The presence of
these abnormal growths teases the rectum and brings on tenesmus and
frequent desire to go to stool; the feces are flattened, and with them
escapes a quantity of glairy red mucus which has been compared to thin
currant-jelly.When caught in the grasp of the sphincters they often
bleed profusely, and especially is this the case with children so
affected.The presence of these bodies is accompanied with a sense of
weight and uneasiness in the bowel.They may be single or multiple;
they may be round, reniform, oval, fusiform, or irregular; they may be
smooth or villous.In size they vary from that of a marble or cherry to
that of a small hen's egg, and they are usually found about three
inches above the anus, but they vary in position from a point just
within the sphincter to one six inches up the rectum.Their presence is
usually diagnosticated without difficulty, or, if any is experienced, a
digital exploration will reveal them.A child with functional
disturbances of the bowels accompanied with frequent hemorrhages should
be examined for polypus.One of these growths sometimes unpleasantly
complicates a case of hemorrhoids.A rectal polypus is an adenoma, consisting of dilated glands of
Lieberkuhn imbedded in connective tissue, also containing nerves and
blood-vessels, and is covered with the epithelium of the bowel.Hemorrhoids, or Piles.These are usually fibrous when situated below, or vascular when
situated above, the sphincter ani muscle.They are conveniently known
as external and internal piles, but in some instances it is impossible
to say whether these tumors are external or internal.In either variety
they are due to an abnormal state of the blood-vessels, and especially
of the plexus of superior, middle, and inferior hemorrhoidal veins
disposed around the lower extremity of the rectum immediately above the
internal sphincter muscle.The inferior mesenteric and internal iliac
veins receive a large portion of the blood from this plexus, so that a
very free intercommunication exists, around the lower portion of the
rectum, between the general {883} venous system and that of the liver.It should be borne in mind that these veins are destitute of valves,
and are situated in a very dependent part, which is normally in a high
degree of functional activity.External hemorrhoids are found at the very verge of the anus, and, when
not irritated or inflamed, appear like movable, dependent plications of
hypertrophied skin.They appear either singly or in groups, but it is
nothing unusual to find five or six of them together, and they are not
infrequently associated with the internal variety.These pendulous tabs
of integument are very prone to inflammation, and they then become
exquisitely tender, painful tumors, which vary in size from that of a
small pea to that of a pigeon's egg.That portion of the tumor
presenting toward the anus is covered with mucous membrane; the other
is covered with integument; the former is dark-, due to
engorgement of its vessels.These, being composed internally of
tortuous, dilated veins which have totally lost their normal
resiliency, bleed freely on section, but after a time they undergo the
following changes: the over-distended vein, of which each is mainly
composed, either becomes obliterated by the encroachment of
inflammatory deposit or its walls give way and the contained blood
escapes; its serum is absorbed, and the tumor now consists of a
blood-clot, the remains of a vessel, inflammatory lymph, a hyperplasia
of connective tissue, mucous membrane, and integument.It undergoes a
still further change by absorption, and remains a permanent pendulous
teat of cutaneous and connective tissue, bearing no trace of vascular
channels.On account of the extremely sensitive nature of the mucous membrane and
skin of the anus, an inflamed condition of these tumors entails an
amount of suffering very disproportionate to their size: there is
torture in the act of defecation, constant tenesmus, spasm of the
sphincters, a sense of weight and heat in the perineum, and sometimes a
swollen, very painful, condition of the raphe, which stands out like a
cord.Occasionally there is a total inability to urinate, combined with a
frequent desire to do so.When an attack such as this ends in
suppuration of the tumor a radical cure is effected, but a marginal
ulcer of the anus sometimes follows.An unclean and neglectful habit
provoking constipation, sexual incontinence, over-indulgence in
highly-seasoned food or in stimulating beverages, exposure to cold and
wet, and the straining attendant upon dysuria, will provoke an attack.No age or sex is exempt from this affection (Gross).It is claimed that
before puberty females are more subject to it than males; after that
age the reverse obtains, except during pregnancy.Internal hemorrhoids are round, oval, or sometimes cylindroid-shaped
tumors covered by mucous membrane; they are smooth, granular, or rough
to the touch, much less sensitive and painful than the inflamed
external variety, and are situated within the rectum it may be an inch
or two above the internal sphincter muscle.They occur in groups or
scattered over the surface of the bowel.In structure they are soft,
spongy, vascular tumors composed of dilated and tortuous blood-vessels,
the veins predominating over the arteries, their interstices scantily
supplied with connective tissue, and their covering is of mucous
membrane.In color they are dark red, but when compressed and
strangulated by the sphincters they assume a dusky purple hue.After
long exposure they take on a pseudo-cutaneous appearance.{884} The columns of the rectum are the seat of the cylindroid pile,
which is brighter in color and much more arterial in its structure than
the ordinary variety, and bleeds very freely.Anything which causes
stasis and accumulation of blood in the hemorrhoidal plexus of veins
predisposes to this very common affection.Constipation is the usual
cause; and among others may be named diseases of the liver which cause
portal obstruction, pelvic tumors causing engorgement from pressure,
the gravid uterus, labor, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary calculi,
stricture of the urethra, stricture of the rectum, and rectal tumors.Among other causes are horseback-riding, the erect posture, violent
cathartics, seat-worms, dysentery, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and a
sedentary life, with a diet of rich, stimulating food.These piles do not usually cause much suffering; they vary in size from
that of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg, and cause a sense of weight
and stuffing in the bowel; but when they are large and numerous they
cause severe pain, tenesmus, difficult defecation, spasm of the
sphincters, and prolapse of the anus.When the patient is at stool the
tumors are forced down and protrude in a bunch, surrounded and
constricted by a collar of prolapsed mucous membrane: under these
circumstances the tortuous and dilated vessels of which they are
composed give way and free arterio-venous hemorrhage takes place.In
some cases this happens at every stool, the patient losing from a few
ounces to a half pint of blood almost daily until alarmingly depleted.Usually, the protruded piles are easily restored after a motion of the
bowels, and so remain until the next one occurs; but in other cases of
longer standing and of more gravity the sphincter loses all tone and
the piles remain constantly prolapsed.This affection is very chronic,
and the subject of it has to regulate his life with the greatest care,
as the least unusual effort or excess may provoke an exacerbation.Excepting in the worst cases the general health is not materially
impaired.They occasionally become so strangulated as to slough off,
which effects a cure, but this is accompanied by grave constitutional
disturbance.The disease is rather rare before the age of puberty, but
is very common in both sexes in adult life, and is frequently
associated with fistula, polypus, fissure, or carcinoma of this region.In females suffering with piles a free hemorrhage from them sometimes
takes the place of the menstrual flow.The presence of internal piles
causes a sense of weight and fulness and the sensation of a foreign
body or of feces remaining in the rectum, with troublesome and
obstinate itching about the anus.These symptoms, with the occurrence
of hemorrhage from the rupture, erosion, ulceration, or abrasion of the
dilated vessels, render the diagnosis easy.Should the piles not
protrude, they can readily be made to do so by directing the patient to
sit and strain over a vessel containing hot water.If the piles do not
appear, a digital examination should be made.Indeed, it would be
better to make one in every case of this kind.About the margin of the anus the superficial veins are prone to great
dilatation, and when presenting form masses of a bluish color, often
very dark, covered partly by mucous membrane, partly by integument.{885} Dilatation of the Rectal Pouches, or Physick's Encysted Rectum.This is an uncommon disease, generally occurring in those advanced in
years, and consists of an hypertrophy, and sometimes of an
inflammation, of the natural rectal sacs.These pouches are quite small
in early life, and enlarge gradually as age advances, this condition
being favored by the lodgment in them of extraneous substances, such as
indurated fecal matter, inspissated mucus, the seeds of fruit, and
other undigested masses.Constipation, so usual with the old,
predisposes to this affection, as it keeps the bowel distended with
hardened feces.The pouches vary much in size, the largest of them
admitting the end of a finger.The disease is insidious and slow, but
is capable of producing intense suffering should inflammation,
suppuration, or ulceration attack them.Sometimes as many as a dozen
are involved.The symptoms, which are rather misleading than suggestive of the
disorder, are a sensation of weight and uneasiness just within the anus
and uneasy sensations in the rectum, distressing itching, and, after a
time, pain following defecation and lasting often for hours.The pain,
which is aching and burning in character, is not confined to the parts
affected, but radiates down the thighs, toward the back, and into the
perineum.An increased secretion of mucus always exists in these cases,
but the discharge of purulent matter is uncommon, and its presence
indicates the existence of very active inflammation.It is said that even in the worst cases no spasm of the sphincters
occurs.An exploration of the bowel with a blunt-pointed hook affords
the only reliable guide to correct diagnosis: this, as it is moved
about in the rectum, engages the rim of a sac, which may thus be drawn
down through the anus and examined.Non-malignant Stricture of the Rectum.In the absence of ulceration or syphilitic infection this is an
uncommon disease, and very many of the cases of so-called stricture of
the rectum are caused by spasm which always disappears during
anaesthesia.The affection may be described as a narrowing of the lumen of the
rectum, more or less circumscribed, by the deposition of inflammatory
lymph or fibrous tissue in the mucous, submucous, or muscular tunic of
the bowel.It may be due to traumatic causes, such as the introduction
of foreign bodies, the frequent and careless use of enema-pipes, or the
presence of sharp or irritating substances swallowed, as pieces of
shell or bone.It is said to have been caused by indurated feces, but
no cases have been published in which this causation is clearly shown.This condition has also been brought about by various operations upon
the mucous coat of the bowel, such as the application of nitric acid
and other escharotics and the removal of portions of mucous membrane
and of hemorrhoids.Stricture may be secondary and a result of extension of an inflammation
outside the bowel, as pelvic cellulitis; and it is frequently caused by
syphilitic deposition and by chancroidal invasion--in the former by
{886} infiltration, ulceration, and cicatrization, in the latter by
unnatural sexual connection, or by infecting vaginal discharge running
into the bowel.When the stricture involves only the mucous tunic, it imparts to the
finger the sensation of a ring-like elevation or a valve-like
projection, into which the finger enters or beyond which it passes
usually without much difficulty; but when it involves the submucous and
muscular layers, as after the cicatrization of a large rectal ulcer,
the finger encounters a dense fibrous mass which in some cases appears
to have no lumen, but in others will admit only the end of the finger.In these grave cases of long standing there occurs considerable
dilatation of the rectum above the stricture due to fecal detention and
impaction at this point, and hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the
bowel produced by long-continued straining and expulsive efforts.Allingham[2] speaks of chronic constipation as a cause, and says,
"Straining to evacuate the contents of the bowel forces down the upper
part of the rectum into the lower, causing an intussusception; it gets
within the grasp of the sphincter muscles, and this may be the
starting-point of the irritation."Stricture does not usually follow
proctitis, even when the latter is very chronic.The long-continued
pressure of the child's head in cases of delayed labor is said to have
caused stricture of the rectum.[Footnote 2: _Diseases of the Rectum_, p.This affection is a disease of adult life, and more cases of it occur
among women than among men."If stricture of the rectum is found in a
young woman, it is probably due to chancre cicatrices; if it is met
with in old women and men, the inference should be that it is either
caused by cancer or by syphilitic infiltration and its consequences.Only in those cases in which no cicatricial tissue has been
formed--that is, when the contraction is due to the infiltration
alone--will the results of the antisyphilitic treatment contribute
anything toward rendering the diagnosis more certain."Stricture of the bowel may exist for months and years without being
recognized and without causing the patient much uneasiness; more
frequently, however, there is marked uneasiness, with an increased
desire to go to stool and a sense of weight or of a foreign body in the
bowel.It is given usually as
one of the most common and reliable symptoms of this condition that the
feces are flattened, ribbon-shaped, or triangular or wire-drawn: in
true stricture, according to Allingham, this is not the case, but the
characteristic stool consists of small, irregular, broken fecal
fragments.When the contents of the bowel happen to be watery, the
loose stool is spurted out with great force.In this disease diarrhoea
alternates with constipation; the intestines become distended with
quantities of gas and feces, which provoke frequent and severe attacks
of colic; the appetite and digestion fail; the complexion becomes
sallow; the patient emaciates; ulceration sets in, and the patient
slowly sinks from exhaustion.Usually, these cases do not give rise to
much pain, and what there is, is usually referred to the back, thighs,
penis, or perineum.A discharge of mucus resembling white of egg
immediately precedes each action of the bowels.Usually, these
strictures are within two and a half or three inches of the anus, but
sometimes they have been found high up in the sigmoid flexure, and
rarely at a greater distance.A syphilitic stricture by direct
inoculation {887} is found just within the sphincter muscle, and
consists of an infiltration of inflammatory lymph in a circumscribed
portion of the submucous tissue.It is tight, highly sensitive,
thickened, inflamed, and bathed in pus; there are also constitutional
symptoms, as fever, anorexia, and mental irritability.The subjects of
this variety are usually women.The tissues composing strictures of the
rectum of a very chronic character are found to be gray or bluish-white
in color, of very dense fibrous structure, and creaking under the knife
when cut, as a piece of cork would do.Besides the before-mentioned stricture, due to the contraction of a
chancroidal ulcer, is another caused by submucous gummata of the
ano-rectal region, which is very rare; and yet another, the diffuse
gumma, or ano-syphiloma of Fournier, which is the most frequent of all
causes of stricture of the rectum.The diffuse gumma is one of the
later manifestations of syphilis, and consists in "an infiltration of
the ano-rectal walls by a neoplasm of as yet undetermined structure
originally, but susceptible of degenerating into a retractile fibrous
tissue, and thus giving rise to narrowing of the intestinal calibre to
a greater or less extent."Proctitis, or Inflammation of the Rectum.Inflammation and suppuration in the lower part of the rectum are even
more common than the corresponding affections of the caecum, and their
causes are quite as various.In many cases, no doubt, this affection is
traceable to ulceration (perforative or otherwise) of the mucous
membrane; in others it probably originates in the connective tissue
which surrounds the rectum (periproctitis).The rectum, still more
frequently than the caecum, becomes involved in inflammation and
suppuration originating in the various pelvic, and even in distant,
organs.Abscesses arising in the abdominal cavity or its parietes are
peculiarly apt to gravitate into the pelvis and to communicate with the
rectum.Proctitis in its acute form has some symptoms in common with dysentery,
but it differs from it by the absence of abdominal pain, tenderness,
and severe constitutional symptoms.The pain in proctitis is usually
referred to the sacrum and perineum, and there is frequently dysuria
from sympathetic affection of the bladder.This disease may be acute or
chronic; the latter form occurs in those advanced in life.Frequent
attempts to evacuate the bowels, with great tenesmus, heat, weight, and
fulness in the bowel, and a mucous and bloody discharge in the absence
of impaction of the rectum, characterize the attack.Should it be
protracted and severe, the discharge will become purulent.A digital
exploration should always be made to ascertain if any foreign or
irritating substance is exciting the inflammation.The presence in large numbers of Oxyuris vermicularis may excite
irritation and inflammation of the rectal mucous membrane, which is
sometimes very intense.[3]

[Footnote 3: Curschmann, _Ziem.Inflammation of the anus and buttocks, caused by the application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation, has extended into the
{888} rectum and produced proctitis and peritonitis.[4] "In some cases
of dysentery the pathological lesions are limited to the rectum, which
would produce an apparently local inflammation very similar to
proctitis.The irritation of unnatural sexual intercourse and the
contact of gonorrhoeal poison have been known to excite intense
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the rectum, with a copious
discharge of pure pus, and accompanied by intense burning pain and
great heat of the parts involved."[5]

[Footnote 4: Case of Dunmire, _Philada.[Footnote 5: Heubner, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.Fissure of the Anus and Rectum.The painful ulcer of Allingham is quite a common affection, attacking
women more frequently than men, and no age is exempt from it.Of 4000
consecutive cases of rectal and anal disease observed by Allingham, 446
presented fissure of the rectum.Their usual
position is dorsal, although they may be found at any part of the
circumference of the anus, and just within the verge of the anus at the
junction of the skin and mucous membrane, extending upward toward the
rectum usually not more than half an inch, and appearing as a crack or
fissure, often very trifling in appearance, or a club-shaped
ulceration, the floor of which will be very red and inflamed if it is
recent, but if chronic the floor will be grayish, with hard,
well-defined margins.Sometimes there will be found at the external
extremity of the fissure a small club-shaped papilla or muco-cutaneous
polypoid growth; but this is not to be confounded with the ordinary
polypus, nor is it the cause of the fissure, but the result of
irritation caused by the latter.In other cases the external site of
the fissure is indicated by a very tender and swollen flap of
integument, which often becomes the seat of a small but very painful
fistula.The club-shaped papilla is said to indicate invariably the
existence of fissure.Fissure of the rectum is often associated with anteversion and
retroflexion of the womb.In many of these cases the fissure will heal
spontaneously when the malposition is rectified.However treated, the
result will not be satisfactory while the uterine trouble remains
uncorrected.Fissure is not infrequently caused by and accompanied with polypi: it
may be caused by any accident whereby the verge of the anus is torn or
superficially lacerated--by chronic diarrhoea, by violent expulsive,
straining efforts, as in labor, by the passage of very hard, dry
stools--and very frequently it is syphilitic in origin.The most
prominent symptom of this disease is pain, and this is very severe and
peculiar in character, coming on in most cases not during the act of
defecation, but twenty minutes to half an hour afterward, and is
preceded by a hot, burning, throbbing sensation at the anus: then comes
on spasmodic contraction of the sphincters, and the patient endures
agonizing pain, often for several hours, when relief is gradually
experienced, and no pain is felt until defecation again becomes
necessary.Now, it has been observed that in some cases where the local
lesion is very trifling the pain and spasm are intense and
long-continued; in other cases, where spasm and agonizing {889} pain
followed every act of defecation, no lesion of the anus or rectum could
be found.This led Dolbeau to consider the essence of fissure of the
anus neuralgic, and to define it as "a spasmodic neuralgia of the anus
with or without fissure."The mental depression is so much out of
proportion to the local disease that this may come within Curling's
observation, that "mental causes may produce local disease in the
rectum."Rodent, or Lupoid, Ulcer of the Rectum.This is, fortunately, a rare disease, and is peculiar and distinct from
any other form of ulceration in this region.It is not cancerous,
although bearing some resemblance to epithelioma.As it first appears
it is very like a syphilitic sore, and its situation and the character
of the pain might lead to the supposition that fissure existed.Rodent
ulcer is usually situated upon the mucous membrane, although it
occasionally invades the integument about the anus; its shape is
irregular, its edges sharp and well defined, and it does not undermine
the neighboring tissues.There is no induration about this sore, as
nature does not seem to attempt to limit it or to set up any reparative
action, and its surface is red and dry.It is very destructive, and seems to prefer mucous
membrane, although sometimes it destroys deeply.It does not cause
infiltration; it does not spread by the lymphatic system, forms no
secondary deposits, nor does it produce stricture.It may remain in a
quiescent state for some time, and a certain amount of cicatricial
tissue may form; but it never heals spontaneously, and an exacerbation
comes on which destroys in a very few hours the repair which may have
been the work of many days.This form of ulceration of the rectum is
usually considered incurable; the pain is intense, being compared to
that produced by hot iron, and of course being much aggravated by the
acts of defecation.Patients so affected die from exhaustion and pain,
although recovery may take place, I have known one case entirely cured
by complete excision.Spasm of the sphincters is a usual accompaniment,
and greatly augments the suffering of the patient.Of the four thousand
consecutive cases of rectal disease tabulated by Allingham, only two
were cases of rodent ulcer.This condition may be caused by foreign bodies introduced into the
anus, by indigestible substances swallowed, by impaction of feces, by
pressure of tumors external to the rectum, and by intestinal
concretions.Any condition which causes loss of muscular and nervous
tone in the large intestine favors its obstruction; thus, it is not
uncommon in the aged of both sexes, but especially is this the case in
women, and in them it often follows parturition.Hysterical, nervous,
and debilitated persons are particularly prone to it.The insane, if
not carefully watched and regulated, will become the subjects of it.Impaction of feces is a very common cause of obstruction of the rectum,
and atony of this organ is usually the primary cause, the feces in
these cases being {890} either very hard and dry or clayey and
tenacious.These masses are of a more or less globular shape, and, as
they irritate the bowel and produce diarrhoea, the practitioner
sometimes falls into the error of prescribing doses of opium and the
astringents, misled by the appearance of feculent fluid which oozes
around the impacting mass.The impaction occurs just above the internal
sphincter.Habitual constipation soon stretches the rectum and robs it
of expulsive force, and an accumulation of months of fecal matter is
sometimes found.The appearance of persons so affected suggests
malignant disease: they are cachectic, sallow, dyspeptic, irritable,
and nervous.Vomiting, anorexia, thirst, cough, hectic, irregular and
profuse sweating, are also among its symptoms.Cases of melancholia and
of hypochondriasis have been cured simply by the discovery and removal
of rectal impactions.This condition has been mistaken for cancer,
phthisis, intermittent fever, and enlarged mesenteric glands.Accompanying impaction, and as a result, is spasmodic contraction of
the sphincter ani, which causes the anus to protrude in a nipple shape
and to firmly resist the introduction of the finger.Usually, there is
no discharge from the anus in these cases.Tenesmus, a sense of weight
and of a body present in the bowel, are experienced.Young people are
not often subjects of impaction.Concretions also cause obstruction of the rectum: these are more
frequently cylindroid in shape, and sometimes have a nucleus consisting
of some firm foreign body.Wetherill reports a case of a young adult,
who had been accustomed to the daily ingestion of a substance known as
hygienic bread (this substance is made from the husks of grain, and is
very coarse: it is used to excite peristaltic action), from whose
rectum he removed a very hard ball of this substance which was covered
with mucus, but which contained no nucleus.He reports another case in
which the offending substance was a globular mass of casein, stained
with bile and covered with mucus, and which had for a nucleus a small
mass of hardened fecal matter.Gueneau de Mussy[6] reports a case in which there was an occlusion of
the rectum by a mass of magnesia, which was so firmly impacted that it
had to be removed by a mallet and chisel.A similar case occurred in
the practice of Dunlap of Norristown.Fendick[7] relates an instance of
impaction by a fish-bone near the anus, causing obstruction requiring
surgical interference; which illustrates the importance of examining
carefully all cases of acute piles and threatened abscess.[Footnote 6: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1879, vol.[Footnote 7: _Lancet_, 1880, vol.These concretions often consist of animal and vegetable fibres matted
together about a nucleus, the latter consisting of the seeds of fruit,
fragments of bone or gristle, hair, small coins, or pins."Enteroliths
may lodge in the rectal ampullae" and cause obstruction.Indigestible
substances swallowed with the food may be arrested in the rectum, such
as grape-skins, fruit-pits, husks, and fibres, and where there already
exists stenosis of the bowel a dangerous form of obstruction may be
produced.Jones[8] reports a case of chronic impaction of the rectum by
plum-stones, which gave rise to trouble in defecation, and at the end
of eighteen months produced symptoms of piles; at the end of two years
impaction occurred, and the mass was removed by the surgeon.Hazelhurst
relates {891} a case of impaction in a <DW64> where two hundred and
eighty plum-stones were removed from the rectum after having been there
for a week.The records of the Pennsylvania Hospital furnish the
following interesting case of obstruction:[9] "The patient (a male)
stated that twenty years before he swallowed a peach-stone.Two years
afterward he had symptoms of rectal irritation, tenesmus, constipation
alternating with diarrhoea, and liquid stools, etc.A digital
examination revealed a hard, stony mass two and a half inches above the
anus.Under ether Morton divided the external sphincter, and with a
pair of bone-forceps removed, with considerable difficulty, a
good-sized peach-stone which was lodged in the rectal tissues.The
stone was very sharp at the ends, and had evidently lodged crosswise
and become imbedded.The patient was discharged quite well and free
from all symptoms."[Footnote 8: _Lancet_, 1856, vol.[Footnote 9: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, Phila., 1880, p.Gall-stones may cause impaction or they may form the nuclei of
concretions.A case of impaction is related by Walker,[10] who removed
a gall-stone from the rectum which measured three and a half inches in
its longest and one and a quarter inches in its shortest diameter; also
one by Roberts,[11] in which he removed a gall-stone measuring five
inches in circumference from the rectum of a woman two weeks after
confinement.Mischievous, revengeful, insane, or intoxicated persons
sometimes force very curious foreign bodies into the rectum, among
which may be mentioned hot iron, bottles, cups, bougies, pieces of
wood, stones, a champagne flask, a goblet, slate-pencils, and the tail
of a pig with the bristles cut short.Some foreign bodies introduced
from below find their way through the sigmoid flexure and lodge in the
colon, or they may remain for a long time in the rectum.The caecum is
the favorite resting-place of foreign bodies.Turgis[12] removed by
linear rectotomy a cup which had been forced into the bowel.These
foreign substances, if not promptly removed, set up violent
inflammation.Obstruction of the rectum may be caused by vast numbers
of round- or thread-worms twining themselves together in a mass; and
when this happens in children or in adults of very nervous organization
a curious train of reflex symptoms may be developed, among which may be
mentioned choreic movements, convulsions, pruritus ani, insomnia,
irritability, melancholia, and hypochondriasis.Finally, the rectum may
be obstructed mechanically by pressure exerted from without.Such an
effect might be produced by morbid growths from the sacrum or ileum; by
deposits in Douglas' cul-de-sac; by ovarian disease; by pelvic
cellulitis causing stricture of the rectum; by vesical trouble; by
ascites with hepatic disease; and by various abnormalities of the
uterus, such as inflammation, morbid growths within or upon, simple
retroversion or retroflexion, or retroflexion of this organ in a gravid
state.[Footnote 10: Flint, _Prac.[Footnote 12: _Societe de Chirug._, 1878.]Impaction of feces under some circumstances may give rise to extensive
sphacelus of the rectum and the contiguous parts from pressure.This is
well illustrated in the following case of a woman aged sixty-five, who
was found to have an immense distension of the abdomen from ascites,
incident to a large omental scirrhus.The patient suffered greatly from
the pressure caused by the accumulation of water, and she was tapped.Soon after this an impaction of feces was observed, which probably had
been forming {892} for some time prior to her coming under observation.A week or ten days after the tapping the impaction was detected, but
not soon enough to prevent the formation of a large slough of the
posterior and inferior part of the rectum immediately above the anus.The submucous tissues and the skin, owing to the greatly enfeebled
condition of the patient, soon gave way, leaving a large opening which
communicated with the bowel.The tissues adjacent were oedematous, red,
and painful.The finger carried into the bowel through the anus
discovered the slough to have involved a region of at least two and a
half inches in diameter.Cutaneous Eruptions and Parasitic Conditions of the Anus.These are quite numerous, and they almost invariably produce much
distress and excite painful pruritus, which is augmented rather than
relieved by scratching or friction of any sort.The application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation is capable of exciting
considerable inflammation upon and around the anus, accompanied by
small pearly vesicles, which, when ruptured by scratching, seem to
spread the disease wherever the contained serum flows.Eczema, when
found in the anal region, is usually due to parasitic growth.Erythema
intertrigo is caused by the friction of moist opposing surfaces, as
between the nates of stout persons, who perspire freely, and infants.The abraded derma exudes a sero-purulent fluid which excites
troublesome pruritus.When this condition exists about the anus it
causes painful defecation and spasm of the sphincters.Erythema
chronicum occurring in this locality is frequently a sequel to chronic
eczema and chronic lichen: the skin cracks, is moist, thickens, and the
epidermis exfoliates.The proximate cause in both of these conditions
is congestion of the vascular rete of the derma.In prurigo podicis
papules appear which itch intensely, and when scratched bleed, the
summit of each papule bearing a small black scab.If not cured, in time
a true psoriasis may develop.Herpes of the anus occurs similar to
herpes at the other mucous outlets of the body, and is usually
symptomatic of slight disorder of digestion.Wetherill has seen a case
of herpes zoster, (var.proserpens,) in which the vesicles extended
from the side of the scrotum along the perineum to the verge of the
anus.This condition was accompanied with neuralgia of the rectum,
painful defecation, and spasm of the sphincters.Furunculi sometimes
form at the verge of the anus, causing spasm, pain at stool, and
occasionally marginal fistulae.Various syphilodermata also appear in
this region.Gross was the first to describe a condition of trichiasis
of the anus--a very irritating complication to fissure--due to a
perverted recurvation of the hairs usually found in the anal region.Villerme states that hairs have been found growing from the mucous
membrane of the rectum.The colonization of pediculus pubis about the
anus occasions a certain amount of irritation.Sarcoptes hominis is
sometimes found in this region, having been carried there by hands
infested with this parasite.The
peculiar tracks or burrows made by this little animal, and the use of
the microscope, make the diagnosis certain.The Acarus autumnalis, or
mower's mite, has been found in the skin of this part, and it is
capable of causing great distress.These do not furrow the {893}
integument longitudinally, but burrow vertically, and may be picked out
of the summits of the wheals, where they appear as small red points.Ulceration of the Rectum and Anus.This is a condition very different from fissure or the painful ulcer of
Allingham--much more grave, difficult to treat, and, in chronic cases,
much less hopeful of cure.It is not an uncommon affection, Allingham's
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus
furnishing 190 of the disease under consideration.An ulcer of the
rectum may be partly within, partly without, the internal sphincter,
but in most instances is found above that muscle, from an inch and a
half to two inches from the anus, situated dorsally.The symptoms are unfortunately obscure and insidious, misleading not
only the patient, but also too frequently his medical adviser, and
gaining grave headway before a correct diagnosis is reached.Often the
very first symptom is a slight diarrhoea every morning as soon as the
patient rises, accompanied with a little discharge resembling
coffee-grounds; or, again, the discharge is like the white of an egg;
in some rare instances pus is formed.At this stage there is little or
no pain, but the patient suffers from tenesmus--which is not followed
by relief--and a sense of uneasiness in the part.Several stools of
this nature or streaked with blood may be passed during the earlier
part of the day, after which the patient feels partly relieved, and no
more evacuations occur until the following morning, when he again
experiences the same train of symptoms; and this repeats itself daily
for a long time.Finally, these discharges occur in the evening as well
as in the morning, then at various times during the day: his general
health begins to give way; the discharge becomes augmented in amount
and contains more blood and pus; and he suffers occasional pain from
flatulent distension.Local pain in the rectum is now felt, which is
not acute, but is very wearying, is augmented by much walking or by
long standing, and which has been described as similar to a dull
toothache.These ulcers may be multiple, and not infrequently lead to
stricture of the rectum, which condition is indicated by the
alternation of attacks of diarrhoea and constipation.As the ulcerative
process proceeds, nature makes efforts to limit the process, which
causes infiltration and thickening of the submucous and muscular
tissues, and produces narrowing of the lumen of the intestine, which in
time loses its tone and contractile power and becomes a passive tube,
utterly unfit to perform its normal duties.The sphincters give way and
the patient loses control over his evacuations.Finally, abscesses
form, which, burrowing toward the surface, form fistulae, and may
perforate the bladder, the vagina, or the peritoneal cavity.If one of
these ulcers be examined while yet in the acute stage, it will be found
to be oval in shape, with well-defined edges: the base will be either
grayish or very red and inflamed, the surrounding mucous membrane
appearing normal.The rectal glands will be found to be enlarged.Should the ulcer be examined at a later stage, it will be found to be
much deeper and more extensive, with great thickening and nodulation of
the mucous membrane, and looking in places as though the latter {894}
had been torn off.At this stage the ulceration may be partial or may
involve the entire lower portion of the rectum.The suffering is now
intense, and a constant discharge of fetid pus and mucus takes place.The appearance of the anus at this time suggests malignant disease: it
is covered with swollen, shiny, tender, club-shaped flaps of integument
constantly bathed in an ichorous discharge.The entire rectum and
sigmoid flexure have been involved in some cases, while in others
necrosis of the sacrum has occurred.Patients suffering from ulceration
and stricture are very liable to a low form of peritonitis, attended by
intense abdominal pain.The causation of these ulcers of the rectum is frequently very obscure:
some are of syphilitic, others of strumous, origin.Some are of
traumatic origin, but more often the patient was in apparent health up
to the time of the appearance of the disease.The experience of
Allingham would indicate that neither chronic constipation nor
dysentery is a frequent forerunner of this malady.T. Claye Shaw,[13]
in an article entitled "On Some Intestinal Lesions of the Insane,"
says: "After death are found patches of ulceration sometimes so
extensive as to resemble a honeycomb network.The edges are usually
slightly raised, and perhaps hardened; but the ulcers are at other
times mere local punchings out of the mucous membrane, and there is
often a little loose gelatinous material."It is claimed that such
disorders are not infrequent among the insane.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, 1880.]It is also claimed that the chronic mechanical irritation from foreign
bodies, impacted feces, and the like exert a causative influence in the
formation of ulcer of the rectum.Like typhlitis, this affection leads
to chronic inflammatory changes in the immediate neighborhood
(periproctitis), with the formation of fistulae and crater-shaped
ulcerations, and to the extensive destruction of the mucous membrane,
followed by wasting and contraction of the rectum.The healing of these
ulcers is much delayed by the fact that the ulcerated and undermined
mucous membrane is irritated by the fecal masses which are especially
apt to accumulate in the lower part of the bowel and around the anus.We find also hemorrhoidal swelling and ulcerations, which may be
regarded as partly a cause, partly a result, of the ulcerative
proctitis.In this condition the most extensive ravages are found in the rectum
and sigmoid flexure.The causes are identical with those of catarrh of
the large intestine, if we except the follicular disease produced by
dysenteric infection.In this form of the disease, at least in its
earlier stage, the form of these ulcers is always round and
funnel-shaped, with distinct thickening of the edges of the mucous
membrane around the ulcers.These appearances may be explained by the
mode in which the follicular ulcerations originate: "The solitary
follicles become swollen, a result of catarrhal irritation, and the
cellular elements accumulate in the reticulum, giving rise at first to
nodules which project above the level of the mucous membrane: then the
newly-formed tissue-elements become necrosed in consequence of the
mutual pressure of the cells upon {895} each other; finally, the apices
of the follicular nodules give way and the ulcers are formed.The
surrounding mucous membrane bends over downward toward the base of the
ulcer, so that the orifices of the crypts look down into the same."[14]
As the suppurative process extends, particularly in the submucosa, and
the tissue surrounding the follicles becomes destroyed, these small
ulcers coalesce to form larger ones, and the undermined edges of the
mucous membrane project over the base of the ulcers, bleed, and become
necrosed.Healing is possible by cicatrization, the borders of mucous
membrane becoming applied to the base of the ulcer and gradually drawn
together by the cicatricial tissue.Still, this result is extremely
rare if the ulcerative process has gained much headway.When, however,
a follicular ulcer of some size does heal, cicatricial stenosis may
result, followed by chronic constipation, just as in the case of simple
catarrhal ulceration.The situation of follicular ulcerations is almost
always in the large intestine, and they vary considerably in number:
sometimes only a few follicles are thus affected, while in other cases
the bowel is crowded with them.[Footnote 14: Rokitansky, _Path.The anus and rectum may become the seat of chancroidal invasion.An
ulcer of this character fairly within the rectum is very rarely met
with, especially in this country, and could scarcely be produced except
by unnatural intercourse.They are of not uncommon occurrence in the
anal region, and are met with in this situation more frequently among
females than among males.Occurring among the former, they no doubt
often arise from accidental contact during normal sexual intercourse.When this condition is found in males, it rather indicates at least an
attempt at unnatural intercourse.Of 1271 males affected with
chancroids, only 3 were found with the disease in the anal region.Out
of 388 females similarly affected, 33 were found with chancroid of the
verge of the anus.The table of Debauge gives 23 cases among 206
females having chancroid in various other situations.The destruction
of tissue in these cases may be very serious should the nature of the
ulcer not be recognized, and stricture of the rectum or cicatricial
stenosis of the anus might result.Ulceration of the rectum may occur
during chronic proctitis; it may accompany advanced states of prolapse
and procidentia of the bowel; it may attack a stricture of the rectum
and cause peritonitis by erosion.Ulceration may accompany hemorrhoids,
or it may attack them and cause dangerous hemorrhage.Finally, a very
intractable form of ulceration may follow the clamp-and-cautery
operation upon piles.When this untoward result is seen, it is usually
due to the fact that the patient has been allowed to move about too
soon.Allingham claims to have seen these ulcerated stumps of piles
even ten days after operation.Peri-anal and Peri-rectal Abscess.The ischio-rectal fossa is peculiarly liable to attacks of inflammation
resulting in abscess, as it is filled with much loose connective tissue
which supports a considerable amount of fat, and is situated in a
region which is constantly exposed to injury both from within and
without.It is a very vascular part, being freely supplied by branches
of the inferior {896} hemorrhoidal arteries and veins; the latter,
being large and destitute of valves, empty into the portal circulation.Abscess in this region is of very common occurrence, and may attack any
one at any period of life.It occurs more frequently among men than
among women, and usually during middle life.Abscesses in this situation may be acute or chronic.The former variety
may be caused by injury to the anus or to the surrounding parts; by
exposure to cold and wet, and particularly by sitting upon damp seats
while the body is overheated; by impaction of feces, constipation, and
straining at stool.Irritating substances swallowed with the food, such
as small pieces of bone, oyster-shell, or the stones of fruit, may
excite abscess by their presence in the rectum.Among other causes are
general debility, an impoverished state of the blood, the scrofulous
and tuberculous diatheses.The disease sometimes occurs in quite young
infants.Wetherill reports the case of an infant attacked by an
enormous ischio-rectal abscess while nursing from the mother, who was
at the time suffering from a succession of boils.Many cases have been
traced to sitting upon the outside of damp omnibuses.Hepatic
disorders, causing engorgement and stasis of the blood in the
hemorrhoidal plexus, have frequently occasioned this condition.These
abscesses are not always situated in the ischio-rectal fossa;
frequently they are subcutaneous and just outside the anus: in other
cases the starting-point may be ulceration of the mucous membrane of
the rectum, with escape of fecal matter into the areolar tissue; they
also originate in the submucous connective tissue of the rectum.The
acute abscess is sudden and very severe in its onset; the pain is
continuous, throbbing, and augmented during defecation; dysuria is
almost always present, and in some cases there is total inability to
pass water.There is local tenderness, dusky redness, and fluctuating
prominence, and, if not interfered with, a rupture of the integument
will take place and the pus will escape externally.Sometimes their
formation is accompanied with a chill or with a succession of rigors:
there is always considerable constitutional disturbance, febrile
movement, loss of appetite, and malaise.This form of abscess is
usually circumscribed and does not burrow irregularly, and sudden
relief of pain and distress is coincident with their evacuation.Chronic rectal abscess corresponds to the cold or chronic abscess in
other situations: it is apt to occur among those who are much
debilitated or among those of the scrofulous diathesis.These abscesses
have little disposition to open spontaneously upon the surface, but
they burrow extensively in all other directions--high up along the
outside of the rectum, laterally into the tissues of the buttock, or
downward and forward into the perineum.The process of formation may
occupy many months, and sad havoc may be occasioned before their
existence is suspected.They occasion no pain nor distress nor acute
febrile movement, but may be accompanied with a hectic condition,
erratic sweatings, and rapid loss of strength.Upon examination of the
anal region in these cases a painless flat, boggy, crepitating
enlargement is the only surface-indication of the probably extensive
damage sustained by the deeper structures.This form of abscess may be of traumatic origin, but more frequently
the inflammatory process arises in the cellular tissue of the
ischio-rectal fossa; in some cases the morbid action is due to
ulceration of the rectum.{897} In either case peri-rectal or peri-anal
cellulitis will be induced.When these abscesses are of strumous origin
the pus is thin, curdy, and offensive.Both the acute and the chronic abscesses of this region are often
difficult to heal, the external opening remaining permanently patulous,
communication with the bowel resulting from internal burrowing and
erosion, with the formation of extensive sinuses in all directions,
resulting in fistulae in ano.This condition occurs more frequently than any other of the
abnormalities of this region, Mr.Allingham finding 1208 out of his
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus.He
found also that fistulae followed rectal abscess in 151 out of 196
cases, the abscesses which healed kindly and gave no further trouble
being only 45 in number.A fistula in ano is a linear ulceration with a
patulous orifice which discharges pus: it may or may not communicate
with the bowel, and it may have more than one external opening.The
great majority of fistulae in this region are caused by abscess, either
arising in the submucous areolar tissue of the bowel, or in the
subcutaneous connective tissue in the immediate neighborhood of the
anus, or in the ischio-rectal fossa, or in an ulcerated state of the
mucous membrane of the rectum: in other cases it is congenital, or it
may result from the presence of foreign bodies or worms in the bowel,
or from puncture of the rectum by pins, scales of shell, fragments of
bone, or other sharp substances swallowed with the food.Abscesses
leading to fistulae have followed kicks, blows, or wounds of the anal
region: in short, anything which induces an abscess here may result in
a fistula, and as in the former more cases occur in males than females,
and more during middle age than at any other period, the same is true
as to the latter.Fistula is quite common among the phthisical as a
result of malnutrition and septicaemia, aided by the constant
succussion of the perineum produced by efforts at coughing.Of the 4000
cases previously referred to, 1208 were cases of fistula; "of these,
172 presented more or less marked symptoms of lung trouble,
haemoptysis, cough, or impaired resonance in some portion of the
chest."To be complete, it must have
two openings (it may have more)--one in the anus or rectum, and one
upon the surface.There are two forms of the incomplete or blind
fistula--one in which there exists an internal but no external opening,
and the other in which there is an external but no internal opening.In
complete fistula there may be more than one external opening, and this
is in the majority of cases not far from the anus, but it may open in
the perineum or upon any part of the gluteal region.When the openings
are multiple they usually converge to form a common tract or sinus.The
external opening presents nothing to the untutored eye to lead to the
suspicion of grave internal trouble: frequently the vent is so minute
and valvular or shielded by a thin pellicle as to be entirely
overlooked; in other cases a little teat formed of superabundant
granulations guards the entrance: there may or may not be
discoloration, elevation, or depression of the surrounding integument,
and erythema resulting from the {898} irritating nature of the
discharge.Inflamed and suppurating follicles in the integument about
the anus are not to be mistaken for the orifices of fistulous tracts.The internal opening in anal fistula is situated between the sphincter
muscles, sometimes just within the anus, but oftener about half an inch
above; in rectal fistula the internal opening or openings may be at any
point above the internal sphincter.These sinuses may be very tortuous,
with pockets, blind passages, or diverticulae, and are known as
horseshoe fistulae when they commence at one side of the bowel and
ulcerate around it to a point opposite before making an opening.Of the two varieties of incomplete fistulae, by far the least frequent
is that where no internal opening exists, but where there are one or
more external orifices: these do not invariably even run toward the
bowel, but may extend off through the tissues in any direction.In the
other variety, where there exists no external evidence of disease,
considerable damage may be done before its recognition.Fistula may
coexist with hemorrhoids, stricture, ulcer, or malignant growth: it may
be a very trivial affair, with the internal but a fraction of an inch
from the external opening, or it may be long, deep, and tortuous, with
sinuses running in all directions through the buttock.Usually, fistulae become worse when not operated upon, but there are
cases which have healed without surgical interference--others in which
this condition has gone on for many years without getting any worse or
without the discharge increasing in amount.The fluid discharged from a
chronic fistula loses after a time much of its purulent character and
becomes serous and watery; but fresh abscess and inflammation is apt to
take place in these cases from feculent matter lodging in the sinus.Those which burrow most readily are the internal fistulae with large
openings, into which the feces are pushed, with the sinus running
toward the anus, because of their funnel-shape.The presence of fistula may be suspected if there are in the anal
region abscesses which have not completely healed, or which, having
apparently done so, break out from time to time and discharge pus; or
from the existence of a circumscribed hardness or swelling
unaccompanied by an opening which varies in size and is at times
painful; or if there exist any ulcerated moist openings.To make a
positive diagnosis the tract must be explored by a probe: enter the
oiled, blunt-pointed probe gently into the external opening and let it
find its way along without force, bending the probe if necessary, until
it has traversed the sinus as far as it will go; then pass the finger
into the rectum and feel about for an internal opening or for the point
of the probe.If the finger be introduced first, the relations of the
parts are interfered with and the internal opening, should one exist,
might not readily be found.Sometimes the bottom of the tract does not
correspond in situation to the internal opening, but extends beyond it.In those cases where no external opening exists, the rectal speculum,
aided by judicious pressure, will discover an issue of pus from a sinus
upon the mucous membrane of the rectum.In order to illustrate the amount of damage which a small foreign body
may cause when lodged in the rectum, Wetherill relates the following
case, which occurred in his practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital for
the Insane: The patient was a middle-aged man, intelligent, and an
{899} employe of the hospital."Upon examination of the anal region I
found a small, tender, firm swelling, which did not fluctuate, about an
inch to the left of the anus: this had been forming for about a week,
and there was no history of painful defecation, of exposure to damp and
cold, nor of a blow or injury of the part.Without waiting for the
development of fluctuation, I made a free and deep incision into the
ischio-rectal space, and a large quantity of very fetid pus escaped:
upon introducing a large probe I found that it passed up into the fossa
to a depth of four and a quarter inches and turned but slightly toward
the bowel.Remembering the experience of Allingham, that when the pus
in these cases was very offensive there existed an opening in the
bowel, I questioned the patient again as to pain in the bowel or
painful defecation, which was answered in the negative.No
communication could be found with the finger in the bowel and a probe
in the wound, and poultices were applied, liquid diet ordered, and the
man kept in bed.The cavity was loosely filled with absorbent cotton
and the entire wound (apparently) healed slowly, but kindly, and in
about ten days after operation the patient left the house to all
appearance sound.About a week after the patient returned with the
report that he felt uneasy throbbing in the part, and that there was a
very slight discharge.Upon inspection I found in the surface-line of
the cicatrix a pinhole opening which yielded upon pressure a drop or
two of pus; upon entering a very fine probe it passed into a narrow
sinus to a depth of three and a quarter inches, but no communication
could be made with it with the finger in the bowel.Upon withdrawing
the probe it grated over something which felt like dead bone, about two
inches from the surface.I enlarged the opening, introduced a pair of
fine dressing-forceps, and withdrew a piece of the rib of a chicken
about half an inch in length and sharpened at one extremity to a fine
point.Upon making inquiry I found that he had not eaten any chicken
since the development of the abscess.He then suddenly remembered that
while he was at stool a few days prior to the formation of the abscess
he experienced a sudden pang of very acute pain in the rectum, which,
however, soon passed off.This was no doubt the moment when the piece
of chicken-bone pierced the rectum."Hemorrhage from the Rectum.Hemorrhage from the rectum may be accidental, primary, or
secondary--accidental when it follows the ulceration of internal piles
or the erosion of large arterial or venous trunks during the progress
of malignant disease, or when it occurs from the rupture of a rectum
during defecation--a very rare and curious occurrence reported by M. E.
Quenu;[15] primary when it occurs during, and secondary when it occurs
after, a surgical operation upon these parts.[Footnote 15: _Revue de Chirurg.Hemorrhage from the rectum without any structural lesions is quite
unusual, but occasionally copious losses of blood are seen in vicarious
menstruation, and several instances have been reported.When ligatures separate after operations upon those of broken-down
constitution very copious and dangerous bleeding may occur without any
symptoms save a "sensation of something trickling in the bowel," {900}
a feeling of weight and fulness in the part, with increasing weakness
and syncope of the patient, until he expresses a desire to go to stool,
when suddenly a large quantity of blood escapes.SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.This class of affections depends upon constitutional infection, direct
extension of disease by contiguity, by contiguity from disease in
neighboring organs, or by abnormal conditions excited by disease of
remote origin; and are frequently due to changes in the nervous and
vascular supply.Syphilis of the Rectum and Anus.True primary syphilitic chancre of the rectum must be an extremely rare
lesion, and could have been acquired only by unnatural intercourse.There are syphilographers who deny that the hard chancre has ever been
found within the sphincter muscles; but it certainly is not uncommonly
found in the anal region, and oftener among women than men.The table
of Jullien gives 12 instances of this lesion in males, and 1 instance
of chancre of the buttock, out of 77 cases, while among 82 cases
occurring in the opposite sex, 21 were of the anus and perineum and 4
of the buttocks.The French authorities give the frequency of this
condition in men as 1 case in every 119; in women, 1 case in every 12.Anal chancres are easily overlooked, as they occupy the puckered folds
of the anus, which when not opened out to the fullest extent afford
perfect concealment: they may be either in the form of cracks or slight
fissures, elongated ulcerations, or firm papules.It has been claimed
that the initial lesion has provoked stricture of the rectum, but this
is not probable.The secondary manifestations of this disease which show themselves in
the anal region are some of the syphilodermata, moist papules, mucous
patches, and moist papillomatous excrescences or condylomata.The
statistical tables of Davasse and Deville[16] in regard to the
occurrence of moist papules and mucous patches in women show that out
of 186 cases they appeared about the anus in 59 and on the perineum in
40.Bassereau's[17] statistics show that in men these lesions occurred
in the anal region 110 times out of 130 cases.These are, of course,
very contagious.Besides true syphilitic warts, which sometimes occur
in this region, it is quite usual to see the anus surrounded and the
entire gluteal cleft filled up with moist, offensive, papillomatous
excrescences, which remain obstinately so long as these surfaces are
permitted to rest in moist contact.Syphilitic stricture of the rectum
is one of the results of a later stage of infection, and occurs oftener
among women than men.It is stated by Jullien that of 60 cases only 7
were men, the remaining 53 women.They are invariably formed as
follows: A gummatous deposit in the {901} submucosa undergoes
ulceration, and the subsequent cicatricial contraction gives rise to
the stricture.Whether the stricture will be valvular or annular
depends upon the extent of rectal mucous membrane involved in the
ulcerative process.The diffuse gummatous infiltration of the
ano-rectal tissues and the subsequent deposition of contractile tissue
are the most usual causes of these specific strictures.The lower
portion of the rectum is commonly the situation of specific
ulcerations, usually of the secondary or tertiary stage, which lead to
the formation of stricture: this occurs more frequently among women
than men, and between the ages of seventeen and thirty years.Gosselin
and Mason regard strictures as the result of chancres, and not as the
result of constitutional infection; but it is known that ulcerations of
secondary syphilis may extend upward from affections about the anus,
and also that gummata do commonly give origin to this condition.Gummata, and strictures following them, may be distinguished from other
affections on account of the greater distance from the anus at which
they occur, chancres or chancroid ulcers being usually within four or
five centimeters of the anal orifice.Strictures due to gummata are
more apt to occur late in life, but may therefore be easily confounded
with cancer.Condylomata at the anus are often associated with
syphilitic disease of the rectum.cit._]


Scrofulous and Tuberculous Affections.There are cases which yield abundant evidence of struma in the form of
enlarged glands, chronic abscess in the neck, swelling and abscess in
the vicinity of the articulations, and the like, in which ulceration of
the mucous membrane of the rectum has been found: this condition may
result in fistula in ano by erosion, permitting escape of flatus and
excrementitious products into the cellular tissue.A similar result may
follow by erosion of the bowel from a strumous abscess in the
connective tissue around the rectum; both these forms tend to the
production of that class of fistula which has no outlet at the surface,
but which has one or more openings upon the mucous membrane of the
rectum.Thus concealed (for often there is no marked surface indication
of either abscess or fistula), they may remain for a long time
unsuspected and acting as a serious drain upon the already impaired
constitution.The pus in these cases is watery, curdy, and offensive.These chronic conditions are subject to intercurrent attacks of acute
inflammation, due to the lodgment in the abscess cavity or the
fistulous tract of fecal matter or indigestible solid substances.Any
or all of the abnormalities of this region may be complicated by the
existence of tubercular or scrofulous conditions of the system.Tubercular ulceration of the rectum is now a well-recognized condition.Rectal ulceration and tubercular disease of the lungs have not been
found to coexist in any marked preponderating number of tabulated
cases.The frequent association of fistula in ano and tubercular
disease of the lungs has long been recognized, Allingham having found
172 such cases among 1208 cases of fistula in ano.The pathology of tubercular ulceration of the rectum is graphically
described in _Ziemssen's Encyclopaedia_ as follows: "These
[ulcerations] begin in the follicular apparatus with swelling of the
individual {902} follicles and their vicinity from tuberculous deposit.The newly-formed cells become caseous, the superficial layer of the
tubercle breaks down, and thus ulcerations arise of a round funnel
shape.The enlargement of these ulcerations is probably produced by the
constant formation in the base and edges of the ulcers of new nodules,
which themselves caseate and ulcerate.This process of extension, to
which these tuberculous ulcerations of the intestines exhibit a marked
tendency, takes place chiefly in a transverse direction (girdle-shape),
following the direction of the blood-vessels.The infiltration and
necrosis may advance longitudinally, and, finally, the individual
ulcerations coalesce with each other: in this way may be explained in
part the dentate appearance of the edges of these ulcerations.The
ulceration extends also in depth, although usually the muscular coat
appears to be covered by a thick layer of connective tissue: the
destruction advances slowly in the muscularis, but in the lymphatic
vessels which pierce the muscularis less opposition is presented to the
progress of the tuberculosis; and thus it is not uncommon to find
tubercles ranged one after the other, like links in a chain, from the
base of the ulcer directly down to the serosa.The most frequent situation is the lower end of the ileum, but
the process may extend upward to the stomach, or downward, involving
the rectum.There is almost invariably unmistakable signs of
tuberculosis in other organs.It is possibly never primary, but this is
a still-disputed point.It usually occurs with tuberculosis of the
lungs, and when so occurring it is always secondary.The clinical
symptoms of this state are by no means characteristic."Dwelling upon the subject of intestinal tubercle, it has been suggested
by Klebs[18] that the intestinal disease is produced by swallowing
morbid products derived from phthisical lungs--an hypothesis supported
also by the fact that tubercle in the intestines tends so strongly to
spread downward."The seat of the deposit is the submucous tissue or
the corium of the mucous membrane: it is certainly subjacent to the
basement membrane, and not contained in the follicles, as Creswell
taught."[Footnote 18: Jones and Sieveking, London, pp.Woodward, in his article upon diarrhoea,[19] says: "The lesions,
whether mild or severe, are most generally seated in the caecum and
colon, but more or less extensive tracts of the small intestine,
especially of the ileum, are often involved also."He continues:
"Tubercular disease of the lung was noted in nearly one-sixth of the
autopsies of fatal cases of forms of flux heretofore described.Possibly the frequency in chronic cases may be explained by the fact
that protracted intestinal flux forms the development of lung phthisis
in the predisposed."History of the War of the Rebellion_, p.The rectal fissure or painful ulcer may be connected with diathetic
causes, as struma or scrofula: it is doubtful if syphilis should be
included among its causes.Cancer, Malignant Stricture, and Malignant Ulceration.The forms of cancer met with in these regions are epitheliomatous,
scirrhous, encephaloid, and colloid.Considerable diversity of opinion
has {903} existed as to which variety occurs most frequently; but it is
now probably a matter of absolute knowledge that the epithelial form is
the one most commonly observed, and next to that in frequency the
scirrhous form.Encephaloid and colloid are of quite infrequent
occurrence.Again, as to the sex in which this affection appears the
most often, there is much disparity existing between surgical writers:
it is usually thought to be much more prevalent among women than among
men.This is not the experience of many of the authorities upon this
subject, yet the statistics of the Hotel Dieu, Paris, furnish
overwhelming evidence in favor of its preponderance in women.Carcinoma
of the rectum, occurring as a primary infiltration in the rectum,
probably occurs oftener in men, but there are among females so many
contiguous structures prone to cancerous degenerations, as the uterus,
the vagina, the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, tumors and cancerous
masses occupying Douglas's cul-de-sac, that it would seem likely that
they would be more frequently the victims of secondary cancerous
deposit in the bowel or of erosion and extension of disease by
contiguity or continuity.Epithelioma in other situations attacks men
much more frequently than women.This form of disease usually occurs in
middle life and in old age, but to this general rule there have been
many exceptions; it has been seen in children.Allingham quotes its
occurrence in a lad of seventeen, and Gowland in one of thirteen.It
very rarely occurs as a secondary deposit of cancer in a remote region
or organ.In the table of 4000 cases of rectal and anal disease, before
referred to, cancer existed in 105.This disease is usually within easy
reach of the finger, except when the growth is in the sigmoid flexure,
being within an inch or two of the anus or from two and a half to three
inches above it.The epithelial form, when it commences at the anus, is
closely analogous to epithelioma of the lip: from the anal outlet it
spreads upward into the bowel, or it may be primarily seated there.When occupying the junction of skin with mucous membrane it is
sometimes sluggish, and a long time may elapse before it takes on
aggressive action: induration, nodulation, obstinate fissure, or
fungous growth marks its inception; as the condition proceeds,
infiltration of surrounding structures takes place and large, hard,
irregular masses form, which ulcerate, split, and form cauliflower
excrescences.The rectum becomes blocked with fungoid growths: both
these and the cancer proper are very vascular, and frequent hemorrhages
occur, and an offensive muco-purulent discharge constantly oozes from
the bowel.Scirrhus of the rectum commences as an infiltration of the submucosa,
which rapidly involves the other elements of the bowel, pushing hard
nodules upward into the lumen of the intestinal tube: these break down
and form ragged ulcers with indurated margins, and bleed profusely.Its
situation is usually not higher than three inches above the anus.It
has a tendency to invade all the neighboring organs and soft
structures, to bind them to itself in a firm, dense mass, and to form
communications with the vagina, bladder, uterus, perineum, and penis.Abscesses and fistulae are common complications.These neoplasms are insidious in their onset, and when seated at some
little distance from the anus do not excite much pain at first.In the
epithelial form the anus presents an abnormal appearance: it is
inflamed and is covered with irritated, hypertrophied tags of
integument bathed in {904} a sanious, offensive fluid.Difficult
defecation, of which the natural form is absent, with inordinate
tenesmus, a sense of weight and fulness in the bowel, and an irritable
condition of the bladder, are among the symptoms.The feces are passed
in little, irregular lumps or broken fragments, or this state is
accompanied by or alternates with small, liquid, offensive stools.As
the diseased action proceeds, very severe local and general pain is
endured: this is of a dull, lancinating character, and affects not only
the diseased bowel, but involves the entire contents of the pelvis,
shoots down the thighs, up the back, and into the penis: frequent and
exhausting hemorrhages take place; the patient exhales a peculiar
sickening odor; his complexion becomes cachectic; his strength fails;
and death ensues, after a variable period of intense suffering, from a
few months to two or three years after the first symptoms appeared.The
modes of termination of life in these cases are--exhaustion, secondary
deposition, septicaemia, peritonitis, and hemorrhage.Stricture of the
bowel and very extensive ulceration attend all of these advanced cases
of malignant rectal disease.The encephaloid variety is prone to very sudden and rapid breaking
down, and may destroy life within a few months.If the finger be passed
into the bowel in a case of encephaloid degeneration, it will encounter
a large soft tumor occluding the gut: this is a very different
sensation from that imparted to the finger in a case of epithelioma or
scirrhus.In the former there will be felt a crepitating, as though due
to the giving way of a moist, friable substance; in the latter the
touch will perceive dense, irregular nodulations and ragged ulcerations
having very firm margins.The rectum may also be involved and destroyed by any of these neoplasms
in neighboring organs.A middle-aged woman who was admitted to the
Pennsylvania Hospital in a very advanced stage of epithelioma of the
cervix uteri died from hemorrhage from the rectum and uterus in eight
minutes.At the autopsy it was found that the disease had almost
separated the cervix from the body of the uterus, had involved the
cul-de-sac of Douglas, and had eroded a large opening into the rectum.Numerous ends of large vessels were observed which had undergone
erosion.Carcinoma of distant organs does not seem to frequently involve the
rectum by secondary deposition."In 160 cases of gastric cancer
examined at the Pathological Institution in Prague, Dittrich found
secondary cancer of the rectum only twice."[20]

[Footnote 20: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.In these cases of carcinomatous disease originating in the bowel the
neighboring lymphatic glands are indurated and enlarged, and secondary
deposition in neighboring and distant organs is the rule.The lower portion of the intestinal tract may become involved in
disease by direct extension from the colon, as in dysentery following
enteritis or entero-colitis.Habersham says that diarrhoea arises
generally from an irritated condition of the large intestine, catarrhal
and mucous diarrhoea from slight inflammatory disease closely allied to
ordinary coryza affecting the mucous membrane of the large intestine."In the diarrhoea of soldiers the lesions of the large intestine have
been either those of congestion with varying degree of extravasation or
of ulceration more or less extensive.The colon in the former cases has
invariably presented {905} patches of intense congestion, and in
numerous instances extravasation, the amount and intensity varying in
different subjects, in a few the whole mucous surface of the intestine
having a livid red color; in others tracts of more or less intense
congestion at irregular intervals, as in the small intestines, would be
noticed.The ileo-caecal valve almost invariably presented intense
congestion.The rectum has uniformly presented intense congestion, with
more or less fibrinous exudation.Frequently the presence of fibrinous
exudation was a question of doubt."[21] The entero-colitis or ordinary
summer complaint of infants not infrequently causes a very troublesome
form of proctitis.Besides the ordinary causes of dysentery, Feyrer[22]
states that it is caused by irritation of the solar plexus of nerves,
also by the inhalation of sewer emanations and by the ingestion of
impure water.History of the War of the Rebellion_,
vol.[Footnote 22: _Times and Gazette_, 1881, p."In dysentery the anus becomes bluish-red, and is even marked with
cracks and rents; it is painful to the touch and tightly contracted.In
the later stages of severe cases it becomes large and gaping; then the
stools are generally discharged unconsciously, and the pain is slight,
paralysis of the sphincter ani having occurred.These symptoms indicate
generally that death is to be expected.In some of these cases the
pathological lesions are limited to the rectum.Dysentery may succeed
typhoid fever."[23]

[Footnote 23: Heubner, _Ziemssen_, vol."Pigmentation is common after dysentery, and also after typhoid fever
when dysentery has existed.Pigment-deposits are encountered in the
large intestine in those who have suffered from repeated attacks of
acute diarrhoea or from protracted flux.They may be seated as diffuse
patches on the general surface of the mucous membrane or may be more
especially localized in the closed glands.The diffuse form of these
deposits is more frequently encountered in the large than in the small
intestine, and is apt to be more intense in the former, producing
darker and more extensive discoloration; hence the ash- and
slate-, greenish, and blackish tracts which are so frequently
observed in the caecum, colon, and rectum."[24] Follicular ulceration
of the rectum sometimes follows chronic dysentery and typhoid fever.Woodward has observed that a catarrhal condition of the rectum commonly
occurs in typhoid fever cases.Referring to typhoid fever lesions of
the large intestine, Rokitansky[25] says: "The ulcerative process is by
no means confined to the small intestine; we have seen the mucous
membrane of the large intestine riddled with ulcers.They were many of
them of large size, and had clean-cut, non-thickened margins.This
condition, indicating the absence of reparative action, is not nearly
so frequent as that of thickening and induration, which generally took
place to some extent in the edges of the ulcers.The bottoms of the
ulcers are commonly formed by the submucous tissue.Sometimes the
muscular fibres are completely exposed: this, however, is generally the
result of secondary advance subsequent to the reception of the morbid
action."[Footnote 25: Jones and Sieveking, p.John Harley[26] calls attention to the intestinal lesions of scarlatina
as follows: "I know of no disease in which the morbid effects are more
{906} uniform.Scarlatina is essentially a disease of the lymphatic
system.It is attended with inflammatory action of this system of
glands, in which are included the agminated glands of the intestine.In
28 cases examined, 8 had the solitary glands of the large intestine
enlarged and inflamed; in 1 there was acute desquamation of the mucous
membrane of nearly the whole of the large intestine.In about half the
cases the large intestine was found healthy."[Footnote 26: _Med.-Chir.The rectum and anus are frequently subject to attacks, by contiguity,
from diseases in neighboring organs.The most frequent of these is
doubtless that form of ischio-rectal abscess which invades the bowel,
causing fistula in ano.Various neoplasms having their seat in the
tissues or organs near the bowel may obstruct it by simple mechanical
pressure, or may cause inflammation, infiltration, and ulcerative
erosion.Mechanical encroachment by the pressure of a foreign body in
the vagina may cause grave interference with the normal functions of
the lower bowel.At the out-patient department of the Pennsylvania
Hospital in 1880, Arthur V. Meigs, assisted by Wetherill, removed a
large, hollow, glass ball-pessary from the upper end of the vagina of
an aged woman, who declared the pessary had been so placed by a
physician sixteen years before, and had remained ever since, despite
her repeated efforts to remove it with an ordinary table-fork.Upon its
extraction, which was accomplished with difficulty, a small portion of
its surface was found covered with scratches.Its presence had caused
constipation, impaction of feces, and atony of the rectum.Interference with the rectal functions often follows tedious cases of
labor where the child's head remains long in the perineum.The Effect of Abnormal Conditions of the Spinal Cord and its Membranes
upon the Rectum and Anus."In diseases of the spinal cord and its envelopes there is a great
tendency to constipation, owing to impairment of the secretion of the
intestinal juices.The intestinal movements are usually much affected,
either in the way of increase or diminution, in the former of which the
symptom is a frequent, watery, slimy diarrhoea; as a less common
condition it is even capable of being produced reflexly.Thus in a
patient with chronic myelitis I observed the regular evacuation of a
mucous fluid mass from the intestine as often as his bed-sores were
cleansed; and the like has been seen in dogs after division of the
lumbar cord.Much more commonly there is habitual, even excessively
obstinate, constipation, of which almost all chronic spinal patients
complain.The stool is slowly discharged, dry and hard, and the
evacuation occurs only at considerable intervals and after the
application of energetic remedies.Several causes doubtless contribute
to this: diminution of intestinal secretion and peristaltic
contraction, and probably also weakness of the abdominal muscles of
compression, which is often present.If there is an extreme degree of
weakness, meteorism and accumulation of feces are other consequences.We do not know exactly from what portions of the cord these
disturbances proceed."[27]

[Footnote 27: Erb, _Ziemssen's Encyc._, xiii.{907} "There are also in many diseases of the cord disturbances of
evacuation caused by paresis or paralysis of the sphincter ani.In mild
cases simple difficulty in retaining stool for any length of time
exists.There may be also great disturbance of sensibility, so that the
patient does not feel the call, and even if he possess some voluntary
control, he is surprised by the discharge, of which he feels
nothing."[28]

[Footnote 28: Erb, _loc.The sphincter ani is affected in cases of myelitis, the usual symptoms
being those of paralysis; the same is true in softening of the cord or
myelo-malacia, and there is also diminished reflex excitability of the
anus.Paralysis of the bladder and rectum is often delayed in cases of slow
compression of the cord; but if the compression exists to any
considerable extent, involuntary discharges of urine and feces will be
sure to occur.A pressure-myelitis of the lumbar portion of the cord
causes paralysis of the bowel, and in the later stage of some cases of
bulbar paralysis it also occurs.Early in the course of spinal meningitis there exists a spasmodic
condition of the sphincters: these muscles are also paralyzed in spinal
and in meningeal hemorrhage, and from the pressure of tumors upon the
cord giving rise to paraplegia."In acute ascending paralysis the
bladder and rectum are generally quite undisturbed in their functions.In hemiplegia and in hemi-paraplegia specialis disturbances in the
evacuation of the bladder and bowels are almost always present, and in
the acute traumatic cases it is especially common to find severe
paralytic symptoms at the beginning of the attack (complete retention
or complete incontinence, involuntary stools, etc.), which, however,
generally soon recede and give place to lighter, more permanent
trouble, as weakness of the sphincters."[29]

[Footnote 29: Ibid., _loc.The following is an extract from Gower's _Diagnosis and Diseases of the
Spinal Cord_:[30] "The spinal cord possesses centres, situated in the
lumbar enlargement, which preside over the action of the bladder and
rectum.They are probably complex reflex centres: that for the
sphincter ani is the more simple.... But if the volitional path in the
cord is damaged above the lumbar centres, the will can no longer
influence the reflex processes: as soon as the feces irritate the
rectum they are expelled by the reflex mechanism.... If the damage to
the cord involves also the sensory tract, the patient is unconscious of
this process; if the sensory tract is unaffected, the patient is aware
of the action of the bladder or bowel, but cannot control it.It is
often said that there is permanent relaxation of the sphincters, but
this is true only when the lumbar centres are inactive or destroyed.In
this condition evacuation occurs as soon as feces or urine enter; the
urine escapes continuously instead of being expelled at intervals....
We may, however, distinguish between the two states of the rectum by
the introduction of the finger: if the lumbar centre is inactive, there
is a momentary contraction due to local stimulation of the sphincter,
and then permanent relaxation.If, however, the reflex centre and motor
nerves from it are intact, the introduction of the finger is followed
first by relaxation, and then by gentle, firm, tonic contraction."[Footnote 30: London, 1880, p.{908} Morton has at this time in his wards at the Pennsylvania Hospital
two cases of rectal paresis following fracture of the vertebrae.The
first, a lad aged nineteen years, while crossing the Atlantic was
struck during a gale by a spar upon the back about the region of the
lower dorsal vertebrae.From the deformity and from other symptoms
there was undoubtedly a fracture destructive to the normal functions of
the cord.Upon the arrival of the steamer, some ten days after the
accident, the lad was brought to the hospital, where he has remained
for the past eighteen months.Total palsy of sensation and motion has
continued from the time of the accident to the present day, and extends
from the navel downward: the sphincter ani is constantly but feebly
contracted; the finger, when pressed into the anus, encounters slight
resistance, which continues during and after the simple passage of the
finger; very slight pressure, however, against the sphincter causes a
very marked relaxation, which continues so long as this is kept up.With the removal of the finger the sphincter slowly and fairly
contracts.The second case is also one of vertebral fracture which has
been in the hospital about ten months.In this instance the sphincter
is always found contracted, but it readily yields under finger
pressure, and contracts quickly and regularly in the absence of this
pressure.Constipation and rectal impaction readily occur, and the
bowel requires to be regularly emptied.In another case, at the
Episcopal Hospital, under the care of W. B. Hopkins, there is fracture
of the spine, with total palsy below the seat of injury.The margins of
the anus were found in apposition, but in no firm contraction: mere
contact of the finger appeared to have little or no effect, but slight
pressure upon the sphincter caused a contraction, and very moderate
pressure upon the anus after the introduction of the finger produced
excessive dilatation.The action of the sphincter was in all respects
very tardy.Two recent cases (August, 1883) of fracture of the dorsal vertebrae
have been admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospital.One, a lad aged ten
years, was struck by a bale of cotton which fell upon him; the other, a
man aged thirty years, fell from a second-story window.In both cases
total palsy occurred at once upon the receipt of injury, and in each
the same conditions of the anus have obtained as before described.In the convulsive attacks incident to epilepsy the sphincters of the
bowel and urinary bladder are relaxed and the discharges are
involuntary; probably, also, one of the first symptoms indicative of
tumor of the base of the brain is recognized in involuntary rectal
evacuations.Rectal incontinence may be also due to tabes, while atony
and constipation are sometimes noticed as a result of excessive
intellectual exertion (DaCosta).The same may be said of chronic
lesions of the brain and spinal cord.Paresis of the rectum has been
noticed as a result of chronic congestions of the heart and in hepatic
disease.Allingham has observed failing nerve-power as a cause of
rectal atony: the latter, with constipation, is one of the commonest
troubles attendant upon melancholia and the chronic forms of insanity.Seeley of Ovid, New York, related to Morton a case of paraplegia with
rectal paresis and dysenteric symptoms from malarial poisoning in a
married lady aged thirty years.An examination revealed an immense
rectal impaction.A free administration of quinia was followed by
complete recovery in a few weeks.{909} Spasm or Spasmodic Contraction of the Rectum and Anus.Apart from those cases in which spasm is induced by the irritating
stools of diarrhoea and dysentery, or by local ulcerations, fissures of
the anus, and intestinal worms, there are those in which painful spasm
occurs, due to the presence of a vesical calculus: it is also caused by
urethral stricture, impaction of feces, irritations and inflammations
involving the bladder or the adjacent organs.Spasm is also seen in
nervous females, without constipation; also in the varied irritations
of the female genito-urinary apparatus.In cases where spasm is due to
rectal impaction retraction of the anus is frequently seen.This most painful, distressing, and obstinate affection belongs to the
class of neuroses, and is simply functional in character, without the
least structural change in the skin or mucous membrane of the anus or
rectum: the itching may be confined to the former or it may extend into
the latter.It may be brought about by a constipated state of the
bowels, but it is more often due to derangements of the digestive
apparatus.Sufferers from pruritus ani are generally dyspeptics, although the
malady is observed in persons who are otherwise in most robust health.Overwork, mental and physical exhaustion, have been charged with
producing pruritus, and in some instances spinal irritation seems to
have been unquestionably the exciting cause: now and again, pruritus
ani has been produced by the pregnant condition, and in some cases this
malady has persisted during the entire period of utero-gestation.Intestinal worms, uterine maladies, rheumatism, and especially gout,
have unquestionably been exciting causes.Some years since a gentleman
having the most intense pruritus, which defied all treatment, was
suddenly relieved of all former distressing symptoms by the passage of
a small vesical calculus, the presence of which had never been
suspected, as no vesical symptoms had at any time existed.Some of the
most aggravated instances of anal pruritus are found in those far
advanced in diabetes mellitus.The nerves of the lumbar plexus in rare
instances have suffered from compression, more or less severe, from
fecal accumulations; in one case of spinal curvature detailed by
Portal[31] the rectum at its upper part was so narrowed by the
encroachment of the false ribs that excessive fecal accumulation
occurred which gave rise to remote pain in the great toe.[Footnote 31: _Cours d'Anatomie medicale_, tome iv.It seems to be unquestionable that there are instances of pure
neuralgia of the rectum, for in such cases the most carefully conducted
explorations have failed in demonstrating any evidences of disease.The
pain is doubtless reflex, due to depressing causes, to atmospheric
conditions, or to exposure to cold and wet.Neuralgia of the rectum has
also been noticed in malarial {910} poisoning, and especially in those
who have long been victims of intermittent fever.Neuralgia in this
region of the body is also due to general causes, as witnessed in cases
of rheumatism and of the gouty diathesis.Patients now and again
complain of "violent and painful pressure in the rectum, conjoined with
active pains in the perineum and anus and in the sexual parts: these
symptoms probably have a neuralgic character."[32] In many nervous
disorders, but especially in spinal irritations or inflammation, the
rectum is invaded by pains of a neuralgic nature more or less severe,
which are undoubtedly only functional in character.But 12 cases of
neuralgia were observed out of 4000 cases of rectal disease.Anstie[33]
says: "It needs some very powerful irritant to set up neuralgia in any
portion of the alimentary canal:... this condition has been described
by Ashton.... In one case the patient complained of acute, paroxysmal,
cutting pain extending about an inch within the rectum.... The cause of
this attack was his getting chilled from sitting in his wet clothes."Curling says that constantly directing the mind to this part of the
body will excite congestion and disease, possibly by producing abnormal
sensations, itching, and superficial inflammation.[Footnote 32: Erb, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.[Footnote 33: _Neuralgia and its Counterfeits_, p."In patients with piles hyperaemia of the spinal cord may become
habitual, returning regularly and frequently, and this may lead by
degrees to severer disturbance by the development of chronic
inflammation and proliferation."[34] Among some of the reflex troubles
arising from rectal disease are--sterility in women, simulation of
uterine disease, pruritus ani, pseudo-sciatica, pains in the legs and
feet, and impairment of co-ordination in the muscles of defecation.There is a case reported[35] of a curious pain in the sole of a foot
caused by rectal disease; and another[36] in which irritation of the
eyes was caused by hemorrhoids.[Footnote 34: _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.Times and Gazette_, 1868, vol.[Footnote 36: Cooper, _Lancet_, 1862, i. p.There are some cases occasionally met with of so-called irritable
rectum.Now, a rectum may be irritable because irritated, but in some
of these instances there is no apparent cause.There occur frequent,
small stools expelled with force, but without pain: there must be
abnormal peristaltic action to cause this condition.The Effects of Cholera and of Certain Poisons and Remedies upon the
Rectum.After death from cholera there is found congestion and a swollen state
of the mucous membrane of the rectum: in some cases the epithelium of
the entire alimentary canal is almost absent.In slow poisoning by
arsenic the bowels show ulceration, but more particularly the rectum.After phosphorus-poisoning the large intestine has been found inflamed
and contracted to the calibre of a quill.Among the effects of copper
have been seen ulceration and a peculiar green staining of the rectum;
of lead, no marked change of the mucous membrane except, in some
instances, hardening, but the muscularis was in an advanced state of
hardening and contraction.The action of croton oil is to render the
mucosa very soft and friable.Extensive destruction of the mucous
membrane of the rectum has resulted {911} from poisoning by bichromate
of potassium.The mineral acids and the caustic alkalies, when not
immediately fatal, cause corrosive ulceration of the rectum; the
soluble salts of zinc, tin, bismuth, and antimony produce a like
effect.Corrosive sublimate in its action upon the large intestine
produces a dysenteric condition; similar in their effects are
colocynth, jalap, elaterium, and cantharides.Strychnia causes a deep
violet congestion; alcohol, congestion and thickening; and tobacco,
redness of the mucous membrane with great engorgement of the vessels of
the rectum.One of the results of the long-continued abuse of morphia
is a catarrhal condition of the large intestine, accompanied with
exfoliation of the intestinal epithelium.Some persons are very
susceptible to the action of jaborandi, and in such its exhibition is
followed by hyperaesthesia and dull pain in the rectum and the urethra.It is interesting to note that an abnormal condition in the rectum may
cause extensive disease in a remote organ; thus, a stricture of the
rectum may cause abscess in the liver.Wilkes[37] exhibited at the
Pathological Society a specimen in which an abscess, a diffuse,
purulent infiltration of the liver, and a gall-bladder filled with
purulent bile were distinctly traceable to the suppuration arising from
an ulcerating stricture of the rectum consisting of dense fibrous
tissue situated about four inches from the anus of a man aged
thirty-seven years."Any form of suppurative intestinal disease seems
capable of producing hepatic abscesses of a metastatic or pyaemic
character."[38] It has not been found, however, that tubercular
ulceration of the intestines has ever given rise to hepatic abscess.[Footnote 38: Darley, _On the Liver_, 1883, p.Examinations and explorations of the abdominal viscera by the hand
introduced into the rectum, having for their object the detection of
tumors or morbid growths, are procedures which have fallen into merited
disrepute, and are mentioned here in condemnation.However, some years
since, Morton, in consultation with (J. Forsythe) Meigs, satisfactorily
demonstrated the absence of a suspected renal calculus by this method.The distension of the rectum with water, either free or contained in a
rubber bag, in order to facilitate operations upon the pelvic viscera,
has been lately brought into notice by Garson at a meeting of the
British Medical Association.The most significant point brought out at
the meeting was that the water-distended rectum displaced the distended
urinary bladder upward and forward until it occupied a position quite
outside of the pelvic cavity, carrying along with it the peritoneum
both in front and behind.By this method of distension it was found
possible so to raise the peritoneum in front of the bladder as to leave
a clear working space of four centimeters between the upper border of
the symphysis pubis and the edge of the peritoneum: this may prove
useful in suprapubic lithotomy, as well as in operations upon the
uterus and its appendages during laparotomy.RESUME OF THE THERAPEUTICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENT.FISSURE OF THE ANUS, in its true sense, is not to be confounded with
ulcerations either slight and superficial in extent, or with more grave
ulcerations involving not only the anus, but the mucous membrane of the
{912} rectum also.The true fissure is a mere linear crack or abrasion
or superficial ulceration.The pain accompanying this condition is out
of proportion to the length and depth of the fissure, varying from
slight uneasiness to as severe suffering as that caused by a deep and
extensive ulceration.The treatment to be adopted in such cases is first to regulate the
bowels and to insist upon a scrupulous cleansing of the part after each
evacuation.Much sitting is to be avoided and a sedentary mode of life
is to be discouraged.Sometimes a few light topical applications of the
solid nitrate of silver will bring about a cure, or a lotion of the
same of the strength of from two to ten grains to the ounce of water
should be applied with a camel's-hair brush every other morning.The
ointment of the oxide of zinc, combined with any of the local
anaesthetics, will be found useful.As a dernier ressort in obstinate
cases an incision should be made through the fissure, together with a
thorough dilatation of the anal sphincter.ULCER OF THE RECTUM, OR THE GRAVER FORM OF FISSURE OF THE ANUS.--In the
milder forms of this very common and painful affection the treatment
consists in thorough cleanliness of the part; the ulcerated surface may
be cauterized with nitrate of silver, and subsequently the application
of the red precipitate ointment or the lotio nigra.Should a vaginal
discharge exist, treatment should be instituted with a view to its
arrest, as the irritating fluid coming in contact with the ulcer would
prevent its healing.The treatment of that variety of ulceration where
the disease is situated partly without the anus and partly within the
rectum, besides the use of the means enumerated above, embraces the
daily introduction of a full-sized bougie made of wax or of yellow
soap.Henry Hartshorne says: "Experience leads me to have especial
confidence in collodion, to which one-fiftieth of glycerin has been
added to lessen its constricting effect."Glycerite of tannin and
tinct.J. C. Peters[39] recommends the
use of iodoform suppositories.Tarnier[40] dusts the part with the same
drug in fine powder.Crequy[41] has had success with a dressing of
charpie saturated in a solution of hydrate of chloral.For the more
extensive and obstinate forms of ulceration the three methods of
treatment mainly relied on are--by cauterization, by dilatation, and by
incision.The caustics usually relied upon are the fuming nitric acid
and the acid nitrate of mercury, one application of either of these
often exciting healthy granulation.This application is to be followed
by the use of an ointment consisting of thirty grains of calomel and
three grains of morphia to one ounce of lard.If there is much spasm of
the sphincters, extract of belladonna may be added.[42] During this
treatment the bowels should be kept rather loose by the use of compound
licorice powder, and if much pain is experienced an opium suppository
should be used.Dilatation, first practised by Recamier, consists of
the introduction of the thumbs of the operator into the rectum, placing
them back to back, and then forcibly separating them from each other
until the sides of the bowel can be stretched out as far as the
tuberosities of the ischia.On account of the fact that both
cauterization and dilatation are not infrequently followed by relapse,
the method of operation which includes both incision and dilatation can
usually be relied {913} upon.The bowels should be thoroughly emptied
by a laxative, and an enema should be given three hours before the
operation.[Footnote 41: Ashton, _On the Rectum_, p.[Footnote 42: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.After full anaesthesia the ulcer may be readily exposed.The left index
finger of the operator is then carried into the rectum, and a
sharp-pointed curved bistoury is entered, three-quarters of an inch or
more from the side of the anus, to the depth of an inch or less, and
carried on toward the bowel until the point is felt by the finger
within, when it is made to puncture the mucous membrane, and then to
cut out to the surface.In some cases of deep fissure, before dividing
the sphincter the ulcer may be scraped freely or the entire ulcer may
be removed.The anus should now be well dilated with the fingers, after
which an opium suppository should be introduced and a fragment of lint
or linen well oiled be placed in the wound.The subsequent treatment
consists in keeping the patient in a recumbent position and confining
the bowels with opium.After three or four days a laxative may be
given.No dressing is necessary save attention to cleanliness.The subcutaneous division of the sphincter has been proposed, but is
objected to on account of the liability of the extravasated blood
retained in the very loose cellular tissue of the part to form abscess.In one case which Morton operated upon in this manner many years ago a
large abscess formed very rapidly, with serious constitutional
symptoms, which were relieved only after the freest opening and
division of the sphincter.Should any polypi be found, their removal by ligation or by the knife
is an essential element of success in the operation; retention of urine
is not infrequent after operations upon fissure.When fissure or
ulceration makes its appearance in a syphilitic subject, it will
usually disappear under appropriate constitutional treatment.TUBERCULOUS ULCER OF THE ANUS is best treated by the topical use of a
weak solution of chloral hydrate.CHRONIC ULCER OF THE RECTUM.--In this condition the treatment should
include the use of anodyne and astringent lotions, suppositories or
enemata, and the internal administration of Ward's paste--_i.e._
confection of black pepper.RODENT ULCER OF RECTUM.--In this rather rare, exceeding painful, and
generally incurable malady the patient sometimes dies merely from the
exhaustion of pain.Another mode of death is by diarrhoea; another by
hemorrhage.To quote Allingham:[43] "I have really nothing to offer as
regards treatment; all the various sedatives will be required in their
turn, and in the earlier stage I should recommend excision--not that I
have much hope that you will eradicate the malady, but you will remove
the pain, and for some time the sufferer will be comparatively
comfortable.I think also the application of fuming nitric acid should
be tried with the same object; one of my patients was fairly easy for
three months after I had destroyed the ulcer with the acid."Morton
accomplished the permanent healing of an undoubted rodent ulcer of the
rectum by the complete divulsion of all the involved tissues.CANCER OF THE RECTUM.--The medical treatment of this affection is
necessarily restricted to efforts to alleviate suffering and to obtain
sleep--anodynes in the form of suppositories of pil.hyoscyamus in the proportion of a half
grain of the {914} salt to ten grains of the extract.Enemata of warm
water are useful.D'Arpene of Elba has suggested enemata of gastric
juice.The profuse discharge of sanious pus must be met by weak
injection of sulphate of copper and opium or a very dilute solution of
chloride of zinc.Now, as to the use of bougies in these cases, it may
be laid down as a general rule that their employment may be
mischievous, yet in certain cases justifiable--indeed, absolutely
necessary.When the disease is met with in its early stage, has not
ulcerated, is within reach of the finger, and is producing much
contraction of the calibre of the gut, a gum-elastic bougie, thoroughly
lubricated, may be introduced through the contraction.In case this
produces much suffering, the attempt must be abandoned; if not, once or
twice a week is often enough.Where no extensive ulceration exists the
patient can be much helped by this procedure.F. N. Otis[44] has
reported a case of malignant stricture in which he completely divided
the recto-vaginal septum, sphincter ani, and perineum with great
temporary relief to his patient.When large portions of a malignant
mass protrude from the anus, they may be removed by the application of
a paste of arsenite of copper or by the elastic ligature, the
destruction being safe and rapid.The injection of acetic acid into
these growths has been practised, but is useless and harmful.As to operative procedure, when the morbid growth is an epithelioma
situated within a short distance of the anal opening an excision is not
only justifiable, but may be recommended.The results show that its
removal from this situation is as frequently successful as is its
removal from the lip.When a cancer completely fills the lumen of the
gut and plugs it so that the act of defecation becomes impossible,
excision of the rectum and the establishment of an artificial anus are
the two operative procedures open to the choice of the surgeon.A
decided reaction of opinion has lately taken place among members of the
profession relative to the latter of these; the few surgeons who did
practise excision of the rectum in cases of cancer were looked upon as
being rather unscientific and unsurgical.Billroth has excised the
rectum 16 times, with 4 fatal cases; Dieffenbach performed it 30 times;
Lisfranc had recourse to this operation as early as 1826; while the
operation has been performed very frequently in this country, and with
success.Morton says: "In the spring of 1882, I was consulted in the case of a
lady aged fifty-six who had suffered for two years from what were
supposed to be internal hemorrhoids.An examination revealed the
existence of a large scirrhous mass encircling about two-thirds of the
gut, on the anterior part especially, and extending upward three
inches.The patient was worn down by long suffering, but was otherwise
in fair condition of health.With the assistance of Gross and Agnew, I
excised the mass, which included the entire lower part of the rectum.The wound healed kindly, without an untoward symptom, and the patient
was very soon enabled to leave her home for the seaside, where she
passed the summer.The disease, however, resumed, but without any of
the severe pains which she had had prior to the operation.Death
occurred from gradual exhaustion seven months afterward."He also relates the following case of excision of the rectum: The
patient, a female aged thirty-five years, first noticed some rectal
{915} irritation about four years ago.This was followed by distressing
pain during defecation and by hemorrhages; finally a tumor, which was
described by her medical attendant as being like an opened umbrella,
protruded, partly at first, then fully, through the anus.The growth
seemed to be spongy in character, and was very vascular.It was removed
by carrying a double-threaded needle through the mass, and thus
ligating it.Upon the seventh day after the operation a hemorrhage
occurred, which was controlled by plugging the rectum.Although the
growth was removed, the patient did not make a good recovery; symptoms
of rectal irritation continued.In September, 1884, the patient
presented herself in a wretched condition, with bearing-down pains and
frequent hemorrhages.Upon digital examination an elevated mass was
readily detected upon the sacral aspect of the bowel.By carrying the
fingers beyond this mass and making traction, it was brought down
within working distance, and was excised along with the entire lower
portion of the rectum.The freshly-cut edges of the gut were then drawn
down and stitched to the mucous membrane just above the anus.The
patient made a good recovery and has a serviceable anus.R. J. Levis[45] has operated upon two cases of cancerous growth in the
rectum, removing the lower part of the bowel.The first case was that
of a man aged sixty, who made a very good recovery from the successful
operation, although three inches of the gut were removed.The second
case was that of a man aged fifty-two, who had a carcinomatous tumor
the size of a hen's egg at the right side of the rectum.The section of
gut excised was about one and a half inches in length.The patient died
of peritonitis upon the fourth day after operation.At the autopsy
there was no wound found in the peritoneum, the lowest point of which
was one inch above the end of the excised bowel.[Footnote 45: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, pp.The etherized patient, his bladder having been emptied, should be
placed in the lithotomy position.If a male, a sound should be passed
into the bladder.An incision is then carried from the centre of the
perineum along the raphe to the anterior margin of the anus, encircling
the latter by two semicircular cuts and continuing the division
directly back to the coccyx.In the female the incision should begin
just posterior to the vagina.If the anus is not included in the
diseased mass, the external sphincter may be spared by raising the skin
and the muscle together and turning them on each side.When the lower
end of the rectum is reached the dissection should be made entirely by
the fingers or by the handle of the knife, tying vessels as they
spring.Double ligatures should be introduced through the gut from its
mucous surface outward, and, when possible, then stitched to the skin
at the margins of the wound.The bowels should be controlled by opium
for the following eight or ten days.The other operative procedure is lumbar colotomy.This was first
advocated by Amussat in 1839, when he appeared in a treatise upon the
subject entitled _On the Possibility of Establishing an Artificial Anus
in the Lumbar Region_.It is denied that he ever performed this
operation.It has happened to sound surgeons and skilful operators,
when the patient has been very muscular or very fat or when the colon
has been collapsed, that they have been at length compelled to abandon
the search for the gut {916} and to stitch up the external wound.Allingham states that the cause of failure often is that the colon is
searched for too far from the spine, resulting, in the opening of the
peritoneum, in the starting up into the wound of a mass of small
intestine which baffles the operator very seriously.He, having made
more than fifty dissections, has come to this conclusion: "that the
descending colon is always normally situated half an inch posterior to
the centre of the crest of the ileum (the centre being the point midway
between the anterior, superior, and posterior-superior spinous
processes)."An incision four inches in length should be made midway
between the last rib and the crest of the ileum.The incision may be
made transverse, or, better, obliquely downward and forward, as
suggested by Bryant.Allingham says that care should be taken to
preserve the original length of the incision down through all
structures, lest when the operator approaches the gut he finds himself
working in the apex of a triangle the base of which is the line of the
wound.If the surgeon has reason to expect the gut to be collapsed, an
attempt should be made to distend it with some fluid.The intestine
should be drawn well out through the wound, and a longitudinal opening
an inch in length made in it.The edges of this are to be stitched to
the edges of the skin.Fecal matter is much less likely to flow into
the wound if the sutures are passed through the intestine previous to
opening it.A weak carbolated wash is all that is required as a
dressing.In one case of stricture of the rectum from a scirrhous mass,
in which Morton performed colotomy, an immense cyst of the kidney,
which was somewhat puzzling for a moment, protruded in the wound.After
emptying the cyst the gut was readily discovered and opened.DILATATION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTAL POUCHES.--This is a
comparatively rare condition of the rectum, called by Physick encysted
rectum, which is treated by bending the end of a probe into a hook,
passing it up into the bowel, and then withdrawing it with its
extremity resting against the surface, so as to engage and draw down
the pouches, the straining or bearing down of the patient assisting in
their extrusion; they may then be incised or cut off with a pair of
curved scissors.LOSS OF CO-ORDINATION IN THE MUSCLES OF DEFECATION.--In those cases
where it can be ascertained that this curious trouble is not
symptomatic, sympathetic, nor reflex, the treatment must be directed to
the building up of the general health, such as electricity, baths,
asafoetida, and iron.SPHINCTERISMUS.--This condition, though frequently attendant upon, may
exist in the absence of, any fissure, crack, or ulcer of the anus.In its treatment magnesia and
rhubarb are to be used, and the diet must be simple, unstimulating, and
taken at regular intervals.A hot hip-bath at night, with the use of a
belladonna suppository, often proves effective.In more obstinate cases
a bougie covered with ointment of belladonna should be used daily.In
still more intractable cases the muscle must be forcibly stretched with
the fingers.In the more obstinate cases which now and then occur it
becomes necessary to completely divide the fibres of the sphincter
muscle, followed by a thorough stretching of the parts.{917} PRURITUS ANI.--This distressing and vexatious complaint proceeds
frequently from hemorrhoids.When caused by the presence of seat-worms,
they must be dislodged by purgatives and enemata of quassia or of one
composed of one part of carbolic acid to six parts of sweet oil, or of
turpentine and flaxseed tea.An enema of milk of asafoetida answers a
good purpose.If the pruritus is a result of the burrowing of the itch
insect, any wash, ointment, or dressing that evolves sulphuretted
hydrogen will rapidly bring relief.If caused by other parasites, an
application of ung.or red precipitate ointment, followed by a
warm bath, will be all that is necessary.In some it is a symptom of
dyspepsia, in others of a disordered state of the nerves of the anus
independent of local cause: in this case iron, quinia, and arsenic
should be given, and the patient should live an outdoor life as much as
possible.The remedies that have in turn been extolled and abandoned
during the treatment of this distressing condition it would require too
much space to even mention.The following are among the best: Sulphate
of zinc and alum, equal parts, are to be placed in an earthen vessel
and heated until a glassy mass is left, which is to be dissolved in a
little water and thrown into the bowel; palm soap pressed into the
anus, ointments of carbolic acid and morphia or of bromide of potassium
and cosmoline, citrine and other mercurial ointments, and suppositories
containing iodoform.Allingham uses a bone or a metallic plug of
peculiar construction, so as to keep the anus upon the stretch at night
without slipping into the bowel.The pressure which this exerts upon
the nerves and vessels prevents the itching.Hot (not warm) water
pressed against the anus with a sponge, or ten-drop doses internally of
tincture of gelsemium, or washes of dilute hydrocyanic acid or of
chloroform, or ointments of balsam of Peru or of veratria and aconitia,
or the corrosive chloride of mercury in solution applied locally, are a
few of the more reliable among this host.STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM (NON-MALIGNANT).--The main modes of treatment
of non-malignant stricture of the rectum are two--by dilatation or by
linear incision (rectotomy).Dilatation may be practised by the finger
alone or by the finger covered with hollow rubber covers of various
sizes.These are open at the end, so that the guiding and recognizing
sense of touch may be left to the end of the finger.When the stricture
is out of reach of this method, either gum or metallic bougies must be
used, beginning with the smaller sizes and deliberately and carefully
adding sizes.When the lumen of a stricture is tortuous it is best to
use a long rather flexible rubber bougie having an olive-shaped
extremity.It is not necessary to leave these bougies standing for
hours in a stricture, according to the practice of some; this merely
excites inflammation.Should the stricture be irritable, every second
or third day would be sufficiently often to attempt dilatation.In
constrictions which are firm, but not sensitive, a good plan is to
insert a Molesworth elastic tube and gradually distend it by
hydrostatic pressure; Barnes's dilators have also been successfully
used.When the stricture is elastic and re-forms itself at once after
dilatation, incision should be practised.In those strictures which are
low down, the constriction may be nicked in several places by a hernia
knife, the blade of which is guided along a finger in the bowel; when
high up, a long double-bladed knife must be employed.In syphilitic
strictures, in addition to dilatation, proper alterative treatment is
{918} indispensable.As dilatation has often to be kept up for a long
time, the patient may be taught to practise this for himself.PERI-ANAL AND PERI-RECTAL ABSCESS.--When acute, and when the surgeon is
called in time, the prompt application of leeches may abort the
abscess, but usually, by the time the surgeon sees it, it is necessary
to apply hot flaxseed poultices as fast as they become cool, keeping
the patient in bed upon light diet.The rule is to open deeply and
freely so soon as the least softening under the poultices indicates
that pus is within reach.After lancing, the poultices should be
continued for a few days: then the deep wound should be packed with a
strip of oiled lint and allowed to granulate from the bottom.As the
fetor of these abscesses is horrible, they should be injected with a
solution of permanganate of potash or liq.When the
chronic variety of this abscess is discovered, it, with all its
sinuses, diverticula, and pockets, should be laid freely open upon a
director and packed with carbolized lint.It is often very necessary in
these chronic cases to use tonic and alterative treatment, such as
cod-liver oil and iodide of iron.GONORRHOEA OF THE RECTUM.--Undoubted cases of gonorrhoea of the rectum
in the persons of prostitutes have been observed.Burning heat and
great pain are usually felt, with a free discharge of pure pus: the
mucous membrane is always intensely inflamed.The treatment is simple;
an injection of lead-water and laudanum or of sulphate of zinc answers
a good purpose.Primary syphilitic disease of the anus and rectum is
rarely seen, but of course the treatment indicated would be similar to
that laid down for primary syphilis in its usual localities.IMPACTION OF FECES.--This condition usually occurs among the aged and
in women after parturition and in cases of paralysis.Those persons of
sedentary habits who do not pay sufficient attention to the necessity
of a daily alvine evacuation sometimes find themselves in this
condition.Impaction occurs not infrequently among the insane, and more
frequently among women than men.Allingham states that he has never
seen a case of impaction in a young person; but Wetherill now has under
his care a most obstinate case of this disorder in a young man whose
system has been completely broken down by intemperance in drink.In paralysis of the rectum of traumatic origin impaction is almost
certain to take place unless great care is taken to prevent it.Diarrhoea is a very misleading element in these cases, and is a symptom
which frequently deceives those who are not on their guard.The clayey
mass of feculent matter forms a hard ball in the distended bowel,
around which the small loose passages flow.Spasm of the sphincter ani
is the usual accompaniment of impaction, and the muscle should be
gently but thoroughly dilated before means can be used to free the
canal.The finger or the handle of a tablespoon is best to use in the
dislodgment of these masses, and should be oiled before introduction,
the accumulation broken up, and then washed out by an enema of soap,
turpentine, and warm water.Purgatives and hydragogue cathartics
usually fail to give relief, and add much to the patient's discomfort.The bowel once freed, care must be taken to prevent a reaccumulation,
which very readily takes place, as the bowel in these cases is
distended and has lost tone.To this end frequent enemata of cold water
should be used, and the patient should {919} take a pill of dried
sulphate of iron, sulphate of quinia, extract of nux vomica, extract of
aloes, as recommended by Allingham.An
excellent adjunct to this treatment is the local use of the faradic
galvanic current daily after breakfast.Let the patient lie upon a bed
and apply one pole or electrode to the anus, while the other one is
passed with pressure along the course of the large intestine.Not
infrequently it happens after this has been continued for a few minutes
that a very urgent desire is felt to go to stool.In the case mentioned
of the young man affected with impaction this treatment answered
admirably well, but before its use he had to take a small dose of
croton oil daily to cause an action of the bowels, all milder measures
having proved ineffectual.It is important in these cases to interdict
a sedentary mode of life.IRRITABLE RECTUM.--A rectum is said to be irritable when it shows an
intolerance of the presence of feces or flatus, causing frequent desire
to go to stool.From such abnormal activity of the part there arise a
burning, uncomfortable impression of fulness and a soreness of the
anus.If after examination it is found that there is no local exciting
cause, a starch enema containing forty drops of laudanum should be
given and retained.Should the irritability prove to be obstinate, examine the rectum, and
if a spot of redness or increased vascularity be found, touch the spot
with strong nitric acid.CONCRETIONS IN THE RECTUM.--These occur less frequently than do
impactions, and differ from them in being cylindrical and nucleated,
the nuclei being such bodies as balls or tangled masses of hair, or
coins, buttons, biliary calculi, or the like.Covering these are matted
animal or vegetable fibres or hardened fecal matter.They are not so
readily dislodged as are impactions, and it is necessary to dilate the
sphincter thoroughly and remove them with a scoop.Not infrequently
these bodies are bathed in pus and are very fetid.PROCTITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTUM.--This may be either acute or
chronic, the latter being a disease of the aged.Allingham recommends
in this variety small doses of Barbadoes aloes to stimulate the bowel,
also such drugs as copaiba, turpentine, and black pepper.As an
injection in the acute form starch and laudanum, or bismuth suspended
in a mucilaginous vehicle, should be used.Probably the use of small,
smooth fragments of ice in the rectum would allay the tenesmus and help
to subdue the inflammation.PROLAPSUS ANI AND PROCIDENTIA.--Prolapsus occurs much more frequently
in children than in adults, making its appearance at every movement of
the bowels.The child thus affected should not be allowed to sit upon
the chamber-vessel and strain, but should lie upon the side or stand,
while the nurse should be instructed to draw to one side one of the
buttocks so as to tighten the anal orifice.After the motion the
protruded part should be well washed in cold water, and afterward with
some astringent solution of oak-bark, matico, or a weak solution of
carbolic acid applied with a soft sponge.The bowel should then be
gently returned and the child be allowed to lie at rest for a while.If
there exists intestinal irritation, small doses of mercury with chalk,
with rhubarb at night, with wine of iron three times daily, would be
indicated.{920} The application of an anal pad and a T-bandage will
give sufficient support.If this treatment be carried out a cure
usually results in a few weeks.Some cases do not yield to this mode,
and then the surgeon has to make trial of ergotin given hypodermically,
each injection representing a grain of ergot, which is to be thrown
into the submucous tissue of the rectum every second day for two weeks.Should relief not follow its use, cauterization is to be tried.The
cauterants usually applied are nitrate of silver, acid nitrate of
mercury, and nitric acid.Of these, nitric acid is the best.After
anaesthesia is complete every portion of the extrusion should be
touched with the acid, care being taken not to bring it into contact
with the skin; afterward the bowel is to be freely oiled and returned.To prevent its extrusion the bowel should be filled with soft cotton
wool, a compress placed over the anus, and the buttocks strapped
tightly together with adhesive plaster.For a general quieting effect
the child should be given paregoric.About the fourth day the adhesive
plaster may be removed and a dose of castor oil administered, which
will bring away the cotton plug with the dejection.Prolapsus and procidentia in the adult are much less manageable;
indeed, these conditions are usually very obstinate.There may exist
causes extraneous to the bowel, such as urethral stricture or enlarged
prostate or an impacted renal calculus or a calculus of the prostate.The bowel should be searched for polypi or hemorrhoids, and the
prolapse may be cured by the removal of the irritating cause.Failing
to find any such cause, the surgeon has at his command either
cauterization or a removal of redundancy.The former may be by nitrate
of silver or acid nitrate of mercury or the actual cautery.It is well
not to apply these strong acids to the aged or those who are broken
down in health, as very destructive sloughing has followed their use in
these cases.When these are used, the same plan as that mentioned in
case of prolapse in children should be pursued.Strong carbolic acid
may be used in these cases with much less risk of sloughing than when
the acid is employed, and it may be applied oftener--indeed, daily if
desirable.Van Buren has recommended linear cauterization with the hot
iron to the mucous membrane, the bowel contracting as a result of
cicatrization.In adults generally, and especially in the aged, all the
forms of cauterization are less satisfactory as a means of relief than
either of the various modifications of Copeland's operation, which
consists in removing by ligation elliptical portions of the mucous and
submucous tissues of the prolapsed bowel.The most satisfactory of
these is either to excise two or three oval portions of the mucous
membrane with flat-curved scissors and bring the edges together with
interrupted suture, or to pinch up in several places the redundancy in
a Smith's clamp and cut off the folds in advance of the instrument,
applying to the stumps the hot iron.Allingham prefers ligatures of
horsehair in these operations, and mentions the carbolized catgut in
preference to silk.He cautions the operator not to carry his knife
into the submucous tissue, as free hemorrhage would inevitably occur.In old cases of prolapsus or of procidentia that are not amenable to
operative treatment much can be done to render them comfortable: the
air-dilated gum pessary will sometimes afford relief, or a pad and
T-bandage will prevent the parts becoming ulcerated by friction.Neither gallic {921} nor tannic acid answers the purpose so well as
acorn flour.The frequent use of cold water to the part is always
attended with comfort, and sometimes with relief.In these old cases of
great relaxation Nelaton has used strychnia by the mouth, and Weber (of
New York) hypodermically, with fair result.Vidal has cured three cases
by the repeated use of ergotin locally, hypodermically.In order to
bring about a radical cure in these very chronic cases, very decided
means sometimes are justifiable.Hey of Leeds was the
first to propose a plan by which, through cicatricial contraction and
inflammatory gluing together of the various tissues composing the
bowel, the anus and sphincter muscle might be strengthened and improved
in tone; to which end he proposed to cut away the pendulous flaps of
skin around the anus.In cases where these flaps are very redundant a
cure is sometimes effected by this procedure alone.Other cases will be
benefited by the operation proposed by Dupuytren, which consists in the
removal of radiating folds of the skin and mucous membrane at the edge
of the anus.To quote from Holmes's _System of Surgery_: "This
operation is effected by laying hold of the fold of skin on each side
of the anus with forceps, then with a sharp curved pair of scissors
removing both skin and mucous membrane.In very severe cases four or
six applications of the scissors may be necessary."POLYPUS OF THE RECTUM.--The polypi of the rectum are the gelatinoid and
the fibroid, but as a very rare occurrence a villous or warty polypus
has been found.Polypoid growths are very different bodies, but they
are too frequently confounded with true polypi.The only treatment is
their removal, and the safest method is by ligation of the pedicle, and
either cutting off the growth in advance of the knot or returning it
into the bowel.The patient should remain quiet until the sloughing is
complete, and his bowels must be confined, otherwise profuse and very
troublesome hemorrhage might ensue.Their removal by the clamp and
cautery is equally safe.Their removal by torsion or by the scissors is
unsafe.The peculiar villous polypus causes great and exhausting hemorrhage.A
case was successfully treated by the application of fuming nitric acid.FISTULA IN ANO.--In the palliative treatment of this very common malady
no great amount of relief can be afforded.Those who are aged and
feeble or those who are much broken down will find comfort to attend
the free local use of warm water, and the sinuses should be injected
with dilute solutions of one of the mineral astringents, the strength
of these not exceeding two grains to the fluidounce of water.Cosmoline, simple cerate, ointment of the oxide of zinc, and even fresh
lard, make the patient easier, as they prevent friction of the
buttocks.One of the forms of the radical treatment consists in the
division of all the structures between the fistulous tract and the
surface.This may be accomplished either by the use of the knife or by
seton.Stimulating injections or cauterization has been known
occasionally to permanently close fistulae in ano; but such plans of
treatment are unreliable, and usually unjustifiable.When the fistula
is not so high up in the bowel as to render the use of the knife
unsafe, this plan of treatment should be adopted.As an invariable
preliminary to all operations upon the rectum the bowels should be
thoroughly emptied and the patient should be placed under the influence
of {922} an anaesthetic.A flexible grooved director should then be
carried through the opening of the tract upon the surface and along the
tract to its opening in the bowel, should such exist.The forefinger
within the rectum will meet the point of the director as it emerges
from the internal opening, and the director should be pushed onward and
its extremity guided outward until it rests fairly upon the sound
integument outside, and all the included structures should be divided
along the groove of the director with a sharp-pointed curved bistoury.Should the fore finger in the rectum not discover an internal opening,
one should be forced at the very bottom of the tract by rotating the
point of the director while making counter-pressure with the end of the
finger.Should several fistulae be found, they should be treated in
like manner.Sometimes it will be found that the incision is overlapped
by the dusky-red flaps composing its margins, in which case they should
be trimmed off with scissors.When the tract extends deeper than its
internal opening, the latter should be ignored and the sinus laid open
to its very bottom.When no external opening exists, one should be
made, and the guide for this incision will be a point of induration
felt by the finger at some point not far from the surface.The director
entering at this point will find the tract, and should be pushed
forward as described above.These opened sinuses should be packed with
lint soaked in carbolized oil and confined by a pad and a T-bandage.It
is the practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital to apply after division a
stick of caustic potassa, allowing it to remain in contact with the cut
surfaces for several seconds, after which the wounds are to be packed.The bowels should
be confined for a few days, after which a dose of oil may be given.Besides attention to cleanliness and a daily renewing of the packing no
further treatment will be demanded.The hemorrhage attending these
operations is usually trifling.Should a vessel spring, a ligature may
be thrown around it.When an abundant general oozing occurs, the rectum
must be packed and a compress and bandage firmly applied.Should the
surgeon prefer the seton operation, he should carry several threads of
stout silk or a piece of rubber cord on an eyed probe into the fistula
and out of its internal opening, and by tying their ends firmly down
upon the enclosed tissues slowly effect the same result as in the
cutting operation.When the seton used is silk, the ends should be
carried through holes in a round leaden plate or through those of an
ordinary button, and tied.These setons are to be drawn tighter every
three or four days until the division of the enclosed tissues is
complete.The subsequent treatment is the same as in the other
operation.A difference of opinion exists among surgeons as to the propriety of
operating for fistula in ano in persons afflicted with tubercular
disease of the lungs.The practice of the present day is decidedly in
favor of operating, without reference to the condition of the lungs,
provided the patient is not too much reduced in strength.An operation for fistula in ano has been proposed and practised by
Reeves, which is a compromise between cutting and ligation.He says:
"It consisted in passing a strong and well-waxed silk ligature along
the track of the fistula into the bowel.An ordinary surgical probe
with an eye in its end carried this thread into the rectum.My bivalve
expanding speculum was previously introduced, and by its use there was
no difficulty {923} in seeing and seizing the ligature and bringing it
out through the anus.The probe was then withdrawn, and the ends of the
silk were wound round two strong pieces of wood which were held between
the fingers of each hand.An assistant passed a finger on either side
of the track of the fistula to steady the tissues and to resist the
traction which was put on the silk thread.The two pieces of wood were
then drawn toward me with a rapid sawing motion, and the fistula was
quickly divided, with the loss of scarcely any blood.Some oiled lint
and a pad and bandage were applied in the usual way; and the wound
healed well.No anaesthetic was administered, and although the patient
did not relish the operation, still it was quite bearable, and what she
felt most was a burning sensation, due, doubtless, to the friction of
the silk."HEMORRHOIDS.--The treatment of this form of rectal and anal disease is
either medical or surgical according to the gravity of the case and
according to the obstinacy with which it resists local and general
therapeutic agents.An ordinary acute attack of external piles, such as
is often produced by neglect of the bowels, causing constipation, may
be treated in the following manner: The patient should rest and avoid
stimulating food and beverages.He should employ cold bathing to the
part frequently: indeed, great comfort and relief often follow this
treatment alone.An ointment of tannic acid, glycerin, and simple
cerate, or one containing calomel and extract of opium, will be found
useful.Fresh lard, cosmoline, vaseline, cold cream, ointment of the
oxide of zinc (benzoated) or an ointment containing extract of opium,
extract of galls, and extract of belladonna or stramonium, are some
among many agents that have been extolled for their relief.H. C.
Wood[46] recommends enemata of solution of chlorate of potassium and
laudanum.Enemata of lime-water and linseed oil are recommended by
Agnew: "One of the very best formulas for allaying the irritation
incident to hemorrhoidal affections consists of the following
combination: Acetate of lead and tannin, of each fifteen grains;
carbonate of lead and extract of stramonium, of each thirty grains;
creasote, five drops.With a sufficient quantity of cocoa-butter mould
this into fifty suppositories."[47] The internal exhibition of the
balsam of copaiba, twenty drops in capsules taken four or five times
daily, or the use of fifteen drops of liquor potassa rubbed up with
half a drachm of the balsam into emulsion, taken three times a day, has
been much extolled, as has also the confection of black pepper.Sometimes these various means will cure a chronic or long-standing case
of piles, either internal or external.Wetherill has found that the
topical application of rectified oil of amber has cured long-standing
cases of piles.This oil should not be applied in cases where much
inflammation exists, and where the piles are internal the best mode of
bringing it in contact with them is to incorporate from three to five
minims of the oil with sufficient cocoa-butter to make a suppository.One of these, pushed into the bowel night and morning for a week, will
not infrequently cause the piles to shrink up and finally to disappear.The bowels should be kept open with the compound powder of licorice.It
should be remembered that magnesia irritates hemorrhoids.Success has
followed the internal use of ergotin, of the fluid extract of hamamelis
virginica, of the corn blast (ustilago maidis), and of small doses of
aloes combined with hyoscyamus.{924} D. Young has had good results
follow the internal use of glycerin.Chronic cases of piles have been
cured by the application of ointments containing carbonate of lead,
creasote, carbolic acid, or iodoform.Ergotin used hypodermically in
the vicinity of the anus or injected into the piles has frequently
resulted in a complete cure, and the same may be said of the injection
of carbolic acid directly into the tumors.In the application of cold
water to inflamed piles it should be borne in mind that its forcible
impingement upon them in a fine stream acts far more efficiently than
the mere bathing them.Some cases do better under the use of warm water
or warm sedative and astringent lotions.A warm flaxseed poultice mixed
with laudanum is a very comfortable application.In obstinate cases of
prolapse Agnew[48] recommends the use of a rectal obturator or the use
of a hemorrhoidal truss.[Footnote 47: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, p.[Footnote 48: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.Those who suffer from prolapse of piles should avoid the habitual use
of cushioned seats.They should assume a semi-erect posture during
defecation, or, when this is attended with difficulty or inconvenience,
they should contrive a portable water-closet seat by boring a hole an
inch and a half in diameter through a piece of planed board, bevelling
it so as to fit the person.These means will often prevent the
extrusion of the tumors.After defecation the patient should rest for a
little while in the recumbent attitude.The careful touching of external piles with strong nitric acid is a
mode of treatment that has been quite successful in the hands of some
surgeons.The intolerable itching of these bodies can be allayed by
touching them with tincture of aconite-root or with a concentrated
tincture of prickly-ash bark.Freezing them with the ether spray allays
the pain and itching for the time being, but these symptoms return with
redoubled energy after the effect has subsided.Should an attack of the external variety of piles not result in
absorption, but leave an excrescence, painless but inconvenient, and
liable at any time to become inflamed, excision would be in order.Divide the integument by an incision radiating from the anus, separate
the skin from the tumor down to its base, and after seizing it with
toothed forceps cut it off with scissors curved on the flat.Little
flaps or tabs of skin remaining after piles may be snipped off with
scissors.It is not well to operate upon external piles unless they
obstinately resist all milder treatment.There are frequently venous
enlargements containing blood-clot, and when this condition exists
proceed as follows: Pinch up the little tumor between the thumb and
finger of the left hand; transfix its base with a curved bistoury, and
cut out; at the same time, by pressure with the thumb and finger,
extrude the clot.Fill the bottom of the little sac with cotton wool,
and the operation is complete.It is not necessary in these cases to
wait until the inflammation subsides before operating.The operative treatment of the internal variety may be by
strangulation, by the cautery, by the ecraseur, and by the use of
caustics.The former of these is the safest and most convenient method,
and the one usually employed in the Pennsylvania Hospital, and should
be performed in the following manner: The lower bowel having been
thoroughly evacuated and the patient etherized, the operator should
gently but firmly stretch the sphincter.The patient should be placed
upon the side, with {925} the upper part of the body prone, the hips
elevated, and the thighs flexed upon the abdomen.Transfix the largest
tumor with a strong, long-handled tenaculum, cut through the skin at
the base with a knife or scissors around its external half, and hand
the hook to an assistant, instructing him to make gentle traction.Then
encircle the mass with a stout cord if the mass is not too large, or
pass a stout needle threaded with a double silk ligature, from without
inward, deeply through the base of the pile, drawing it through the
mucous membrane on the opposite side; cut loose the needle and tie
tightly, so as to completely strangulate the included tissues on either
side and leave the ends of the ligature long.Treat all the remaining
tumors in a similar manner seriatim, and then with scissors cut away
the strangulated bodies to within a safe distance of the ligatures, the
ends of which are now to be cut off close.Place an opium suppository
in the bowel, and the operation is complete.When for any sufficiently good reason the patient will not bear the
ordinary anaesthetics, it will become necessary to modify the operation
as follows: The tumors having been well extruded by enema of warm water
or by the efforts of the patient, bend him forward over a chair and
direct an assistant to draw aside the buttocks.Then pass the double
ligatures as before indicated, but refrain from tying until all the
tumors are thus secured, as the operator will find it convenient to
draw upon the ligatures to keep the mass of piles within view and
working-distance.Then draw down each tumor, cut around its base, and
tie as before; cut off the ends of the ligatures and the greater
portion of each strangulated tumor, and return everything within the
bowel, and follow with an opium suppository.In many cases Morton has
used the nitrous oxide gas with the best results.The hook should then
be withdrawn, and each knot should be drawn more firmly down prior to
its reduplication.Following this procedure, if properly carried out,
the tumors will change color, becoming blue, thus indicating complete
strangulation.The operation by the clamp and cautery is a good method when the
hemorrhoidal tumors are small.Cusack of
Dublin, and the clamp employed is that invented by Mr.This instrument is so well known that a detailed description of
it would be unnecessary.In operating with it the tumor is to be drawn
well out and the clamp applied close up to its attachment with the
bowel.Strangulation is effected by means of the screw which runs
through the shafts of the handles.This accomplished, the strangulated
portion is cut off with scissors, which should leave a stump
three-eighths of an inch long.To this stump apply the actual cautery
at a dull red heat, touching its every portion, after which unscrew and
remove the clamp and look for hemorrhage.Should any occur, touch the
bleeding point with the hot iron.Confine the patient to bed for five
or six days and give sufficient opium to confine the bowels.After this
time has elapsed administer a dose of oil.Remember that but one pile
should be clamped at one time."The taking two piles into the clamp at
once is sure to result in hemorrhage."Do not allow the cautery-iron to
touch the clamp.After the operation return the parts within the
sphincter and cut off any tabs of redundant integument with scissors.The removal of internal piles by means of the ecraseur was the favorite
operation of Chassaignac, but it is a mode of procedure which is now
{926} regarded with disfavor by the best surgeons on account of the
liability to hemorrhage, and from the fact that troublesome and
injurious contractions of the anus have not infrequently followed its
use.The employment of iron or copper wire instead of the usual chain
has been recommended by those who prefer this mode of operation.The
plan adopted by Chassaignac was to pedunculate the piles by tying a
ligature around the base and drawing them down.The chain being then
applied, the strangulation and crushing off was slowly accomplished by
means of the lever of the instrument.It should take from twenty to
twenty-five minutes' crushing to accomplish this object.For the treatment of internal piles by caustics Houston of Dublin used
strong nitric acid.A fenestrated speculum should be employed, and the
acid should be applied with a piece of wood or with a glass brush, care
being taken to limit its action to the tumors, the redundant liquid
being mopped up with a swab of lint or prepared absorbent cotton.The
entire surface should afterward be bathed in oil.The acid is relied
upon to produce a granulating surface, by the healing of which and by
the subsequent contraction a cure is sometimes achieved.At best, this
plan of treatment has proved tedious and unsatisfactory.Chloride of zinc and caustic potassa are even more unsatisfactory
agents for this purpose than the acid, as they are very violent in
local destruction and their action is very difficult to limit.The use
of caustic potassa was last revived by Amussat, but failed to find
favor from his contemporaries, and soon fell into merited disuse.Van
Buren says: "From recent experience with the thermo-cautery of
Paquelin, I am disposed to regard it as more manageable than nitric
acid, and at least equally efficient."Allingham mentions favorably the
strong carbolic acid as a substitute for the nitric as an application
to vascular and granular surfaces.The reckless method employed by the
older surgeons of cutting off internal piles with the knife or with
scissors, without any precautions against bleeding, is merely mentioned
in condemnation.Usually no serious symptoms are to be expected after
operations for hemorrhoids, but to this general rule there are
exceptions.Morton knows of two consecutive cases of tetanus after this
operation performed in a hospital in this city, and both terminated
fatally.One of the most common occurrences after the ligation of piles
is retention of urine, generally lasting for a day or two and requiring
the use of the catheter.HEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECTUM.--Bleeding from these parts is more usually
of a venous than an arterial character, but in some cases of
hemorrhoids the bleeding is either arterial or arterio-venous.The
latter occurs upon the detachment of a polypus, but not necessarily of
a polypoid growth.Arterial or mixed bleeding occurs in carcinoma and
in rodent ulcer, and also from the stumps of badly-occluded piles.In
cases of vicarious menstruation from the rectum the venous blood simply
oozes from the surface of the over-congested mucous membrane.This
condition should be readily diagnosed by the physical properties of the
blood and from the history of the patient.In almost all cases of
bleeding near the anus it will be possible to pick up the vessel or the
bleeding point on a tenaculum and ligate with silk, which is the most
satisfactory method to the surgeon.The rectum has been dragged down
with volsella forceps to apply a ligature to a point high up, but in
some of these cases the acupressure pin {927} with the twisted suture
will be found more convenient.Should hemorrhage occur after the
ligation of piles which cannot be checked by ligature, such as a
general oozing, pass all the ligatures through a hole made in the
centre of a small round sponge, then tie them across a piece of stick
(thus constructing a sort of tourniquet), and twist this around.Van
Buren cites a case in which a sudden laceration of the integument and
sphincter occurred during forcible dilatation in a case of hemorrhoids
in a very broken-down subject, with very copious hemorrhage.He passed
a sponge armed with a double ligature into the bowel, and, directing an
assistant to make traction upon the threads, the bleeding was checked.Injecting ice-water and perchloride of iron into the rectum will often
check hemorrhage.Allingham prefers the persulphate of iron to any
other styptic for this purpose.Passing fragments of ice into the bowel
while holding a lump of ice upon the sacrum sometimes answers a good
purpose.In many cases of secondary hemorrhage from large venous
sinuses in a state of ulceration it will be impossible to ligate, and
the use of the ordinary styptics will be but the waste of valuable
time: the bowel must be tamponed as follows: Thread a strong silk
ligature through near the apex of a cone-shaped sponge, and bring it
back again, so that the apex of the sponge is held in a loop of thread.Wet the sponge, squeeze it dry, and fill its meshes with ferric alum or
with persulphate of iron.Pass the left fore finger into the bowel, and
upon it push up the sponge, apex first, by means of a metal rod or any
other convenient body, fully five inches into the rectum.Now fill the
rectum below this with cotton-wool filled with the styptic.The bowel
having been completely filled, make traction upon the ligatures (thus
spreading out the bell-shaped sponge), while with the other hand push
up the packing.If this is carefully done no fear of bleeding need be
apprehended.In these cases the patient often suffers from collections
of flatus, which may be obviated at the time of packing by placing a
flexible catheter in the bowel and packing around it.These plugs
should remain for at least five or six days, and frequently eight or
ten days are none too long.The packing must then be picked carefully
away from the sponge.Agnew's rectal chemise answers the same purpose.In describing its application he says: "Through the openings at the end
of the largest-sized gum catheter pass a strong silk thread; take three
square pieces of the material usually known as mosquito-netting,
placing them one on top of the other; at the centre of these squares or
pieces make an opening, and pass the catheter through it, securing the
two together by the threads.In applying the instrument the different
layers of the chemise must be moistened with water, and afterward well
filled with the persulphate of iron.It is then conducted some distance
into the rectum on a finger previously inserted; after which it is
expanded like a parachute by packing between the catheter and its hood
with long strips of lint thrust up on the end of a bougie until the
bowel is distended on every side.The catheter will serve to conduct
away the flatus, and when, after eight or ten days, its removal becomes
necessary, this is very easily effected by drawing out the ribbon-like
pieces of lint which were used as packing."Another method is to stuff
the bowel with fragments of sponge to which threads are tied, the ends
of which, protruding from the anus, facilitate their withdrawal.In
conjunction with these procedures the patient's pelvis should be
elevated.{928} After excision of portions of the mucous membrane the
risk of hemorrhage will be lessened by the surgeon introducing through
the edges of each incision a few fine sutures.Enormous quantities of blood may escape into the bowel after operations
without any external symptom being apparent until the patient becomes
pallid and weak.In other cases the patient will complain of tenesmus
and desire to go to stool, or of a sensation of something trickling
into the bowel.Upon the recognition of these symptoms search should at
once be made for internal hemorrhage.Before taking leave of this very interesting class of diseases and of
their modes of treatment, it seems proper to introduce a few remarks
upon the subject of rectal alimentation, as it is now a well-recognized
and much-practised means of sustaining those whose stomachs are unequal
to the work which in health is so easily and unconsciously performed.In the use of the lower bowel as an absorbent surface of alimentary
substances many failures have been reported, a fair proportion of
which, it is safe to infer, are due to the methods employed, to the
nutritive matters employed, and to the condition of the rectum at the
time.Firstly, as to the state of the rectum, it must be empty.Wait a
reasonable time, say an hour, after stool, so that the gut may be more
passive; have the patient in the recumbent posture; direct him to
resist tenesmus and to exert both the will and the muscular power to
retain the aliment.The syringe must be of hard rubber, must be
rectal-ended, and of the capacity of two fluidounces, and perfect in
action.The preparation to be introduced, after being warmed to a temperature
of 98 degrees or 99 degrees F., should be very slowly injected with the
syringe, which should be also warmed and oiled.The enema must never
exceed in amount two fluidounces.If this be rejected, wait a
reasonable time and try again, using a less amount.If tenesmus proves
an insurmountable barrier to ordinary means, an opium suppository is to
be introduced three hours prior to another attempt.It has been
suggested, inasmuch as tenesmus is often relieved by the application of
cold to the rectum, to introduce the aliment in that state; but this
method is open to the objection that rectal digestion would be much
less likely to take place under this condition, as the bowel would then
have thrown upon it the additional work of warming up the substance
prior to absorbing it.The usual errors made in applying this means of sustaining the patient
are, that the injections are too large, are too rapidly introduced, and
are not of the proper temperature.Allowing an interval of eight hours
between the enemata would afford three in the twenty-four hours, which
method has been found to offer the best results.This must be
persevered in at regular daily intervals for the patient to derive its
full benefit, and there is reason to suppose that the nervous system
gets expectant of these daily hours of support, as it does in the case
of our ordinary meal-times.An examination of the well-formed daily
stools of patients thus sustained will prove how close the analogy is
between this and digestion proper.{929} Next, as to the substances to be employed.The best of these are
milk, eggs, concentrated beef-extracts or beef or chicken peptones, and
brandy or whiskey of good quality.These substances may be combined in
various proportions to suit the individual requirements of the case.A
very good mixture for this purpose is two tablespoonfuls of milk, one
tablespoonful of whiskey, and an egg, using both the yelk and the
albumen.This should be well beaten up and
properly warmed.It is well to persevere in the use of these enemata even though at
first most of them appear to be rejected, as after a time, the rectum
becoming accustomed to their presence, absorption or so-called rectal
digestion may take place.This form of alimentation should be kept in
reserve in a case of chronic illness until all other methods of
sustaining the patient prove insufficient to support life.It is not
contraindicated even in some cases of chronic diarrhoea with persistent
vomiting and loss of peptic function, advantage being taken of the
intervals between the evacuations to introduce a small and very
concentrated nutrient enema.In ordinary cases not complicated by
diarrhoea the most convenient times will be found to be about seven
o'clock in the morning, three in the afternoon, and eleven at night.Wetherill suggests the possibility of forming with solid extract of
beef, pepsin, and pure suet a nutrient suppository which might be
retained and absorbed in some cases in which it has been found
impossible to retain the enemata.A very small addition of white wax,
he thinks, would keep these solid during warm weather; if not, the suet
might be replaced by ol.theobroma (as in ordinary suppositories),
which is probably as likely to be absorbed as the suet.{930}

INTESTINAL WORMS.BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M.D.All animals, except in general the simple cell-forms constituting the
sub-kingdom of protozoa, under ordinary circumstances are more or less
liable to be infested with others, called parasites, which commonly
live at the expense of their hosts, frequently with little or no
inconvenience, but often causing discomfort and suffering even unto
death.Parasites are distinguished as external and internal, the two
being mostly of a widely different character.The former chiefly
pertain to the division of arthropoda, or animals with jointed limbs,
as exemplified by lice, fleas, and flies of the class of insects, mites
of the class of arachnides, and epizoans and isopods of the class of
crustaceans.Internal parasites, from their usual habitation named entozoa, are
commonly observed in the intestines of animals, and hence their
distinction as intestinal worms.The name has proved to be appropriate,
for investigations have shown that most entozoa, observed from time to
time in other parts of the bodies of animals, pass part of their life
in the intestinal canal of the same or of some other animal.By far the greater number of entozoa are peculiar animals, constituting
the chief part of the scolecides, an extensive group of the sub-kingdom
of vermes or worms.Of this group they comprise the orders of CESTODES,
or tape-worms; the ACANTHOCEPHALI, or thorn-headed worms; the
TREMATODES, or fluke-worms; and the greater portion of the NEMATODES,
or thread-worms.Many entozoa also belong to the protozoa, but these,
so far as relates to man in a medical point of view, appear
unimportant, and will therefore not here enter into consideration.In the course of their life entozoa undergo changes of form and
condition, and pass these in different organs of the same or of
different animals, and it may be for a brief period externally or in a
non-parasitic state.In many instances, as in the tape-worms and the
fluke-worms, the transformations accompanying the changes are of so
extraordinary a character that until their life-history was
investigated the successive metamorphoses were viewed as distinct
animals.Mostly, the entozoa pass one stage of existence within the
intestine of some animal, and another stage in different organs of
other animals.Many, perhaps most species, in each stage are peculiar
to one or a few nearly-related animals, but others of the same kind
infest a number of different animals.The animals infested by the same
parasite may be remotely as well as nearly related.Thus the Taenia
saginata, or beef tape-worm, in the mature state lives in the small
intestine of man {931} only, but in its juvenile or larval condition in
the flesh meat of the ox.The Taenia elliptica, the common tape-worm of
the intestine of the dog, in the larval condition lives in the louse of
this animal.The liver-fluke, Distomum hepaticum, occasionally found in
the liver of man, but of common occurrence in the sheep, to which it
proves so destructive in the affection known as rot, in the juvenile
condition lives in a little fresh-water snail of the genus Lymneus.The
guinea-worm, Filaria medinensis, which in the mature state is found
beneath the skin of man, in the larval condition inhabits the minute
crustacean cyclops of stagnant waters.As would be reasonably supposed, entozoa commonly gain access to their
hosts through the food and drink, though in the case of aquatic animals
they also obtain entrance directly through the integument from the
surrounding medium.So long as they remain in the intestinal canal they
may occasion little trouble or inconvenience.When they are numerous in
this position or proportionately large, according to their peculiar
nature they may produce more or less suffering and even the most
serious consequences.Generally, however, it is when they occupy other
positions, to which they have migrated from the intestine, that they
induce aggravated symptoms proportioned to their numbers and the nature
of the organs they infest.Many species of entozoa have been discovered in man, and most of them
are peculiar in kind.Many are common, and, while some are widely
extended, others are more or less restricted to certain localities.They are variable in their frequency, largely proportioned to the
prevalence of habits which are favorable to their transmission, and
which, though under control, are more or less disregarded.Some species
are so rare in their occurrence that they seem to be accidental, and
therefore of comparatively little interest to the physician.In general, the frequency of occurrence of intestinal worms is
proportioned to the extent of use of uncooked or insufficiently cooked
meats, the drinking of unfiltered standing waters, uncleanly habits,
and the intimacy of association with domestic animals.It therefore
follows that important prophylactics against infection by parasites are
properly-cooked food, the use of spring or freely-running water or
filtered standing water, cleanly habits, and the avoidance of intimacy
with domestic animals.The Cestodes, or Tape-worms.Tape-worms in the mature condition inhabit the intestines of vertebrate
animals, and are usually conspicuous for their long, tape-like
appearance and jointed character.In the juvenile or larval state they
infest the various organs, except the interior of the intestinal canal,
of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and in this condition are so
diminutive and inconspicuous that until a comparatively recent period
they for the most part remained unnoticed, and when known their
relationship with the mature forms was not recognized.The mature tape-worm, as ordinarily observed, is a long, soft, flat,
white worm, which from its resemblance has received its familiar name.{932} It has a small head, succeeded by a short, more slender neck
gradually widening into the body, which is divided transversely into
segments.These, which are usually called joints or links, and also
named proglottides, are so many individuals, and finally become
separated to hold an independent existence.The tape-worm clings to the
mucous membrane of the intestine by its head, which is provided for the
purpose with suckers, and in many cases also with circlets of hooks.The segments of the body are incessantly produced by gradual growth and
successive division of the neck, and as they enlarge they become more
distinct and develop within a bisexual generative apparatus for each.The worm has neither mouth nor intestine, but is nourished by
imbibition from the surrounding liquid in which it lies constantly
bathed.A pair of longitudinal vessels commences in the head and
extends throughout the body, one on each side, and in some genera is
joined by a transverse vessel at the fore and back part of every
segment.The mature segments have no body-cavity, but are occupied with
a complex bisexual generative apparatus, which is self-impregnating.Finally the uterus, usually much ramified, becomes especially
conspicuous through distension with eggs, and the rest of the organs
for the most part become atrophied.The ripe segments successively
detach themselves from those in advance, often singly and not
infrequently several linked together.In this condition, often in
lively movement, they are discharged with the feces, and thus commonly
render themselves obvious to their host.Subsequently they may continue
to live a brief period externally in a non-parasitic condition.Ordinarily, in moist excrement, or in water or similar materials, they
will remain alive for several days.After the discharge of the tape-worm segments, together with the eggs
which had been previously laid by the latter and those still contained
within them, any or all may be swallowed by animals feeding in places
where the infected excrement has been deposited.When the proglottides
and eggs are taken into the stomach they are digested and the embryos
or proscolices are liberated.The embryo or proscolex of the tape-worm is a microscopic spherical or
oval body, provided at one pole with three pairs of divergent spicules,
by which it is enabled to penetrate the walls of the stomach or
intestine of its host.From these positions the embryo migrates either
directly or through the blood-vessels to some other organ, most
frequently the liver or the muscles.Having reached its destination, it
becomes fixed in position, and for a time remains comparatively
quiescent, but undergoes further development.The embryo loses its
spicules and is transformed into the larval form or scolex.In most
species of tape-worms the scolex is simple or individual in character,
and consists of a head like that of the parent or mature worm, with a
neck ending in a capacious cyst, within which the head and neck are
inverted.In this form the scolex is contained in a sac of connective
tissue induced by the presence of the parasite.Such sacs, frequently
observed imbedded in the flesh, liver, lungs, and other organs of
animals, are familiarly known as measles.In this condition the
scolices of certain tape-worms have long been known, but as their
relationship was not recognized, they were viewed as distinct species
of parasites and described as cysticerci.In other species of
tape-worms the scolex is of compound character; that is to say, the
embryo {933} in its further development gives rise to the production of
one or more groups of individuals in conjunction.The compound scolex
thus forms a sac or a group of sacs, the basis of hydatid tumors.These
occur of various sizes, even up to that of a child's head, and may
occupy any organ of the body.They consist of a spherical sac or group
of sacs, simple in character or containing others, ranging in size from
that of a mustard-seed to that of a marble, or larger to that of a
walnut, enclosed in an envelope of connective tissue induced by the
presence of the parasite.The sacs are filled with liquid, and have,
attached within or free and floating, or less frequently attached
without, variable numbers of little white grains, which on examination
with the microscope exhibit the same constitution as the simple scolex
above described.As in the case of the cysticerci of measles, the
scolices of hydatids have long been known, but as their relationship
with the mature forms was unrecognized until lately, they were regarded
as distinct parasites and described as echinococci and coenuri.Sometimes the compound scolex fails in development further than the
production of the sacs, which then constitute the so-called
acephalocysts.Measles with their occupants, when retained in the muscles or other
organs, ordinarily undergo no further development, but ultimately,
after some months to a year or two, undergo degradation.The larva or
scolex dies and atrophies; the measle degenerates, and often becomes
the focus of calcareous deposit, shrinks to a little cicatrix, and may
finally disappear.Of a more serious nature is the tape-worm embryo
which produces the hydatid tumor.With the increase of this,
proportioned to the production of sacs and scolices, it may become so
large as greatly to interfere with the function of the organ it
occupies, and according to the nature of this organ will be the gravity
of the affection.When, however, the flesh or other parts of animals affected with
measles or hydatids containing active scolices are used as food in a
raw or insufficiently cooked state, the meats are digested in the
stomach and the scolices liberated to pursue their further development.Passing into the small intestine, the active scolex everts its head
from its caudal sac, which atrophies and disappears, and the parasite
attaches itself to the mucous membrane, and rapidly develops and grows
into the conspicuous and familiar form of the adult tape-worm.The
duration of life of the latter while maintaining its position in the
intestine is uncertain, but under favorable circumstances it commonly
continues for years, and thus, with the incessant production of ripe
segments charged with eggs, it becomes a constant focus of infection.*       *       *       *       *

Three species of tape-worm in the mature condition are common parasites
of man, living in the small intestine.They are the Taenia saginata,
Taenia solium, and Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SAGINATA.--SYNONYMS: Taenia mediocanellata; Beef tape-worm;
Unarmed tape-worm; Fat tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus saginata; Beef measle-worm.This, which is now regarded as the most common tape-worm of man, is
named the beef tape-worm because it is derived from the beef used as
food.In the mature condition it lives only in the small intestine of
{934} man, and in the juvenile condition it lives in the ox.Its
frequency is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of eating
beef in a raw or insufficiently cooked state, conjoined with the
careless habit of leaving human excrement in pastures where it is
accessible to cattle.The mature beef tape-worm is commonly observed as a soft,
yellowish-white, thickish, band-like worm, ranging from six to twenty
feet or more in length.The head, about the size of a yellow
mustard-seed, is rounded quadrate and provided with four equidistant
hemispherical suckers.Succeeding the head is a short, slightly
narrower, flattened neck, which merges into the gradually widening and
segmented body.The segments, at first narrow fore and aft and several
times wider than the length, become successively larger,
proportionately longer, more distinct, and quadrate in outline; and
finally the length may exceed the breadth two or three times.A
full-grown tape-worm may possess twelve hundred segments and more, and
specimens are recorded as reaching a length of thirty feet.The larger
segments measure from a quarter of an inch to an inch long and from
three to four lines wide.The larger or riper segments exhibit on one
border, irregularly alternating on the two sides, at or near the
middle, a papilla in which is the external aperture of the genital
apparatus.In the fully-ripe segments the uterus, distended with eggs,
may be obscurely seen through the wall of the body, but is rendered
more visible by drying the segments, moderately compressed, between two
pieces of glass.It appears as a long, narrow, white or brownish median
line or tube, giving off laterally numerous short, transverse, more or
less branching tubes.The worm in its usual position lies along the course of the intestine
in loose coils, and exhibits lively movements, alternately shortening
and elongating, expanding and contracting the head, and protruding and
retracting the suckers.The ripe segments spontaneously detach
themselves, and may be found scattered along the large intestine ready
to be discharged with the excrement, or, as is sometimes the case, they
may spontaneously creep from the anus.Rarely more than a single worm
infests a person at the time.According
to Perroncito, quoted by Cobbold, a mature worm was reared from a beef
measle, swallowed by a student, in fifty-four days.It is estimated that the number of eggs in the mature segments of the
beef tape-worm amounts to about 35,000.As the full-grown worm may
consist of 1200 segments, and there is reason to believe these are
renewed several times annually, we learn that the whole number of eggs
produced by a single individual is enormous.The ripe segments,
attached to the parent or becoming spontaneously detached, lay their
eggs in the intestine to be discharged with the feces.When more or
less emptied they shrink and appear reduced in size, and in this
condition are expelled or spontaneously creep from the anus.If the
ripe segments are forcibly expelled and are alive, they will lay their
eggs in the feces externally.The ripe eggs are brown, oval, about 0.03
mm.long, and have a thick shell, with an outer vertically striated
envelope.As previously intimated, the common source of the beef tape-worm in man
is the use of raw or insufficiently cooked beef affected with measles.The ox becomes infested by swallowing the eggs, or, it may be, even the
entire segment, of a tape-worm deposited with feces in the {935}
pastures of cattle.The measles usually occur in the muscles, including
the heart, though they have also been noticed in the liver and lungs.They appear, in beef, as oval, whitish bodies from the size of a
mustard-seed to that of a pea.They consist of a sac of connective
tissue containing the larval tape-worm or cysticercus.Measles under
ordinary circumstances are seldom noticed in beef, and when they occur
are commonly few in number.According to the latest authorities--Leuckart, Cobbold, Stein, and
others--the beef tape-worm is the most common of the cestodes which
infest man.Until within about thirty years it was generally not
distinguished from the pork tape-worm, and this was accordingly
regarded as the most common human species.Since the writer distinctly
recognized the beef tape-worm within the last twenty years, all the
specimens of Taeniae, from people of Philadelphia and its vicinity,
that have been submitted to him for examination--perhaps in all about
fifty--have appeared to belong solely to Taenia saginata.The
prevalence of this species with us is no doubt due to the common custom
of eating underdone or too rare beef, while the pork tape-worm is
comparatively rare, as with us pork is only used in a well-cooked
condition.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SOLIUM.--SYNONYMS: The Pork tape-worm; Solitary tape-worm; Armed
tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus cellulosae; Pork measle-worm.Until a recent period this species was generally regarded as the most
common tape-worm of man--a view which in great measure was due to the
circumstance that the beef tape-worm was not distinguished from it.It
was called the solitary tape-worm, still expressed by the specific
name, from the impression that it rarely occurred otherwise than single
at a time in a person.This has also proved to be incorrect, likewise
due to the two kinds of tape-worms having been confounded together; for
while the beef tape-worm most commonly occurs solitary, the pork
tape-worm not unfrequently occurs with several together.The species is now appropriately named the pork tape-worm, as
indicating its common source--pork used as food.The frequency of the
parasite is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of using pork
in a raw or imperfectly cooked state, conjoined with that of depositing
excrement where it may be accessible to hogs.In the mature condition
the pork tape-worm is peculiar to man and lives in the small intestine,
but in the larval condition, though especially infesting the hog, it
also occasionally infests man, and lives in any organs of the body, but
mostly the muscles, liver, and lungs.The mature pork tape-worm, as commonly seen, is a soft white, thin,
band-like worm, from five to ten feet long and about four lines where
widest.The head is spheroid, about the size of that of an ordinary
pin, and smaller than that of the beef tape-worm.It is furnished with
four hemispherical cup-like suckers, and the summit forms a blunt
papilla armed with a double circle of twenty-five or twenty-six hooks.The neck is narrow, thread-like, about an inch long, and merges into
the segmented body, which gradually widens to the extent mentioned.The
segments, at first much wider than long, as they successively enlarge
also become more distinct and proportionately longer, so that the more
{936} posterior ripe ones are as long as they are wide, and often
longer, though not to the same degree as in the beef tape-worm.The
genital papilla, with its external aperture, is marginal as in the
latter.The fully-developed uterus is quite distinctive in character
from that of the beef tape-worm.The median tube is coarser, and the
lateral branches are likewise coarser, much fewer--half the number or
fewer--less branched, and less crowded.The ripe and often
spontaneously detached segments are commonly longer than broad, more or
less elliptical in outline, with truncated ends, and usually measure
about half an inch in length by about a third in breadth.The ripe eggs
resemble those of the beef tape-worm, but are usually spheroid in
shape.The common source of the pork tape-worm is pork affected with measles
eaten in the raw or insufficiently cooked state.The hog becomes
affected with measles when it has access to human excrement containing
eggs and ripe segments of the tape-worm, which it eats with avidity.The eggs, with their already developed embryos, when swallowed, undergo
the same series of transformations and course as those indicated in the
account of the beef tape-worm.Pork affected with measles is much more
common than beef affected in the same way, and is frequently a subject
of ordinary observation.From the difference in habit of the hog and ox
this is what might have been suspected; and the fact that the beef
tape-worm is more common than the pork tape-worm is to be explained
from the circumstance that fresh beef is in more general use than pork,
and is usually employed less thoroughly cooked.The pork measles are commonly seen as round or oval, hard, whitish
bodies, from the size of a hempseed to that of a pea, imbedded in the
connective tissue of the muscles or flesh.The measle consists of a sac
of connective tissue enclosing the scolex or larval tape-worm, which
resembles that of the beef tape-worm, but differs especially in the
possession of a double circlet of hooks to the head, as in the adult
worm.The scolex has long been known, and was regarded as a distinct
parasite, with the name of Cysticercus cellulosae.When fresh pork
measles are swallowed by man they are digested in the stomach, and the
cysticercus or scolex is released and passes into the small intestine.Here, attaching itself to the mucous membrane by means of its suckers
and crown of hooks, it rapidly develops and grows into the adult
tape-worm.In this condition it lies in loose folds along the
intestine, to which it clings so tenaciously that commonly the neck
gives way when the greater part of the worm is forcibly detached by the
use of medicines.Fragments, consisting of the more mature segments,
frequently appear detached from the posterior part of the worm, and the
fully-ripe segments may be seen scattered singly in the course of the
large intestine.The isolated segments are thinner and more translucent
than those of the beef tape-worm, and in this condition are discharged
with the feces, but may also spontaneously creep from the anus, though
seldom as compared with the other species.Experiments repeatedly made by swallowing pork measles prove that the
mature tape-worm may be developed in the course of three months.The
length of life attained by it under favorable circumstances is
uncertain, but it probably continues a dozen years or more.The scolex of the pork tape-worm, or the cysticercus, so common in the
hog, is also less frequently a parasite of man, and in this condition
is a {937} more potent agent of danger than in its ordinary or mature
state.The infection is due to the introduction of eggs or mature
segments of the tape-worm into the stomach--a circumstance which may
readily occur through handling these objects and transferring them to
the mouth, or more rarely perhaps by their transference from the
intestine into the stomach through vomiting.In the measle form the parasite may occur in any organ of the body, but
is mostly found in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue.Its
pathological significance depends on its number and position.Located
in the nerve-centres, it may occasion the most serious consequences.Usually it occurs in small numbers and gives rise to no obvious
inconvenience, and is only accidentally detected in dissection after
death.It appears to maintain its vitality for some years, but finally
dies, and undergoes degradation.Only when it can be detected in such
position as the interior of the eye or beneath the conjunctiva can the
patient be relieved by surgical aid.Elsewhere, even if its presence is
suspected, it is ordinarily beyond the reach of medical treatment.The
writer a few years since, in dissecting the body of a <DW52> man to
illustrate his lectures on the muscles, found two living measles, of
which one was in the diaphragm and the other in the transversalis
muscle of the abdomen, but none were detected elsewhere.The parasite
unquestionably gave no inconvenience to its host during life.*       *       *       *       *

Other species of Taenia which have been observed as parasitic in the
human intestine are mostly of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA CUCUMERINA, the common tape-worm of the dog, and TAENIA
ELLIPTICA, the common tape-worm of the cat, are very much alike in
appearance, and are regarded by many authorities as the same species.They occur frequently in considerable numbers in these animals, living
in the small intestine.They have also been occasionally found in man,
especially children.It is a comparatively delicate worm, chain-like in appearance, ranging
from four inches to a foot in length.The head is provided with four
suckers and a prominent rostellum armed with about sixty hooks.The
neck and anterior part of the body are thread-like.The mature segments
are elliptical in outline or like a melon-seed, whence the name.There
is a double set of sexual organs, and a genital orifice occupies the
middle of both lateral margins of the segments.The ripe segments
become readily detached and creep actively in the intestine, and are
either expelled with the feces or they spontaneously creep from the
anus.The eggs are comparatively few and measure 0.05 mm.Late researches appear to show that the eggs adhering to the hair about
the anus or elsewhere are eaten by lice of the same animals, and within
these insects undergo further development.The dog and cat,
subsequently swallowing the lice, infect themselves with the mature
worms.Thus also persons, especially children, from too great
familiarity with these animals, directly or through their food, may
likewise become infected.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA NANA, the Dwarf tape-worm, has been observed but once.It was
discovered by Bilharz, in Egypt, in a boy who died of meningitis.It
{938} is a little worm, about half an inch in length, and occurred in
large numbers in the duodenum.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA TENELLA.--This is another small species, which has been but once
observed.It is described by Cobbold, who suspects it to be derived
from measles of the sheep.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA FLAVOPUNCTATA is also a small species, from eight to ten inches
long, with ripe joints about one millimeter long and from one and a
half to two millimeters broad.It is described by Weinland, and has
also been but once observed.A half-dozen specimens were discharged
from a healthy child, of nineteen months, in Boston, Mass.Since the above was written the author has had the opportunity of
examining some little tape-worms which he suspects to be of the same
kind as the former.They occurred in the practice of T. V. Crandall in
Philadelphia, and were expelled from a child of three years of age
after the use of santonin.About a dozen fragments appear to have
pertained to three worms, from twelve to fifteen inches in length.The anterior part of the body is thread-like, the
posterior part about two and a quarter millimeters wide.The width of
the joints is more than twice the length.The ripe joints are pale
brown, and are remarkable for the comparative simplicity of the uterus,
which is distended with brown eggs.A peculiarity of the worm is the
repeated but irregular alternation of fertile with sterile joints.[1]

[Footnote 1: _Amer.of Medical Sciences_, 1884, p.The species is probably more common than might be supposed, and from
its small size, and perhaps harmless character, has generally escaped
notice.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA MADAGASCARIENSIS.--This species, described by Davaine, is
imperfectly known.Fragments of the worm have been twice observed in
the Comoro Islands.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS LATUS.--SYNONYMS: Dibothrium latum; Taenia lata; Broad
tape-worm.This tape-worm, of another genus than the preceding, is a common
parasite of man in certain localities of Europe, but has not been found
as an indigenous product elsewhere.It occurs especially in Sweden and
Russia, East Prussia, Poland, and West Switzerland.In the latter
country it prevails to such an extent that it is reported that about
one-fourth of the inhabitants of Geneva are thus infested.Among the
tape-worms submitted to the writer from time to time for identification
a few years ago was a large specimen of Bothriocephalus latus, but it
proved to have been derived from a Swede who had arrived in this
country only a few months previously.There are many species of Bothriocephalus, which in the adult condition
mainly live in fishes.The genus is distinguished from Taenia by many
points, chiefly in the form and construction of the head, the form of
the joints and uterus, and the position of the genital aperture, which
is situated centrally on one of the broad surfaces instead of the
lateral margin.{939} The broad tape-worm is the largest of the tape-worms infesting
man, a full-grown specimen reaching to twenty-five feet in length with
a breadth of three-fourths of an inch, and consisting of upward of four
thousand segments.It is a soft, grayish, flat, band-like worm, with
head, neck, and segmented body holding the same proportions as in the
other tape-worms.The head is elongated, clavate, and is provided with
a long, narrow, elliptical sucker on each side.The narrower neck is
short and merges into the segmented body, which gradually widens to
half an inch or more.As the segments successively enlarge, they
increase proportionately to a greater extent in breadth, so that their
width for the most part measures from two to four times their length.A
few toward the end of the series become narrower and longer than those
in advance.In the ripe segments the uterus, distended with brownish
eggs, forms a central rosette-like group of pouches.The genital
aperture is central in the broad surface of the segments, and is always
on the same or ventral side.The broad tape-worm inhabits the small intestine, and is usually found
single, but occasionally several together, and sometimes also in
association with one or both the other common tape-worms.The species
is also reported to be not infrequent in the dog.Ripe portions of the broad tape-worm become detached in fragments of
variable length, to be discharged with the feces.The partially-emptied
appearance of the uteri in these fragments indicates the laying of the
eggs previous to the expulsion of the latter.The eggs are oval, of a
light-brown color, and measure about 0.07 mm.The shell at one
pole is furnished with an operculum or lid for the escape of the
embryo.This is developed subsequently to the discharge of the eggs
from the intestine.If the eggs are placed in water, in the course of
some months the embryos are developed and escape from the shell.The
embryo is a round or oval body furnished with three pairs of spicules,
as in that of the Taeniae, but differs in possessing a ciliated
envelope, by means of which it freely swims about in the water.After
some days the embryo discards its envelope and creeps about in an
amoeboid manner.Further than this, until recently, the fate of the
embryo was unknown.Petersburg, after determining the
presence of scolices of Bothriocephalus in the muscles, liver, and
organs of generation of the pike, trout, and eel-pout, by feeding these
to cats and dogs succeeded in rearing worms which differed in no
respect, except in being smaller, from the Bothriocephalus latus of
man.Such being the case, it becomes evident that man may ordinarily
become infested with the parasite by eating raw or insufficiently
cooked fishes of the kind mentioned.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CORDATUS, described by Leuckart as a common species
infesting the dog in Greenland, has been reported as having once been
found in a woman.Bottger regards it as not distinct from
Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CRISTATUS.--This species, but once observed, is
described by Davaine.It was passed by a child in Paris, and the worm
was upward of nine feet in length.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS OF TAPE-WORMS.--Whichever may be the species of {940}
tape-worm infesting the human intestine, the symptoms to which it gives
rise are mainly of the same character, modified of course in degree by
the size and number of the parasites and the susceptibilities of the
patient.Clinging by means of the head to the mucous membrane of the
intestine, and involved among the valvulae conniventes and villi, the
worm may extend in loose folds along the greater part of the course of
the intestine or lie coiled in an elongate mass.Besides being rendered
evident from time to time by the discharge of segments or fragments,
the beef tape-worm especially sometimes introduces itself to the notice
of its host through the segments creeping from the anus.Sometimes
segments of tape-worms are vomited, especially in women; and the
exhibition in this way, especially of the pork tape-worm, is to be
deplored, for should segments be retained in the stomach the patient
becomes further liable to be affected with measles or cysticerci.Some persons continue infested with a tape-worm a long time without
suspecting its existence and with little or no inconvenience, and
perhaps first become aware of its presence by the accidental discovery
of segments discharged from the bowels.Usually, however, the parasite
creates more or less disturbance, and not unfrequently occasions great
discomfort.The symptoms are both local and of a general nature.Itching at the extremities of the alimentary canal and various
dyspeptic symptoms are common; uncomfortable sensations in the abdomen,
uneasiness, fulness or emptiness, feeling of movement attributed to the
worm, and colicky pains; disordered appetite, sometimes deficient,
oftener craving; paleness, discoloration around the eyes, furred
tongue, fetid breath, and sometimes emaciation; fulness of the
forehead, dull headache, buzzing in the ears, twitching of the face,
and dizziness; often uncomfortable feelings in the abdomen increased by
fasting, which are temporarily relieved by taking a full meal.Certain
kinds of food also at times appear to produce greater uneasiness,
apparently due to more than usual disturbance of the parasite.Symptoms
of a more grave character are sensations of fainting, chorea, and
epileptic fits.Others of a chlorotic and hysterical character are not
unfrequent, especially in women, who also may suffer more or less from
uterine disorder.All the ordinary symptoms are quickly relieved by the expulsion of the
tape-worm--permanently if it is entirely removed, but temporarily, as
is frequently the case, when only the greater bulk of the parasite is
discharged and the head continues to remain securely attached to the
intestine and ready to renew its many-segmented body.The tape-worms
are capable of a wonderful amount of extension from traction without
detachment; and from the delicacy of the neck and the anterior part of
the body, and the action of medicine on the peristaltic motion of the
intestine, the posterior part of the worm, including its great bulk, is
most apt to be torn away and discharged, while the head remains.So
long as this is the case, and the worm has not been poisoned or killed,
the anterior portion grows, and thus the parasite is renewed and
accompanied by a return of all the former symptoms.Under the
appropriate treatment the evacuations of the patient should be
carefully inspected, so as to satisfy both physician and patient that
the parasite has been completely expelled.To properly examine the
evacuations, they should be repeatedly drenched with clear water, and
the sediment, after the settling {941} of the washings, must be
inspected.It is only when the physician has seen the head of the
parasite that he can reasonably ensure his patient a permanent cure.*       *       *       *       *

TREATMENT.--To get rid of tape-worms many remedies have been employed,
though comparatively few retain a reputation for positive success.Some
act by powerfully operating on both bowels and worms, producing the
detachment and discharge of the latter without killing them, as is
often indicated in the lively movements they exhibit after their
expulsion.Others poison and kill the worms, and also cause their
detachment and expulsion from the bowel.Before the administration of the appropriate medicine for tape-worms,
with the object of rendering it more effective it is advisable to bring
the alimentary canal into a condition which will render the parasites
most vulnerable.For this purpose fasting is to be recommended for
several days previously, and when food is used it should be in moderate
quantity, and of such a character as to leave little residue to
accumulate in the intestine.Wheat bread, the ordinary meats, milk and
coffee, are best, while the usual vegetables should be avoided.One of the most effective remedies is the oil of turpentine in the dose
of one or two fluidounces, made into an emulsion with white of egg and
sugar; children require about half the quantity.The large dose is less
apt to produce the usual objectionable effects of that medicine than
small ones.The only inconvenience caused by it is the heat of the
stomach, some febrile excitement, and fulness of the head or headache
lasting for one or two days.The effects are more apt to occur when the
medicine does not act as a cathartic.The oil usually operates quickly,
killing the worm and producing its discharge.If it does not act in the
course of two or three hours, a full dose of castor oil may be given,
and, if necessary to aid the action of this, enemata may be employed.To ensure the purgative action of the oil of turpentine it may be
advantageously associated with the castor oil, of each a fluidounce
made into an emulsion.Another and effective remedy is the root of the male fern, Aspidium
filix-mas, used in decoction or electuary.Stein of Frankfort
recommends the ethereal extract as the best preparation, and prescribes
it in doses of from seven to ten grammes, enclosed in half the number
of gelatin capsules and administered at short intervals within half an
hour.It should be taken in the morning fasting, after taking a cup of
coffee, swallowing the capsules with the aid of a second cup.Half an
hour after the capsules are taken a mixture of castor oil, brandy, and
ginger syrup, of each fifteen grammes, should be administered.The
treatment has proved all that could be desired, and the worm, including
the head, is discharged altogether, rolled into a ball.The bark of the pomegranate-root, Punica granatum, is also a powerful
and efficient remedy, but often proves very disagreeable from its
producing violent pains in the abdomen, with nausea and vomiting.It
also generally purges, occasioning the discharge of the worm.Kuchenmeister prefers it to any other medicine, given in the form of
decoction prepared by macerating three ounces of the fresh bark in
twelve fluidounces of water for twelve hours, and concentrating the
infusion by gentle heat to one-half.He recommends it to be taken after
fasting a day and the {942} administration at night of two fluidounces
of castor oil.It is to be given in three or four doses within an hour.Should the medicine not purge, it should be followed by another dose of
castor oil.Recently, Feraud has recommended the tannate of pelletierin, the
alkaloid of which is derived from the pomegranate-root, as the most
powerful of remedies for tape-worm, the dose for an adult being
one-half to three-fourths of a grain.The patient should fast a day on
bread and milk, and the following morning, before rising, take an
infusion of one-third of an ounce of senna.This should be followed an
hour later by half the medicine diffused in a little water, and the
patient should remain quiet in bed to avoid nausea and vomiting.Half
an hour later the rest of the medicine is to be given, followed in
another half hour by a dose of castor oil.Should there be no stool
after an hour, purgative enemata may be used.In one case twelve beef
tape-worms were discharged together measuring, collectively, fifty
meters.Kousso, the flower of Brayera anthelmintica, an Abyssinian herb, has
been of late much employed as a remedy for tape-worms, but with many
physicians of experience it has lost favor.Heller speaks of it highly,
and recommends it to be taken in the morning, an hour after the patient
has taken coffee.The dose is from half an ounce to an ounce, and is
conveniently taken in compressed balls or disks, coated with gelatin,
and swallowed at intervals in the course of an hour, aided by mouthfuls
of coffee.Any disposition to vomit should be repressed, which is
rendered easier by taking small mouthfuls of strong coffee or pieces of
ice.Koussin, an alcoholic preparation of kousso, is also efficient, and has
the advantage over the latter that it does not occasion nausea.It has
been used in the medical clinic of Munich in the dose of 30 grains, and
it has been a very rare occurrence that the result was not all that
could be desired.The seeds of the common pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo, are extolled by many
physicians as a remedy for tape-worms; and the writer has twice had the
opportunity of observing large specimens of the beef tape-worm which
were expelled after the administration of this medicine.The dose is an
ounce of the seeds bruised into a paste and made into an emulsion.It
should be taken in the morning, fasting, and followed in an hour or two
with a full dose of castor oil.Santonin, a principle derived from santonica, Artemisia maritima, is
reported as a remedy for tape-worms, but its efficacy has also been
denied.The dose is from two to four grains for an adult, and from
one-quarter to one-half a grain for children over two years.It is best
administered in lozenges prepared with sugar and tragacanth.The quinia sulphate has also been recommended as an effectual remedy
both in tape- and seat-worms.As regards the prophylaxis of tape-worms, there are some important
points to which we direct attention.The evacuations of patients containing tape-worms, their segments and
eggs, should not be carelessly thrown away, at least in places
accessible to animals which may become infected.They should be treated
with boiling water, the heat of which is sufficient to kill all animal
parasites.The handling of living tape-worms and segments should be
avoided, as eggs {943} which may adhere to the hands, if transferred to
the mouth and swallowed, will produce infection.Meats visibly infested with measles are not fit and should not be used
as food.Raw meat should altogether be discarded as food, both for the
sick and well, and all meats should be thoroughly cooked.As a rule,
meat should not be used so long as it appears red or on cutting emits a
bloody liquid.A large piece of meat requires long boiling or roasting
for sufficient heat to penetrate to the interior to destroy any
parasites that may be present.Even salted meats and hams should be
cooked to ensure against parasitic infection.It is important also to
avoid food prepared by uncleanly persons who may be infested with
tape-worms.As regards our domestic animals, which are the common source of the
infection of man with tape-worms, they should also be protected from
infection as far as possible.This is to be done by preventing them
from having access to human excrement.As Heller remarks, with this
object the barbarous custom of defecating in every place promiscuously
should be put down with a high hand.[2]

[Footnote 2: Several years since a physician of Texas sent to the
writer a piece of pork, making inquiry as to its condition, and stating
that all the pigs of his vicinity were diseased and their flesh
similarly affected.It contained a number of measles or larval
tape-worms.On giving the information and the probable cause of the
affection of the pigs, the doctor reported in return that there was not
a privy in his village.Until our people are more careful with the
raising of pigs, European governments will have reason for prohibiting
the importation of our pork.]*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ECHINOCOCCUS.--SYNONYM: Hydatid tape-worm.Larval condition: Echinococcus; E. hominis; E. veterinorum; E.
granulosis; E. scolicipariens; E. altricipariens; E. hydatidosus; E.
multilocularis; E. cyst; Hydatid; Hydatid cyst; Acephalocyst.This tape-worm, in its mature state the most insignificant looking of
its kind, though not strictly an intestinal worm of man, in the
juvenile condition is one of his most dangerous parasites, as being the
source of hydatid tumors.The adult tape-worm lives in the small
intestine of the dog and wolf, in some localities often existing in
these animals in thousands together.From its diminutive size it may be
readily overlooked, concealed or obscured by the villi among which it
is suspended to the mucous membrane.It is about a fourth of an inch in
length, and consists of but four segments, of which the last alone
exhibits the ripe condition.The head resembles in construction that of
the pork tape-worm, being provided with four suckers and a prominent
crown, with from thirty to fifty hooks arranged in a double circle.The
terminal ripe segment exceeds in size all the preceding together, and
before it separates from the series another is ready to take its place.The ripe eggs contain the usual six-spined embryo as in other
tape-worms.The mature worm is remarkable for the comparative shortness of its
life, which, according to Siebold, is about seven weeks.Apparently to
compensate for the small number of its segments, the larval form is
endowed with the power of multiplying itself to a wonderful degree.It is only in the larval condition that the hydatid tape-worm infests
man, and in this state also it infests the ape, the ox and sheep and
other ruminants, also the horse, hog, and indeed many other animals of
the same class.{944} If the eggs of the tape-worm are swallowed, which may readily
happen by too free intimacy or association with infested dogs, the
liberated embryos obtain access to the intestine.Penetrating the
mucous membrane, the embryos thence may migrate to any part of the
body.From the comparative frequency of hydatid tumors in the liver we
may suspect they mostly enter the portal venous system and take the
course of the blood-current.It is, however, probable that they migrate
directly to their destination, for hydatid tumors are also frequently
seated in the neighboring organs and the abdominal walls.The embryo
tape-worm, once fixed in position, becomes the starting-point of a
hydatid tumor.When dogs are fed on the liver, or other parts affected with hydatid
tumors, from the sheep or other animals, the scolices are liberated,
and, passing into the small intestine, are there developed into the
mature tape-worms.Hydatid tumors occur in any of the organs of the body, but are more
frequent in the liver than in all others together.They are common in
the lungs, kidneys, spleen, omentum, and subperitoneal tissue of the
abdominal walls.They are less common in the heart, brain, spinal
canal, the pelvic viscera, and the bones.Mostly but a single tumor is
found in the same person, but occasionally several occur together in
the same or in different organs.There are several varieties of the hydatid tumor.In man the more
common form consists of a cyst or a group of cysts enclosed in a
connective-tissue envelope induced by the presence of the parasite.The
simple cyst is produced through the transformation of the echinococcus
embryo, and the group of cysts is derived from the former by
proliferation; and hence the first has been called the parent cyst, and
the others the daughter cysts.These also in the same manner may
produce a third series, called granddaughter cysts.The parent cyst, at
first spherical, becomes modified in shape according to the space it
occupies and the resistance to which it is subjected, thus assuming an
oval, lobulated, or other form.It may increase in size to that of a
cocoanut or larger, and may remain simple, but usually is compounded by
proliferation in the production of daughter cysts.These may be few or
many up to hundreds, and range from a minute size up to that of a
walnut, and are spherical or modified in shape by mutual pressure or
other cause.The cysts are filled with a clear watery liquid of saline
taste, but without albumen.The hydatid cysts are usually composed of an outer thick, translucent,
homogeneous, laminated, glistening, highly elastic membrane, the
ectocyst, and an inner thin, granular, and cellular layer, the
endocyst.From the endocyst originate minute buds, which become the
brood-capsules of the larval worms or scolices.These form little
groups of a few to a dozen individuals suspended within the
brood-capsules, but capable of eversion from them.The individual
scolices, which appear to the naked eye as mere white points, have the
form and construction of the head-segment of the mature Taenia
echinococcus.After death or by violence they become easily detached,
and then float free in the liquid containing them.In some cases the
echinococcus cysts develop no scolices, in which condition they
constitute acephalocysts.Occasionally the echinococcus embryo
undergoes imperfect development, constituting the multilocular hydatid
tumor, rarely found elsewhere than in the liver.{945} Echinococcal tumors, especially those which have many daughter
cysts, when accessible are remarkable for exhibiting a tremulous
movement when grasped by the hand and quickly tapped with the finger.Infection through the embryonic form of the Taenia echinococcus, as the
source of hydatid tumors, is productive of the most disastrous
consequences, and has ended in the destruction of many lives both of
men and domestic animals.The parasite is not directly productive of
suffering, but its effects and dangers are proportioned to the size of
the tumor it occasions and the character and importance to life of the
organ in which the latter is situated.With the increase of the hydatid
tumor, usually of very slow growth, it encroaches upon the surrounding
parts, and if these are not displaced they become disorganized and
atrophied.The liability and frequency of infection with the hydatid disease
appear to be proportioned to the prevalence of intimate association
with the dog.In Iceland, in which it is said every peasant owns half a
dozen dogs, which share his dwelling with him, it is also reported that
one-sixth of all the deaths are due to the hydatid parasite.Ordinarily, the hydatid disease is beyond the reach of medical
treatment.The mercurials and potassium iodide have been recommended,
but the results are very doubtful.Apparently as an indication how
little hydatid parasites may be influenced by medicine, the following
incident will show: The writer once received for dissection the body of
an English sailor which had been injected with zinc chloride for
preservation.In the abdominal wall in the right iliac region there was
a hydatid tumor the size of a fist.On examination of the tumor it was
found full of daughter cysts, and these contained living scolices,
though the man had been dead several days and the tissues were bleached
by the zinc solution.Favorable results in the treatment of hydatid tumors are only to be
expected through surgical means when they are accessible.As a prophylactic measure against infection the avoidance of too
intimate association with dogs is especially to be recommended.In concluding the chapter on Taenia echinococcus, as a prophylactic
against this and other parasites Cobbold gives the advice that "all
entozoa which are not preserved for scientific investigation or
experiment should be destroyed by fire when practicable, and under no
circumstances whatever should they be thrown aside as harmless refuse."*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ACANTHOTRIAS.Larval condition: Cysticercus acanthotrias.This species has been but once observed, and only in the larval
condition or that of the scolex, which was first described by Weinland.About a dozen specimens were found by Jefferies Wyman of Boston in the
body of a woman of Virginia who died of phthisis.They were situated in
the connective tissue beneath the skin and in the muscles, except one,
which was attached to the dura mater.The scolex is distinguishable
from that of the other human tape-worms in possessing a triple circle
of hooks.{946} The Trematodes, or Fluke-worms.The trematodes or fluke-worms, though allied to the tape-worms, differ
in many important characters.In the mature condition, like the latter,
they are solid worms or are devoid of a body cavity or coelum, and are
with rare exceptions hermaphroditic.They are, however, never compound,
but simple or consist of single individuals, and are provided with a
mouth and alimentary canal, but this is closed or is without an anal
aperture.They have a water vascular system, communicating with the
exterior by a pore at the posterior extremity of the body.They are
commonly of flat, elliptical shape, with a sucker-like mouth at the
fore end, and with a second sucker situated ventrally near the middle.The fluke-worms are remarkable for their successive transformations and
course of life, and, like the tape-worms, they pass the different
stages of their existence in different animals.A number of species
have been described as infesting man, but most of them are,
fortunately, of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HEPATICUM.--SYNONYMS: Fasciola hepatica; Liver-fluke.This species, the common liver-fluke, occasionally occurs in the human
body, but is especially frequent in the sheep and other ruminating
animals, as the ox, goat, and deer, and it likewise occurs in the
horse, hog, and some other animals.It usually inhabits the liver,
occupying the bile-ducts, but is also sometimes found in the portal and
other veins and in the intestine, and more rarely in abscesses beneath
the skin.It is the cause of the affection in sheep called rot, of
which many thousands die annually.The liver-fluke is a flat, tongue-shaped, brownish worm about an inch
long and about half as wide.It is invested with minute scale-like
spines.The head end is somewhat prolonged, and terminates in a small
oral sucker, a short distance behind which is a small ventral sucker.The intestine is forked and much branched.The genital aperture is
situated between the oral and ventral suckers.The commonly yellowish
eggs are numerous and large, oval, and measure about 0.135 mm.The common liver-fluke frequently occurs in large numbers, even
hundreds, in the liver of the sheep, obstructing the bile-ducts and
occasioning more or less destruction of the organ.The eggs pass off
with the bile into the intestine, and are discharged with the
excrement.In water the eggs are hatched, and deliver a ciliated and
freely-swimming embryo.This in favorable positions, such as marshy
pastures, obtains access to small fresh-water snails and penetrates to
the interior of their body.Here the embryo sheds its ciliated
integument and is transformed into a sporocyst.This is an elliptical
pouch containing reproductive bodies, which become developed into
individuals of more elongated form than the sporocyst, provided with a
mouth and stomach, and named redias, or nurses.The nurse penetrates to
the liver of the snail, and there develops within itself new forms
called cercarias, which resemble the parent fluke-worm, but are
provided with a long, powerful tail and have no apparent generative
apparatus.The cercaria escapes through an aperture of the nurse, and
makes its way out of the snail into the water, where it swims about
actively by means of the tail, much in the manner of a tadpole.{947}
The cercaria after a time fixes itself to a submerged plant, becomes
encysted, shakes off its tail, and remains in a quiescent state.If in
this condition, in the feeding of sheep or other animals, the tailless
cercaria or incipient fluke-worm is transferred to the stomach, it
makes its way to the liver, and there grows and is developed into the
sexually mature worm.Recently it has been ascertained both in England and Germany that the
juvenile state of the fluke-worm is passed especially in the little
fresh-water snail Lymneus truncatulus.As, however, the common
liver-fluke occurs in America, while the last-named species of Lymneus
does not, it is rendered probable that the juvenile condition of the
parasite also occurs in other species of snails.Incidentally, the
writer may here mention that he has found certain of our smallest
fresh-water snails, such as Planorbis parvus, frequenting meadows in
the vicinity of our rivers and creeks, swarming with nurses of several
different species of fluke-worms.Notwithstanding the frequency of the common liver-fluke in the sheep
and other domestic animals, its occurrence has been rare in man, and in
all the cases reported it has been few in number, either single or from
two to half a dozen.In man it has been found to occupy the bile-ducts,
the portal vein, and abscesses beneath the skin.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM LANCEOLATUM.--SYNONYM: Smaller Liver-fluke.This species, much smaller than the preceding, is of lanceolate form,
acute behind, smooth, and about a third of an inch long.Its suckers
are moderately large, and the bifurcate intestine is unbranched.It
infests the liver of the sheep and ox and some other animals, and not
unfrequently is found in association with the former species.It
usually does not occur in such great numbers together as in the latter;
from which and other circumstances, as the smaller size and smooth
investment, it does not produce the same serious results.Its
continuous history remains unknown, though it is probable that its
course is similar to that of the common liver-fluke.Several cases are
reported of its occurrence as a parasite in man.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM SINENSE.--Under this head Cobbold has recently described a
species somewhat larger than the D. lanceolatum.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CONJUNCTUM.--Another species described by Cobbold under this
name, originally found in the liver of an American fox, has also been
detected in man.The worm is about one-fourth of an inch long.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS.--Cases of fluke-worms in the human liver have occurred so
rarely that we are not prepared to indicate with certainty what may be
the nature of the peculiar symptoms.If the parasites were numerous,
they would give rise to more or less obstruction of the bile-ducts,
with accumulation of bile, accompanied with jaundice and other symptoms
usually attendant on functional disturbance of the liver.As in sheep,
they would occasion dilatation of the bile-ducts, catarrhal
inflammation, incrustation with biliary matters, hyperplasia of the
surrounding {948} tissues, and more or less disorganization and atrophy
of the secretory structure.TREATMENT.--As regards the treatment, we can say almost nothing.In the
destructive disease of rot in sheep there are no known means to expel
the parasites from the liver.If present in man, as they occur but few
in number, we may hope for their spontaneous expulsion in due time
without leaving any serious result.As a means of prophylaxis persons
should carefully avoid salads prepared from subaquatic vegetables, like
cress, which may harbor little fresh-water snails.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HETEROPHYES.--This is a small species, about half a line long,
with the fore part of the body covered with minute spines, and having a
large, nearly central, ventral disk.It has been but once observed, and
was reported by Bilharz, in Cairo, as having been found, in the
post-mortem examination of a boy, in the small intestine, in which it
existed in hundreds.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CRASSUM.--This is the largest of the fluke-worms infesting
man, and measures from one to three inches in length.It is elliptical,
comparatively thick, and smooth.The two suckers have nearly the same
relative size and position as in the D. hepaticum.It inhabits the
duodenum, and has been observed a number of times infesting inhabitants
of China and India.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM RINGERI.--A species by this name, about half an inch long, has
recently been described by Cobbold as infesting the lungs of people in
Formosa and China.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM OPHTHALMOBIUM.--A minute species, described under this name,
has been detected several times in the human eye.*       *       *       *       *

BILHARZIA HAEMATOBIA.--SYNONYM: Distomum haematobium.As a human parasite this is the most important of the fluke-worms,
being the most common and dangerous.It is apparently restricted to
Africa and Arabia, and is especially frequent in Egypt, Abyssinia, the
Cape of Good Hope, and Natal.So far as known, it is peculiar to man
and monkeys, and inhabits the veins, especially those of the portal
system, and it lives on the blood.The blood fluke-worm is remarkable among its kind in having the sexes
distinct.The female is slender, cylindrical, and tapering toward the
ends, looking more like an ordinary thread-worm than a fluke-worm, and
is about three-fourths of an inch long.The male is about half an inch
long, but wider than the female, which it partially embraces at
maturity by doubling upon it laterally.This parasite, of the same essential nature as the more ordinary
fluke-worms, is most probably introduced in the juvenile condition into
the stomach by drinking unfiltered standing waters, and perhaps also by
eating vegetables which grow in wet places and upon which the young
fluke-worms may be encysted.From the stomach the worms gain access to
the portal venous system, within which they undergo development to
sexual maturity.The worms, proportioned to their number, {949}
occasion more or less sudden and dangerous haematuria.According to
Bilharz, who first discovered the parasite, it also induces
inflammation of the ureters, bladder, and rectum, accompanied with
ulceration and incrustations and concretions in the same, due to the
abundant deposit of eggs in the mucous membrane.The symptoms in the
haematuria are obvious; all treatment fails, but the prophylaxis is
evident.*       *       *       *       *

AMPHISTOMUM HOMINIS.--The genus Amphistomum is distinguished from
Distomum in having the ventral disk placed at the posterior extremity
of the body.A species has been recently described by Cobbold under the above name,
and is reported as having been observed several times in natives of
India.It is a red worm, about the fourth of an inch long, and inhabits
the caecum and ascending colon, in which it was found in hundreds
together.The mucous membrane exhibited venous congestion and was
marked with numerous red spots resembling leech-bites, produced by the
parasites.One of the patients died of cholera.We have too little information as to the symptoms induced by this
parasite, and of its treatment, to say anything.It is probable that
calomel, turpentine, and castor oil would be appropriate remedies.Several other fluke-worms which have been reported as having been found
in the human body are generally viewed with doubt as to their
genuineness.Such are the Hexathyridium pinguicola, from a tumor of the
ovary; the H. venarum, said to have been found in the blood and in the
sputum of haemoptysis; and the Tetrastomum renale, said to have been
found in the urine.The Acanthocephali, or Thorn-head Worms.The thorn-head worms in the mature condition are comparatively robust
cylindrical worms, with a body-cavity or coelum, but devoid of mouth
and alimentary canal.They are provided with a protrusile and
retractile proboscis-like head armed with circular rows of recurved
hooks, by which they firmly cling to the wall of the intestine of their
host.There are many species, which mostly in
the mature state live in fishes.In the juvenile or larval condition
they live in other animals, mostly crustaceans and insects.It is
doubtful whether any species naturally infests man.*       *       *       *       *

ECHINORHYNCHUS GIGAS.--The great thorn-head worm is a common parasite
of the hog, living in the small intestine.It is a large white worm,
the female of which reaches a foot in length, while the male is about
one-third the size.It is doubtful whether it occurs as a human
parasite, though a worm less than the fourth of an inch found in a man
in Prague has been attributed to this species.The Nematodes, or Thread-worms.The nematodes, or thread-worms, are slender, cylindrical, and
inarticulate, and usually more or less tapering toward one or both
extremities.{950} They have a distinct coelum or body-cavity, with
thick muscular walls limited by a transparent elastic, chitinous
integument, which is sometimes more or less distinctly and regularly
transversely wrinkled.The alimentary canal extends the length of the
coelum, with the mouth at the anterior extremity, and usually an anus
at or near the posterior extremity.In some forms in the mature
condition the intestine is atrophied and the anus absent.The sexes are
distinct, and commonly the male is very much smaller than the female.The organs of generation occupy the coelum along the sides of the
intestine.The female aperture is commonly situated ventrally near or
in advance of the middle of the body, while the male aperture is at or
in the vicinity of the anus.Mostly, the worms are oviparous, but many
are viviparous.The development is direct, and usually the
transformations are inconspicuous, so that the embryos mostly differ
but little from the parent, except in the absence of the generative
apparatus.*       *       *       *       *

OXYURIS VERMICULARIS.--SYNONYMS: Ascaris vermicularis; Seat-worm;
Pin-worm; Maw-worm; Maggot-worm; Thread-worm; Ascarides.The seat-worm is the most common intestinal parasite of man, prevails
everywhere, and is peculiar to him.It is a lively, wriggling creature
which inhabits the small and large intestines and feeds on their
contents.It frequently occurs in large numbers together, and in such
cases incessantly makes its appearance, associated with multitudes of
eggs, in the evacuations.The female, which is ordinarily seen alone in the greatest abundance,
is a white cylindrical worm tapering toward both extremities.The head
end is thickened, and is provided with three prominent labial papillae
enclosing the mouth.The posterior end extends from the anal aperture
in a long and straight, narrow, conical, sharp-pointed tail.The double
uterine tube, distended with eggs, terminates in a vagina, the external
aperture of which is situated ventrally near the anterior third of the
body.The smaller male hardly tapers behind, but is incurved and ends
in a short, blunt, conical tail.The penis is a single chitinous
spicule, the end of which is usually seen projecting from the cloacal
aperture.The young seat-worms, in various degrees of growth and development, and
the mature males are chiefly to be met in the lower portion of the
small intestine, while the pregnant and mature females chiefly occupy
the caecum.The seat-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that a single
ripe female contains from 10,000 to 12,000 eggs, and these, it is
suspected, may be renewed several times before her functions become
exhausted.From time to time the ripe females proceed along the large
intestine to the rectum, in which position they lay most of their eggs.These are discharged, together with many of the worms, in the feces.The eggs are ovoid in shape and about 0.05 mm.After they are
laid under favorable conditions the embryos are rapidly developed.The investigations of the helminthologists of the day make it appear
that it is necessary that the eggs of the seat-worm should be swallowed
{951} and pass through the stomach, in which the embryos are freed,
before they can undergo development to sexual maturity.Moreover,
observations go to show that infection may, and probably ordinarily
does, occur from eggs scratched from the anus and conveyed to the mouth
directly or by being applied to food from uncleanly hands.It is
evident that itching of the anus, induced by the presence of the
parasites in the rectum, often accompanied by itching of the nose and
lips, may lead to alternate scratching of the parts and the
transference of eggs from one to the other.Thus, too, uncleanly nurses
who may be infested with seat-worms after scratching may handle food
and infest children under their charge.Children are commonly more
liable to the parasites than others, no doubt from the circumstance
that they are less capable of avoiding the conditions favorable to
infection.Seat-worms prevail in all conditions of society, but their
prevalence is largely proportioned to the more or less uncleanly
habits.Persons sleeping with others infested are liable to infection,
especially if they are uncleanly and in the habit of eating in bed.Obvious hints to avoid the parasites are obtained by regarding the
statements thus given.SYMPTOMS.--The presence of a few seat-worms is usually attended with no
obvious inconvenience, and they may remain unnoticed unless
accidentally observed in the evacuations.The symptoms occasioned by
them are in great measure proportioned to their quantity and the
susceptibility of the patient.The most prominent symptom is excessive
itching of the anus; often trifling or even absent during the day, it
becomes very annoying and distressing in the evening or during the
night.This periodic change appears to be due to the movement of the
worms to the rectum, apparently induced by the position and repose of
the patient and the increased warmth of the body in bed.Under these
circumstances the patient attempts to relieve the incessant itching by
scratching, and often by boring with the finger in the anus.In this
way eggs become adherent to the finger-nails, under which they have
been repeatedly detected, and may thus be inadvertently transferred to
the mouth.Occasionally, some of the worms wander from the anus, and in
women may thence penetrate into the vulva.The itching of the anus may
induce more or less sexual irritation, which in the young may further
lead to onanism and its attendant evils.Other symptoms of the presence
of the parasites are itching of the nose and lips, restlessness in
sleep, grinding of the teeth, startings, twitchings, and general
nervous disturbance.When the worms are very numerous they may produce
intestinal catarrh, with discharges of mucus, pain, and diarrhoea.In
children especially they may give rise to more serious nervous
symptoms, as epileptic fits and chorea.TREATMENT.--Generally, persons are readily relieved of seat-worms.Epsom salt alone or with senna as a purgative, repeated once or twice,
often answers to completely expel them.Castor oil, also alone or with
a few drops of the oil of turpentine or of wormseed, is also an
effectual remedy.The tincture of aloes, in the dose of from half a
fluidounce to two fluidounces, once or twice repeated, the writer has
found to fully answer the purpose.Besides the purgatives, medicated
suppositories, in obstinate cases injections of olive oil, and enemata
of a solution of castile soap introduced by means of an elastic tube,
so as to wash out the entire length of the large intestine, may be
employed.*       *       *       *       *

{952} ASCARIS LUMBRICOIDES.--SYNONYMS: Round-worm; Long round-worm;
Maw-worm; Lumbricus.The round-worm is the largest of the nematodes which ordinarily infest
man, and is second only in frequency to the seat-worm.It is a
well-known parasite, and prevails everywhere in all conditions of
society.It is less lively in its movements than the seat-worm, and is
remarkable for possessing a peculiar disagreeable odor, which is
independent of the medium in which it lives.It inhabits the small
intestine and feeds on the contents.It also infests the hog and the
ox.The round-worm is cylindrical, reddish or brownish, and tapering toward
both extremities.The head end terminates in three prominent labial
papillae surrounding the mouth, and the tail end is short and conical.The female, as commonly seen, ranges from six inches to a foot in
length, and is about a fourth of an inch in thickness.The ovarian
tubes are long, thread-like, and tortuous, and, with the shorter,
nearly straight, and wider uterine tubes, contain many millions of
eggs.The genital aperture is situated ventrally near the anterior
third of the body.The male is about half the size of the female, but
is capable of considerable extension, and the tail end is incurved.The
penis consists of a pair of slender, clavate, chitinous spicules, the
ends of which protrude from the cloacal aperture at the root of the
tail.The round-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that the
genital tubes of a large mature female contain the enormous number of
60,000,000 of eggs.The ripe eggs are laid in the intestine, and are
discharged with the evacuations in great numbers, and often in
considerable masses together.They are oval, about 0.05 mm.in length,
and are provided with a thick shell and an additional tuberculate
albuminoid envelope, usually  by the intestinal contents.The eggs of the round-worm after being expelled from the body are very
tenacious of life, and under ordinary favorable circumstances they may
remain in a condition capable of development for several years.Experiments have shown that they have great power in resisting the
destructive influences of heat and cold, dryness, and the agencies of
decomposition.In water and moist earth they have been retained alive
for a year or two.When ripe eggs are placed in water the development
of the embryo is observed to proceed very slowly, and is only completed
after five or six months.The embryo while still contained within the
egg sheds its skin and becomes provided with a tooth-like spine to the
head end.The smallest examples of reputed round-worms found in the
human intestine measured only about a line in length.The further history of the round-worm is unknown, nor has it yet been
positively ascertained in what manner man becomes infected with the
parasite.Repeated experiments, not only on the hog and other animals,
but on man himself, go to show that he is not directly infected by
swallowing the recently-laid ripe eggs.It is rendered probable that
the eggs are swallowed by some common but yet unknown minute aquatic
animal, within which the embryo may undergo further development, and in
this condition may be swallowed by man in drinking-water.In
confirmation of the view that man becomes infected in the latter way,
Davaine remarks that the "people of Paris, who drink only filtered
{953} water, are rarely infected with the round-worm, which is
otherwise the case in the rural districts of France."The round-worm is most prevalent in warm climates, and especially among
the less-civilized peoples.The better classes among the more
enlightened nations suffer comparatively little from the parasite, and
it is the lower classes, especially the ill-fed and uncleanly, who are
most afflicted.It is exceedingly frequent in the Orient, in Africa,
the West Indies, and Brazil.Most commonly, only a few round-worms--one, two, three, up to a
dozen--occur together in the same person, but they often occur in
considerable number, even to several hundreds.Not unfrequently they
are found in association with seat-worms.They are more frequent and
usually occur in greater abundance in children, perhaps in a measure
due to the circumstance that they are less able to discriminate the
conditions favorable to infection and avoided on other grounds by
adults.The natural and ordinary habitation of the round-worm is the small
intestine, especially the jejunum, and it commonly only occurs in the
large intestine, mostly dead, on the way to be discharged with the
evacuations.Under disturbing circumstances, as the character of
certain irritating food, the parasite is disposed to become restless
and wander from its usual position.Not unfrequently it enters the
stomach, and thence may ascend to the mouth or nose, and perhaps the
first intimation of the presence of such an unwelcome guest is in its
expulsion from the mouth.From the pharynx the worm may enter the
larynx and trachea, or advance farther into the air-passages, giving
rise to the usual symptoms of foreign bodies in these parts.Occasionally the parasite forces its way through the bile-ducts into
the liver and gall-bladder, creating disturbance in those organs
proportioned to the number and size of the worms and the extent of
their progress.In the liver it may occasion inflammation and the
formation of an abscess attended with all the usual symptoms of
hepatitis.It has been reported that it may penetrate the intestinal
wall and enter the peritoneal cavity, but it is generally regarded as
doubtful whether the worm can do so in a healthy state of the
intestine, but only where there may be ulceration or other similar
condition.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms indicating the presence of the round-worm in
the intestine vary with its numbers and with the age and susceptibility
of the patient.In general, the presence of one or two worms is
unattended with any marked disturbance, and is mostly unsuspected until
the parasite is accidentally seen in the discharges.The ordinary
symptoms are disordered appetite (usually increased), flatulence,
hiccough, foul breath, dyspepsia, abdominal pains, itching at the
extremities of the alimentary canal, furred tongue, darkening of the
eyelids, and emaciation.The nervous symptoms are restlessness in
sleep, unpleasant dreams, starting in fright, grating of the teeth, and
muscular twitchings.In more aggravated cases, especially in children,
epileptic fits may occur.If the parasites are numerous, they produce
diarrhoea with copious mucus discharges, and may induce enteritis with
all its attendant symptoms.When the worms wander into the stomach,
they induce colic, nausea, retching, and vomiting, all of which
disappear with the expulsion of the parasites.TREATMENT.--The remedies employed for seat-worms often serve to {954}
expel the round-worm, and not unfrequently the two are discharged
together.Wormseed, or the seed of Chenopodium anthelminticum, has been
a favorite remedy for the round-worm, especially in children.The dose
in these cases is one or two scruples of the powdered seeds in
electuary with syrup or molasses, administered in the morning before
breakfast and at bedtime for three or four days.It should be followed
by calomel or other brisk cathartic.The volatile oil, in the dose of
from five to ten drops in emulsion, may be used in the same manner.A much-extolled remedy to destroy and get rid of the round-worm is
santonin, given in doses of from one-third to one and a half grains
three or four times a day, the larger dose being used only for adults.It should be followed by a purgative, for which a dose of castor oil
answers a good purpose.*       *       *       *       *

ASCARIS MYSTAX, the common round-worm of the cat and dog, has been
reported as occasionally infesting man.It resembles the former
species, but is much smaller, commonly from one to four inches in
length, and has the head end furnished with a pair of lateral narrow,
wing-like expansions of the integument.It inhabits the small
intestine, and when present in man would no doubt induce symptoms like
those of the ordinary round-worms which infest him.*       *       *       *       *

TRIOCEPHALUS DISPAR.--SYNONYMS: Long thread-worm; Whip-worm.The long thread-worm is a not unfrequent intestinal parasite of man,
though rarely observed unless specially sought, as it ordinarily gives
rise to little or no disturbance.It is common in England, Southern
Europe, and the Orient.Davaine reports that half the cases of persons
investigated in Paris were infested with it; it also occurs in this
country.It inhabits the lower end of the ileum, the caecum, and
vermiform appendix, and feeds on the intestinal contents.It commonly
occurs in small numbers, two or three to a dozen, occasions no evident
inconvenience, and is rarely discharged with the evacuations.The long thread-worm is yellowish-white and cylindrical, with the
anterior half or more of the body attenuated in a hair-like manner.The
female reaches about two inches in length, has the tail end conical,
and the anus subterminal.The male is about two-thirds the length of
the former, has the thicker portion of the body enrolled, and the tail
end blunt.The eggs are laid in the intestine and discharged with the
feces.The subsequent history of the parasite and its mode of infecting
man remain unknown.Only in cases where long thread-worms are numerous do they give rise to
trouble.According to Leuckart, Pascal gives as constant symptoms of
the presence of large numbers of the parasite, headache, redness of the
face, prominence of the eyes, small, irregular, and intermittent pulse,
and pains in the lower part of the abdomen.The usual remedies addressed to the seat-worm and round-worm will most
probably be equally applicable to the long thread-worm.*       *       *       *       *

LEPTODERA STERCORALIS.--SYNONYMS: Anguillula stercoralis; Rhabditis
stercoralis.{955} This is a minute nematode worm recently observed infesting French
soldiers in Cochin China.It is about half a line in length, and
inhabits the small and large intestine, and also penetrates into the
biliary and pancreatic ducts.It occurs in myriads and occasions
diarrhoea and dysentery.Another species, Leptodera intestinalis,
nearly three times as large, has been noticed in smaller number
associated with the former.The eggs of these worms are laid in the
intestines, and both together are discharged in multitudes with the
feces.They are probably introduced into man by drinking stagnant
water, and undergo complete development after passing through the
stomach.It is probable that the remedies employed in the treatment of the
familiar seat-worms and round-worms would be equally efficacious in the
expulsion of these parasites.*       *       *       *       *

ANCHYLOSTOMUM DUODENALE.--SYNONYMS: Strongylus duodenalis; Dochmius
duodenalis; Sclerostoma duodenale.This intestinal parasite, first noticed in Milan by Dubini in 1838, is
of more dangerous character than any of the nematode worms previously
described.In Europe, besides Italy, it was frequently observed among
the workmen of the St.It is exceedingly common in
Egypt, and Bilharz found it in nearly all his post-mortem examinations
of bodies.It probably prevails to a considerable extent in most
tropical countries, including the East and West Indies and Brazil.There is also reason to suspect, from the nature of the affection it
induces, that it may exist in the Southern States.The Anchylostomum is a red, cylindrical worm, with the anterior
extremity tapering and recurved.The head end, somewhat enlarged,
encloses a capacious oral capsule armed with strong hook-like teeth.The caudal extremity of the female ends in a conical point, and the
genital aperture is situated behind the middle of the body.The caudal
extremity of the male ends in a trilobate pouch, within which projects
the bispiculate penis.The female is from five lines to three-fourths
of an inch long; the male is about half the size.The eggs are oval and
measure 0.05 mm.The worm inhabits the small intestine, especially the duodenum and
jejunum, clinging tenaciously to the lining membrane by means of the
armed mouth.It penetrates the mucous membrane to the submucous coat,
from which it sucks the blood that forms its food.In the position of
its attachment it gives rise to little ecchymoses.It often occurs in
large numbers, even to hundreds and thousands.The eggs are laid in the
intestine and are discharged with the evacuations.Externally, in
water, the embryo undergoes development within the egg, and then
escapes to lead for some time an independent existence.Subsequently,
it is most probable that the worm obtains access to the human stomach
by drinking standing water, and completes its development in the
intestine.The Anchylostomum proves to be a prolific source of wasting diseases in
tropical countries, and is pernicious to an extent proportioned to the
numbers infesting the intestine.By depriving the body of blood it
produces a greater or less degree of anaemia.The affection begins very
insidiously, and the general nutrition of the body may not be visibly
disturbed {956} until a late period.In moderate cases the disease is
indicated by general paleness of the skin and mucous membranes, fatigue
on slight exertion, and a tendency to palpitations and quickened pulse.In more severe cases there is constantly increasing debility, with
increase of paleness, indisposition to exertion, excessive sleepiness,
and feeling of coldness.Dyspeptic symptoms sometimes appear, and loss
of appetite may alternate with ravenous hunger.Accompanying this there
is often a disposition to eat innutritious articles, as coal, clay,
wool, etc.Feeling of weight and oppression in the epigastrium and
abdominal pains are frequent.In the advance of the affection shortness
of breath appears, increased on exertion to violent dyspnoea.Emaciation becomes obvious in the later stage of the disease.In the
worst cases the symptoms increase in severity, the patient becomes
dropsical, is attacked with profuse diarrhoea and vomiting, and finally
dies.The severity of the affection is proportioned to the number of
parasites present and the quantity of blood they consume and cause to
be lost.Bad cases may end fatally in a few weeks, but generally the
disease lasts for months, and where the patient is provided with
abundance of good food it may continue for years.The prognosis of the disease is rather unfavorable; if, however, the
nature of the affection is ascertained before it has greatly exhausted
the patient, and the parasites can be expelled, the result should be
favorable.We have thus far obtained but little information as to the best
treatment for Anchylostomum.Calomel and turpentine have been
recommended, and, as these are most powerful vermicides, we have reason
to believe they would prove most effectual remedies.In regard to the prophylaxis for Anchylostomum--and we may add in
general for all parasites which gain entrance to man through
drinking-water--all stagnant or standing waters should be filtered, so
as to remove any source of infection, whether by eggs or free embryos
of parasites or of larval forms existing within minute aquatic animals
which serve as intermediate hosts to parasites.Standing waters, such
as those of puddles, ditches, marshes, and ponds, more or less swarm
with minute animals, all of which may be entirely removed by
filtration.Even the water of cisterns and wells, if supplied from the
free surface of the country, may not be free from minute animals, and
especially eggs, and therefore requires filtration to be safe.Only
spring and freely-running water of rivers and creeks and of lakes is
commonly free from microscopic animals and their eggs, and therefore
devoid of all danger in these respects.*       *       *       *       *

STRONGYLUS LONGEVAGINATUS; S.bronchialis.--This nematode has been only
once satisfactorily observed.Many occurred in the lungs of a boy in
Germany, but the real cause of his death was not stated.The female
worm is about an inch long, the male about five-eighths of an inch.Certain worms previously discovered in the bronchial glands of a case
of phthisis, and described under the name of Hamularia lymphatica, are
regarded by Cobbold as the same with the former; but the descriptions
of the two render this improbable.Treutler's drawing of Hamularia, as
copied by Leuckart, looks like an Ascaris upside down.*       *       *       *       *

{957} EUSTRONGYLUS GIGAS; Strongylus gigas; Palisade-worm;
Kidney-worm.--This worm, recorded in the catalogue of human parasites,
is doubtful as such.Pertaining to the same family as Anchylostomum, as
the common name indicates its usual habitation is the kidney.It is the
largest of the nematodes, and is a long, cylindrical red worm, slightly
tapering, and blunt at the ends.The mouth is enclosed by six rounded
labial papillae.The caudal extremity of the male ends in an inverted
cup-like pouch, from which the penal spiculum protrudes.The female
commonly ranges from one to three feet in length and from a fourth to
nearly half an inch in thickness.The male ranges from six inches to a
foot in length and from one to three lines in thickness.The mature parasite is common in many fish-eating mammals, from which
it is inferred that fishes are the intermediate host for the juvenile
condition of the worm.It is frequent in the wolf, dog, mink, weasel,
raccoon, otter, and seal.It also occurs in the hog, and is reported to
have occurred in the horse, ox, and man.Usually it is solitary, and
occupies one of the kidneys coiled upon itself.Under its influence the
kidney is atrophied and reduced to the condition of a capsule of
connective tissue, often containing bony spicules.It feeds on blood
and on the purulent matter resulting from the inflammation it produces.The worm is occasionally found in other positions, as the mesentery,
the abdominal cavity, the intestine, liver, urinary bladder, and lungs,
but perhaps in most of these cases has been derived from its usual
habitation.In this country the writer has repeatedly observed the
kidney-worm in the mink, the dog, and the wolf.In one instance in the
former animal he found a female and a male associated together in one
kidney, which was reduced to the condition of a fibrous capsule
containing in its wall a large radiated plate of bone.The cases on record of the occurrence of this formidable parasite in
man are of very early date, and are mostly doubtful as to the authentic
nature of the worm, and are all unsatisfactory as to the attendant
phenomena.*       *       *       *       *

TRICHINA SPIRALIS.--The trichina, or flesh-worm, a minute nematode, is
a common parasite of man, and from its wide prevalence and results may
be regarded as the most dangerous of all.Perhaps from the earliest
ages it has been dealing death freely and indiscriminately to our kind
without its existence having been suspected until within the last
half-century.Frequently, the affection, now named trichinosis,
produced by its presence has been so prevalent in communities as to
appear epidemic.The parasite was first discovered, and is commonly
observed, as a little worm coiled up and imbedded in the flesh of man.In the same manner it is frequently seen in the flesh of the hog.In
the adult or mature state it lives in the small intestine of both man
and the hog, but its duration of life in this position is comparatively
brief.Trichinosis, or the disease induced by the introduction of trichinae
into the intestinal canal and the migration thence into the voluntary
muscles, varies in symptoms and gravity with the number, condition, and
position of the parasites and the susceptibility of the patient.The
presence of trichinae in the alimentary canal, though often accompanied
by violent symptoms, is comparatively free from danger, whereas in the
muscular {958} system they not only produce the greatest suffering, but
often the most disastrous results.Man is ordinarily infected with the trichina by eating the raw or
insufficiently cooked meat of the hog, or pork in any of its varieties
of food.Infected meat often contains immense numbers of the parasite,
a single ounce at times being estimated to contain from 50,000 to
100,000 worms.The trichina was first distinctly noticed in the muscles of the human
body by Paget in 1835, and was described by Owen with the name it now
bears.It was subsequently observed under the same circumstances by
other investigators.In 1846 the parasite was found by the writer in
the muscles of the hog, but neither he nor others for some time
afterward suspected the significance of the discovery.In 1860, Zenker
of Dresden treated a supposed case of typhus complicated with excessive
muscular pain and oedema.On post-mortem examination the muscles were
found swarming with trichinae, and to these the affection altogether
was attributed.Nearly at the same time the investigations of Leuckart
confirmed the relationship of the parasites as the cause of the
disease.In 1862, Friederich first diagnosticated the affection and
experimentally determined the presence of the worms in the living
patient.The trichina is also found infesting other animals of the same class
besides man and the hog, especially the rat, mouse, rabbit, cat, and
fox.Experiments further prove that mammals are generally more or less
susceptible to infection with the parasite, though some appear to
resist its extension to the muscular system, as in the case of the dog.The horse, ox, and sheep exhibit little disposition to artificial
infection of the muscles, and hence from this circumstance and the
nature of the food of these animals they are rarely found to be
infested with trichinae.In experiments on birds and lower classes of
animals, though trichinae were ascertained to advance in development in
the intestine, they failed to invade the muscular system.Ordinarily, it appears that while man is infected with trichinae
through the hog, this animal becomes infected by eating infested rats,
mice, and cats, fragments of waste pork, and perhaps occasionally by
feeding on the excrements of infested animals.The trichinae occupying the muscles are immature, and it is only after
they are swallowed and the parasites are freed by digestion of the
envelopes and pass into the intestine that they undergo development to
sexual maturity.In this state the female is viviparous and gives birth
to a multitude of active embryos, which immediately commence to migrate
to the muscular system.As it is estimated that each female may give
birth to upward of a thousand embryos, it is readily conceived to what
an extent the body may become infested from eating a few ounces of
trichinous pork.The immature or larval trichinae are also distinguished as muscular,
and the sexually mature ones as intestinal, trichinae, in accordance
with their position in the two principal conditions.Muscular trichinae vary in condition from the embryo, which works its
way among the muscular fibres or has obtained entrance into these, to
the coiled-up worm lying quiescent in a capsule imbedded among the
muscular fibres.Infected flesh in the early state is scarcely distinguishable as such
with {959} the naked eye, but in old cases the trichina capsules become
imbued with calcareous matter, and are thus rendered visible as minute
white or grayish specks scattered through the red meat.In the recent state of invasion the worms are found free among the
muscular fibres or within these.Later, they appear mostly solitary and
at rest, coiled within a fusiform mass of semi-liquid granular matter
resulting from the degradation of the muscular substance.Subsequently,
they become enclosed in an elliptical capsule, apparently derived from
the myolemma of the muscular fibre they had entered.The capsules,
situated among the bundles of sound muscular fibres, are arranged with
their long diameter parallel with the latter.The trichina capsules
commonly measure about one-fifth of a line long, and the coiled worm
within is scarcely a half-line long.If muscular trichinae remain with their host, after a year or more they
exhibit signs of decay.Commonly, little fat-globules appear at the
poles of the capsules, and these become the seat of calcareous deposit.Finally, the worms die and undergo degeneration.When meat with living trichina capsules is swallowed, the freed worms
pass into the intestine, and here in the course of four or five days
reach maturity.The adult intestinal trichina is a minute, filiform white worm, thicker
behind and tapering forward.The female is about an eighth of an inch
long, and has the genital aperture at the anterior fourth of the body.The male is little more than half the length of the former, and has the
caudal end provided with a pair of conical processes, between which is
the genital aperture.The ripe female trichinae give birth to living embryos, and continue
the function for about a month, after which they appear exhausted,
ordinarily die, and disappear from the intestinal canal.The new-born
embryos, about 1/200 of a line long, quickly leave the intestine to be
disseminated throughout the body.Penetrating the mucous membrane, they
probably enter the blood-vessels to be carried onward by the
blood-currents, and perhaps also, in part, directly migrate to their
destination in the muscles.The latter mode of progress is rendered the
more probable from the circumstance that the muscles contiguous to the
intestinal canal, as the diaphragm and those of the abdominal walls,
are commonly most abundantly infested with the parasites.In the
muscles of the limbs they are sometimes noticed to predominate toward
the extremities of the former, as if retarded in their course by the
tendinous connections.It would appear that muscular trichinae, to be capable of producing
infection--that is to say, of further development--must have reached a
certain stage, corresponding with the encapsulated condition, before
they are swallowed.In this stage they may remain within their host
probably for a year or two.Children seem to suffer less in proportion to the quantity of
trichinous meat they eat than adults, and they appear less susceptible
to muscular invasion of the parasites.The difference is probably in a
measure due to the greater susceptibility of the intestinal canal and
the consequent production of more copious diarrhoea in children, with
more complete expulsion of the worms.SYMPTOMS.--In general, the effect produced by eating trichinous meat
{960} is proportioned to the number and condition of the trichinae
ingested and to the susceptibility of the patient.A few of the
parasites may pursue their entire career and die within their host
without ever exhibiting any obvious evidence of their presence.Sometimes the symptoms of trichinosis are obscure or trifling,
sometimes sufficiently well marked, but moderate, and often they are
more or less striking and violent.The period of incubation of the
affection varies from a few hours to a week or more, and the duration
of the disease also varies--both in a measure proportioned to the
number and condition of the parasites.In mild cases of trichinosis the patient may pass through the course of
the disease without being confined to bed, and in a few weeks may be
regarded as convalescent.The majority of cases pursue a slow course of
from six or seven weeks to three or four months.A fatal termination is
frequent, and is most common from the fourth to the sixth week, and
appears mainly to be due to the loss of respiratory power.Fatal cases
rarely happen after the seventh week.From a few hours to a few days after eating trichinous meat the patient
may be seized with dyspeptic symptoms--nausea, cardialgia, flatulence,
eructations, and vomiting.These may be accompanied with complete loss
of appetite, excessive thirst, bad taste, and fetid breath.There is
also commonly a feeling of general uneasiness, with fulness of the
forehead or headache, and feeling of weakness and fatigue to exhaustion
or complete prostration.Neuralgic pains are felt in the abdomen and
limbs, and the muscles generally are more or less relaxed and flabby.Violent disturbance of the alimentary canal occurs only when large
quantities of active trichinae are taken with the food.The subsequent
symptoms, due to invasion of the muscular system, may, but do not
necessarily, accord in degree with the former.Diarrhoea usually comes on early, and the evacuations, at first more
consistent, become thin and clay-, like those of typhus or like
the rice-water stools of cholera.In the severest cases the patient may
die in this stage from extreme exhaustion and with all the appearance
of cholera.Sometimes the diarrhoea subsides and gives place to
obstinate constipation.The muscular symptoms induced by the invasion of the trichinae may be
trifling or moderate, varying to a most violent character.They
commonly appear after a week, and later up to the sixth week.The
muscles become more or less swollen, hard and tender to the touch, or
highly painful under pressure.Motion is extremely painful, and the
patient usually lies in a helpless state with the limbs flexed--adults
on the back, children on the side.Difficulty, with pain, in chewing
and swallowing ensues, and even complete trismus, due to the presence
of the parasites in the muscles of mastication and deglutition.Difficulty of breathing also arises from the presence of the trichinae
in the respiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm and those of the
larynx.Even movement of the eyes is painful, due to the parasites in
the orbital muscles.Bronchial catarrh comes on early, attended with
hoarseness and asthmatic cough.Fever may be absent in mild cases of trichinosis, but is considerable
in the severer forms, though not in the first few days.The pulse
accords with the increase of temperature.Profuse sweating is a common symptom of the affection, commencing {961}
early and continuing throughout.Generally there is considerable
decrease in the quantity of urine, which is highly <DW52>.Adults suffer with insomnia, while the reverse state prevails in
children, who commonly lie in a soporose condition.Formication and
dilatation of the pupils are frequent symptoms.Oedema is a characteristic and pathognomonic symptom of trichinosis,
and is seldom so slight as to escape attention.It commonly appears in
the eyelids and face about the end of the first week, and may disappear
after several days, to recur after several weeks.It usually commences
in the limbs in the second week, and is more marked and persistent, and
increases, especially in severe cases.Peritoneal and pleuritic irritation and inflammation, with bronchitis
and pneumonia, are not unfrequent complications in the more aggravated
form of trichinosis.Most cases of the disease reaching the seventh week advance in
convalescence, while those of mild character by this time have
recovered, except from the weakness and emaciation, which remain as
evidences of serious illness.Trichinosis in children is distinguished by greater mildness, less
danger, abundant oedema, less muscular pain, a dormant condition, and
more rapid convalescence.The distinct recognition of trichinosis is difficult in isolated cases,
but becomes more evident where it occurs in numbers, as in an entire
family or in large portions of a community.The proof that the patient
has partaken of trichinous pork helps to establish the diagnosis.In the beginning of severe cases of the affection symptoms of a more or
less violent gastro-intestinal catarrh are commonly present, often
associated with slight fever and almost invariably excessive
perspiration.Muscular lameness, both in mild and severe cases, is an
early symptom.The disease is distinguished from cholera by the profuse
perspiration and the peculiar muscular symptoms; from ordinary
rheumatism by the gastro-intestinal catarrh and general exhaustion.With the appearance of oedema of the eyelids and face at the end of a
week the diagnosis becomes more certain.The further progress of the
affection is so characteristic that its distinction can scarcely remain
in doubt.The general prostration, the violent muscular symptoms, the
bronchial catarrh, the hoarseness and dyspnoea, the profuse sweating,
and the sleeplessness, render the case pretty clear.In the prognosis of the disease no positive conclusion can be derived
from the severity or early appearance of the initial symptoms.Commonly, the more speedily they occur and the more violent they are,
the less favorable will be the prognosis, while the later they appear,
the more propitious it is.Long-continued diarrhoea is especially
unfavorable, while a profuse diarrhoea at the beginning is to be viewed
as a fortunate event.The prognosis is more favorable in cases in which
sleep and the appetite are maintained, and in those in which the
disturbance of the respiratory organs is slight.A favorable
termination of the affection is the rule with children.TREATMENT.--The treatment of trichinosis is not generally promising in
favorable results.No means have yet been discovered to destroy or
remove trichinae which have migrated from the intestinal canal.While
{962} the parasites continue within the latter we may have reasonable
hope of expelling them from the body by means of the usual remedies for
intestinal worms.Experience, however, with these remedies has not been
in accordance with expectations.In the mean time, until some more
potent vermicide is discovered applicable to the destruction and
removal of trichinae from the intestine, we are disposed to place most
reliance on such purgatives as oil of turpentine and castor oil and
calomel and jalap.Subsequently, a good nutritive diet with wine is
recommended to preserve the life of the patient until the affection has
reached that period when the parasites become capsulated and there is
no longer danger from them as irritants.As a preventive of trichinosis, besides the avoidance of pork or its
varied preparations of ham, sausages, etc.when it is known or
suspected they may be infested, thorough cooking of meats is a certain
means.A boiling temperature surely kills all animal parasites, but
care is requisite that large pieces of meat should be cooked
sufficiently long that the desired heat may extend to the interior
throughout.The writer may add that it was in a slice of boiled ham,
from which he had partly made his dinner, that he first discovered
trichina in the hog.*       *       *       *       *

Of the nematode worms there are many species of comparatively long,
slender proportions, which constitute the family of Filaridae.As
parasites they rarely occupy the interior of the intestinal canal,
except by way of transit, and live in most other organs and tissues of
the body of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA MEDINENSIS.--SYNONYMS: Dracunculus; D. medinensis; Medina-worm;
Guinea-worm.The Medina-worm has long been recognized as a parasite of man, and by
competent authorities has been regarded as the fiery serpent which
afflicted the children of Israel in the wilderness of Judea.It
prevails in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia, and thence has
been introduced into tropical America.It is ordinarily observed as a
long, white, cord-like worm, situated beneath the skin in any part of
the body, but mostly in the lower limbs, and especially in the vicinity
of the ankle.Though a frequent parasite, only the female is known.In
the mature condition it is nearly uniformly cylindrical, and ranges
from eighteen inches to three or four feet in length and less than a
line in thickness.The head end is rounded and furnished with a little
papillate plate, in the centre of which is situated a minute oral
aperture.The caudal end is conical and incurved.The intestinal canal
is atrophied and without an anal aperture.The coelum is mainly
occupied by a capacious uterus filled with free embryos.A generative
aperture appears also to be absent, and the young can only escape by
rupture of the parent.Experiments made about a dozen years since in Turkestan by Fedschenko,
at the suggestion of Leuckart, have shown that when the embryos of the
Medina-worm are introduced into water containing the familiar little
crustacean cyclops, they penetrate into this, and within it undergo
transformation into the larval stage.The subsequent history of the
larval worms remains unknown, but from what we have learned of the
history of many parasitic worms it is reasonable to suppose that if
{963} the infested cyclops is swallowed in drinking-water, it may
explain the presence of the mature worm in the human body.The young
worms, liberated from their crustacean host by digestion in the
stomach, probably enter the intestine, and thence migrate to their
destination.In the young condition, advancing to maturity, the worms
have been found in all parts of the body except within the cranium and
eyeball.They appear to migrate in the course of the least-resisting
connective tissues, along the route of the principal blood-vessels,
until they reach the surface of the body.Usually, a single worm is found in a person, though cases occur where
several, to a dozen or more, are present.Commonly, the parasite is
solitary, though two or three may be associated together.When deeply
seated the Medina-worm ordinarily produces but little discomfort,
though in some cases its movements are accompanied with more or less
severe pain.It also gives rise to inflammation and the formation of an
abscess, in the purulent matter of which the worm lies bathed.The
removal of the worm, when accessible, by the proper surgical aid is
followed by complete relief.It is evident that filtration of the drinking-water would be a certain
prophylaxis for the Medina-worm.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA SANGUINIS.--SYNONYMS: Filaria sanguinis hominis, Lewis; F.
sanguinolenta; F. Bancrofti, Cobbold.Another species of Filaria, a more dangerous parasite of man and
indigenous to the tropics, is of frequent occurrence, though of
comparatively recent discovery.It has been observed in India, Africa,
Brazil, and the West Indies.It is commonly seen in the embryonic
condition, living in the blood of patients affected with elephantiasis
and certain other diseases, and is also found in the urine.In this
early condition it is a minute worm, scarcely more than the 1/100 of an
inch in length, and occurs together in immense numbers.In the sexually mature condition the female filaria is a white
hair-like worm three or four inches in length, living in the lymphatic
vessels distally to the glands, especially in those of the lower limbs
and scrotum.The embryos after leaving the parent pass into the
lymphatic stream, and thence into the circulating blood.According to
recent observations of Manson, they enter the blood in the evening and
increase in number until midnight, after which they decrease and
disappear by morning, from which time during the day they remain absent
from the circulation.The investigations of the same authority have
shown that when the blood of infected persons is sucked by mosquitoes
these insects also imbibe the embryos, which subsequently undergo
transformation in the mosquitoes into the larval state.In this
condition the filariae may be transferred to water, by drinking which
man may become infected with the parasites.The larvae introduced into
the stomach appear thence to make their way to the lymphatics, within
which they undergo further development to maturity, and thus remain a
long time.The presence of the worms in the lymphatics, with their numerous brood
in the circulating blood, gives rise to haematuria and chyluria.As
results of the obstruction of the lymphatic currents, the parasites
induce inflammation, suppuration, lymphatic abscesses, buboes,
lymphangiectasis, {964} oedema, ascites, chylous hydrocele,
elephantiasis,[3] and certain cutaneous affections.[Footnote 3: Several years since, with the view of ascertaining the
presence of parasitic worms, the writer examined the blood of a case of
elephantiasis under the charge of T. G. Morton, but none were detected.From what we have since been informed of the habits of Filaria
sanguinis, the absence of the parasites may have its explanation in the
circumstance that the blood examined was withdrawn in the daytime.]TREATMENT.--While the treatment of the affection induced by the Filaria
sanguinis is varied and uncertain, the prophylactic measures are
obvious and certain.Under favorable conditions of bright light, high
temperature, and abundant food the stagnant waters of tropical
countries are especially prolific of the minute forms of animals which
harbor parasites.It hence becomes evident that all such waters,
whether obtained from puddles, ponds, tanks, or cisterns, should be
filtered before being used for drinking.Boiling is also effectual in
destroying all the animal life of waters, and thus rendering them
innocuous so far as parasites are concerned.*       *       *       *       *

Several other species of Filaria have been found in the human body, but
are little known and very rare in their occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA LOA.--This species occurs in Western Africa, on the Gaboon
River, and is perhaps more frequent than now commonly supposed.It is
an active worm, little more than an inch in length, and is usually
found beneath the conjunctiva of the eye.It probably also occupies
other positions, and a missionary on the Gaboon informed the writer
that he had extracted one from the back of one of his own fingers.Its
presence produced an intense burning pain.The <DW64>s are reported to
extract the worm by means of a thorn.The worm has also been observed
in Brazil and the West Indies.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA RESTIFORMIS.--Under this name the writer recently described a
large Filaria reported to have been withdrawn from the urethra of a man
in West Virginia.It was obtained by C. L. Garnett, and sent, together

DISEASES OF THE LIVER.BY ROBERTS BARTHOLOW, A.M., M.D., LL.D.I. FUNCTIONAL DISORDERS.DEFINITION.--The term biliousness is used to signify a disturbance of
the gastro-intestinal digestion, with coincident excess in the
production of bile.According to the popular conception, both lay and
medical, the excess of bile is the cause of the symptoms; but when the
whole subject is carefully examined it will be found that biliousness
is made up of several factors, and that the hepatic disorder, if it
exist at all, is a mere incident.PATHOGENY.--From the time of Galen biliousness has been regarded as a
morbid entity and the liver as the organ affected.Stoll, amongst
moderns, first revived the Galenical doctrines.Abernethy[1] was
amongst English physicians the most conspicuous advocate of the
condition called biliousness, and was the apostle of blue pill and
black draught.Copland in his great dictionary[2] more distinctly
formulated the views of the English school--especially that portion of
it influenced by the results of Indian practice--than had been
previously attempted, and hence his work best represents the opinions
and practice of the time amongst the English-speaking peoples.In this
country the great Rush first promulgated the notions of biliousness
which have since so dominated the medical opinion of this continent.A
large part of the United States has proved a fruitful soil for the
cultivation of theories of biliousness, since the condition known under
this name is a frequent accompaniment of malarial poisoning.To this
fact must be attributed the preponderating importance of biliary
derangements in the practice of the physicians of India also.[Footnote 1: _Surgical Works_, London, 1811, vol.[Footnote 2: _A Dictionary of Practical Medicine_, vol.It is a fact which will be hereafter more fully developed that malarial
infection may, and often does, derange the hepatic functions without
producing fever.The malarial poison irritates the liver, and thus more
bile is produced, but the quality deteriorates with the increase in
quantity.The functions of the liver are more disturbed during an
access of intermittent fever: the organ is swollen, the skin is muddy,
the eyes yellow, the tongue coated with a thick yellow fur, and the
urine is deeply tinged with bile-pigment.Many of the metals employed as medicines and as poisons, as gold, {966}
silver, antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, etc., irritate the liver both in
their entrance and in their exit from the organism, and cause
biliousness; and the same fact is true of some vegetable alkaloids and
animal poisons.The liver excretes many of these substances, and in
their passage out from the blood the hepatic cells are irritated and an
increased production of bile is a result.Improper food, indulgence in
fats, sweets, condiments, and all kinds of fermented and alcoholic
liquors, intestinal indigestion arising from any cause, and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, are the most usual and obvious pathogenic
factors.In respect to food and indigestion as etiological factors
there are several points requiring more explicit statement.When
nitrogenous elements (albuminoids) are in excess in quantity or as
respects the power to digest and convert them, immature products, of
which uric acid is the chief, accumulate in the blood.When the fats,
sugars, and starches are in excess of the requirements of the organism
or are imperfectly disposed of in the small intestines, a local
irritation of the mucous membrane is produced, and various complicated,
immature products enter the blood.With these troubles and faults of
intestinal digestion a gastro-duodenal catarrh is usually associated.Without the production of catarrhal jaundice, gastro-duodenal catarrh,
with the forms of indigestion accompanying it, keeps up a reflex
irritation of the liver.Just as the presence of normal chyme induces
the flow of bile, so the unhealthy products of intestinal indigestion
excite an irritation of the liver.The continued operation of this
cause maintains an abnormal activity of the liver, and more bile is
produced than is easily disposed of.SYMPTOMS.--The condition of biliousness, as now understood, is made up
of derangement of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane, with
bile-production in excess and bile-absorption probably delayed.The
symptoms are the product of these complicated conditions.The
complexion is muddy; the conjunctivae are yellow; the tongue is heavily
coated with a yellowish-white fur; a bitter taste persists in the
mouth; the breath is heavy in odor, even fetid; the appetite may be
keen or there may be complete anorexia; a sensation of nausea, of
heaviness, and fulness of the stomach is experienced, especially after
eating; the bowels are confined usually, but occasionally the movements
are relaxed, bilious in appearance, and cause heat and irritation about
the anus; headache is constantly present to some extent, and there is a
sense of fulness with more or less dizziness, and singing in the ears;
vision is rather blurred, and there is a hebetude of mind; the urine is
high-, high in specific gravity, and deposits lithates
abundantly on cooling.When these symptoms are conjoined with
hemicrania, nausea, and vomiting, the case is called bilious sick
headache, and when diarrhoea supervenes, the discharges apparently
containing much bile, it is bilious diarrhoea.The symptoms which above
all others give the character to the morbid complexus are the muddy
(bilious) complexion, the yellow-coated tongue, the yellow
conjunctivae, and the high- urine.The first departure from the
normal may be scarcely observed.Gradually, owing chiefly to errors of
diet, to climatic changes, or to malarial influences, or to these
several factors combined, the affected person drifts into the condition
of biliousness above described.Besides the general malaise, he
experiences no little despondency, inaptitude for exertion, and indeed
actual weakness.Finally, he is unable to apply himself to business,
relinquishes the effort, and seeks advice.{967} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Those who are accustomed to
experience attacks of biliousness suffer from them at certain intervals
which may be tolerably regular--at intervals of a few days, two, three,
or four weeks--when the cause is uniform; but they may happen very
irregularly when the conditions producing them are variable.The
duration of an attack is from two days to a week or more, according to
the severity of the symptoms and to the character of the measures
instituted for relief.The termination is in a return to the normal
state.If the conditions which produced it continue, when one attack is
ended the preparations for another begin at once, and at length
sufficient derangement of the organs concerned arises to constitute the
morbid complexus of biliousness.TREATMENT.--Prophylaxis has great importance, since the causes of the
malady are to a considerable extent, at least, preventable.Errors of
diet in respect to the use of condiments, fats, meat, pastry, etc.When there is pronounced gastro-duodenal catarrh and acid
fermentation in the duodenum, the saccharine, fatty, and starchy
elements of the food must rather be excluded and lean meats allowed.Abundant exercise, bathing, and an open-air life in general should be
directed.Whenever a malarial infection is causative a change of
climate becomes imperative.Heredity cannot, of course, be excluded,
but the tendency to hepatic derangement can be rendered inoperative by
an abstemious life.The remedial management includes the dietetic as well as the medicinal
treatment.When the distress has reached sufficient proportions to
justify such an extreme measure, the patient should be restricted to a
diet exclusively of skimmed milk, of which he is directed to take a
gill or more every three hours.This serves a double purpose, as
aliment and as a depurative agent, for this considerable quantity of
fluid promotes the urinary excretion and the elimination of waste
products.If the case is not severe enough to allow of such an
expedient, the diet should in any event be restricted to skimmed milk
hot, milk and hot water, hot lemonade, a little chicken or mutton
broth, a bit of dry toast, etc.As a rule, although not so palatable,
hot drinks are more beneficial than cold, but if the preference is
decidedly for cold, they may be allowed.After the more severe symptoms
have subsided a little lean meat broiled may be added, and as the cure
proceeds the succulent vegetables and acid fruits may be permitted.Abstinence from potatoes, hominy, cracked wheat, and oatmeal should be
enjoined during the convalescence of those who suffer from habitual
attacks.Medicines may not be necessary to those who have the resolution to
adhere to skimmed milk for several days or who can abstain from food
altogether for a day.Many experienced sufferers, especially through
the South and West and in England, procure rather prompt relief from a
blue pill of ten to fifteen grains or from one to five grains of
calomel at night, followed by a Seidlitz powder, Rochelle or Epsom
salts, or phosphate of soda on the following morning.Such patients
find that no other treatment is as serviceable.They get relief from
other measures, it is true, but neither as promptly nor as
satisfactorily.It is held by the advocates of this practice that the
mercurial acts on the liver--that the surplus bile is carried off; and
they point to the peculiar stools and to {968} the relief experienced
in evidence of the truth of this theory.Without entering on the
argument, which would occupy too much space, it must suffice here to
state that calomel and blue pill do not increase bile-production,[3]
but they do stimulate the intestinal glands and increase excretion from
them.The peculiar greenish stools produced by these mercurials do not
owe their characteristic appearance to the presence of bile, but rather
to the chemical transformations of the mercury itself and to the waste
products excreted by the intestinal glands.Since the researches of
Rutherford have been published, euonymin has been much prescribed in
cases of biliousness.From three to five grains are taken at the
bed-hour, and a mild laxative in the morning.In the same group of
cholagogues are ipecac, iridin, sanguinarin, and especially
podophyllin; but the serious objection to their use is that they
stimulate the liver when this organ is in an irritable state.As
calomel and blue pill have a sedative rather than a stimulant action on
the liver, they are more useful in biliousness than are the true
cholagogues.It should be borne in mind that one-half of a grain of
calomel will have a distinct purgative action on many persons, and that
one grain will rarely need to be exceeded.[Footnote 3: That calomel, the type of a mercurial purgative, does not
increase the discharge of bile has been demonstrated on dogs by Rohrig
and Rutherford, and confirmed by observation of the effects of 20
grains on Westphalen's case of biliary fistula in man--a case in which,
for a time, all the bile escaped externally, and none apparently
entered the intestine (_Deutsch.Med._, 1873, Band xi.In general, notwithstanding the unquestionable utility of the
mercurial, it is better to relieve cases of biliousness by less
objectionable measures.A saline which acts at the same time on the
intestines and kidneys, as Rochelle salts, is usually effective in
bringing relief.A bottle of solution of magnesia citrate, of Saratoga
water (Congress, Hathorn, or High Rock), and of Blue Lick, the famous
sulphurous laxative of Kentucky, may remove the disorder in mild cases
if at the same time a suitable diet is enjoined.Phosphate of soda in
laxative doses, with or without Vichy water, is also a good remedy, if
somewhat slow.The warm purgatives, rhubarb, colocynth, aloes, etc.,
are useful when there is pronounced constipation.DEFINITION.--By the term lithaemia is meant a condition of the system
in which uric (lithic) acid is produced in excess, and in which certain
derangements occur in consequence of the accumulation of this material
in the blood.Uricaemia was the term first suggested by Flint, Sr.,[4]
to express this state, and subsequently lithaemia was employed by
Murchison.[5] The latter has been more generally accepted.In one of
the most recent and valuable contributions to this subject by
DaCosta[6] lithaemia is the term used to designate the complex of
symptoms produced by uric acid in excess.[Footnote 4: _The Principles and Practice of Medicine_, Philada.,
1882.][Footnote 5: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, 2d ed., p.[Footnote 6: _The Medical News_, vol.PATHOGENY.--The ultimate product of albuminoid substances in the
organism prepared for final excretion is urea.That this substance is
{969} finally formed in the liver, to be excreted by the kidneys, seems
now well established.[7] In acute yellow atrophy of the liver, with the
disappearance of the proper structure of the organs urea ceases to be
produced, and instead leucin and tyrosin are excreted.In certain
states of the system characterized by deficient oxidation urea is not
sufficiently formed, and instead uric acid, a lower grade of oxidation
and a product of the disintegration of albuminoid substances, results.An excess of urates is not always pathological.Their excretion seems
to be in a certain sense a safety-valve function.When albuminoid
matters are taken in excess of the power of the system to convert them,
or when the supply of oxygen to the blood is deficient from any cause,
urea is not formed, but uric acid and urates are abundantly excreted by
the urine.[8] Imperfect digestion of the albuminoids when they are not
taken in relatively too large an amount, and limitation below the
normal of the oxidation process when the supply of oxygen is not
insufficient, will have the same effect: in place of urea, uric acid
and urates will be formed and excreted.One of the early results of the
persistent presence of an excess of uric acid is the production of
lithaemia, the morbid complexus of which this excess is at once the
cause and the proof.[Footnote 7: This proposition is not universally accepted.Valmont
(These de Paris, _Etude sur les Causes des Variations de l'Uree dans
quelques Maladies du Foie_, 1879) has carefully studied the excretion
of urea in several diseases in which the proper structure of the liver
is damaged--in atrophic cirrhosis and in cancer.As in these maladies
not all the secreting portion of the organ is destroyed, the argument
is so far weakened.Patients with
cirrhosis or cancer of the liver who eat little excrete but little
urea.If they eat and do not absorb, or vomit or have diarrhoea, the
result is the same.When they partake largely of nitrogenous aliment
the proportion of urea rapidly increases.In a cachectic or simply
anaemic patient the urea falls, apparently in proportion to the state
of the general nutrition and of the work done by the organic functions.Absolute immobility of the patient seems to have an influence on the
amount of urea excreted.In sclerosis or cancer the quantity of urea
falls rapidly on the occurrence of ascites or oedema, when a notable
quantity of urea is found in the fluid.The digitalis often used in
the treatment also contributed to the loss of urea."If these
conclusions are verified, the formation of urea must depend on some
other function.][Footnote 8: Genevoix, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de
l'Acide urique dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876.]The persons who suffer from lithaemia are usually those who indulge in
the pleasures of the table and habitually consume much meat, pastry,
and highly-seasoned and rich food of all kinds.The idle, luxurious,
and indolent, literary men of sedentary habits, men who have led active
lives, but on retiring from business have continued to indulge in a
full diet, are apt to suffer from this malady.Women are less disposed
to it, but if subjected to the same conditions may also be similarly
affected.Especially do those suffer from lithaemia who indulge in malt
liquors or in alcoholic drinks of any kind.These substances act by
deranging digestion, and thus preventing the proper conversion of the
albuminoids, by inducing congestion of the liver, and also by
interfering with the process of oxidation.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of lithaemia include derangements of the
digestive organs and of the liver, of the circulation, and of the
nervous system.As these subjects suffer from gastric and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, they present the usual symptomatology of these
affections, as a sense of weight and oppression at the epigastrium,
acidity, pyrosis, a capricious--sometimes voracious, sometimes
good--appetite, a coated {970} tongue, a bitter taste, etc.The bowels
are irregular, sometimes constipated, occasionally relaxed, with
scybalae.The stools may be liquid, almost black or light-yellow and
grayish.The motions are apt to be offensive, and a good deal of
offensive gas is discharged with them.Hemorrhoids are often present,
and there may be heat and irritation about the anus, and not
unfrequently intolerable itching.After meals there is much depression,
and often an insupportable drowsiness.Irregularity in the rhythm, even
intermissions, of the pulse are not infrequent.The nervous symptoms, as DaCosta has lately insisted on, are the most
important and pronounced.The connection between oxaluria and mental
despondency has long been known, but the nature of the relation remains
undetermined.Headache, frontal and occipital, especially the former,
dizziness, tinnitus aurium, suffusion of the eyes, ecchymoses of the
conjunctiva, are usually present.Not unfrequently the subjects of this
affection experience sudden attacks of vertigo, accompanied by dimness
of vision and intense headache, and are supposed to have some organic
lesion of the brain.They are irritable, despondent, and often
intensely hypochondriacal, almost suicidal--are subject to neuralgic
attacks, and have aching in the limbs, a sense of weariness, and more
or less burning in the palms and soles.The skin is rather dry and the complexion muddy.Urticaria is of
frequent occurrence, and sudden attacks of nausea, vomiting, and
intestinal pain coincide with the appearance of the eruption on the
skin.The urine is usually rather increased in amount, its color heightened,
its acidity above normal, and floating in it, usually visible to the
naked eye, are reddish masses composed of uric acid.More or less pain
in the back, referable to the situation of the kidneys, and sometimes
extending along the course of the ureters, is common.The bladder is
rather irritable, and the passage of the urine produces heat and
scalding.The testicles are apt to feel sore and are somewhat
retracted.On standing, the urine may deposit uric acid and the urates
copiously, or the acid may be seen to form a cloud which slowly
subsides.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course and duration of
lithaemia are much influenced by the habits of life of the person
affected.When unopposed by treatment and no change is made in the
conditions producing it, a gradual increase in the various disturbances
takes place.After a time structural changes occur in the liver; the
organs of circulation early undergo atheromatous degeneration; various
cerebral disorders due to degenerative changes arise; and acute
intercurrent affections may terminate life.Amongst the secondary
maladies due to lithaemia are gout, diabetes, renal calculi, and
nephritic colic.If the cases are subjected to appropriate treatment,
curative results may be certainly obtained.The prognosis, then, will
be influenced materially by the moral strength of the patient.If he is
one who can surrender his appetites and live abstemiously, a cure may
be promised.The case is far different with those who will continue the
use of malt, vinous, or alcoholic drinks, and will persist in indulging
in the pleasures of the table.DIAGNOSIS.--The differentiation of lithaemia from other affections
offers no special difficulties.From gastro-duodenal catarrh it is
separated by the {971} excess of uric acid in the urine only, the other
symptoms being for the most part the same.The cerebral symptoms--the
vertigo, headache, etc.--are to be distinguished from the same due to
actual disease of the brain by the previous history, by the absence of
changes seen on ophthalmoscopic examination and of other signs of brain
disease, and by the subsequent behavior.Cases of cerebral mischief
producing such effects would rapidly develop into serious states,
whereas in lithaemia there are great fluctuations, but no apparent
progress in many months.In lithaemia also there are no changes in the
fundus oculi, whereas in brain diseases choked disk, hemorrhage into
the retina, white atrophy, etc.Further, in
lithaemia there are no disorders of sensibility, of motility, or of
intellection, whilst these are ordinary evidences of cerebral mischief.TREATMENT.--Attention to diet is of the first importance.As uric acid
is an intermediate product in the metamorphosis of albumen, it might be
supposed that to diminish the quantity of this constituent of the food
would be sufficient.In some cases this suffices, but usually attention
must be given to the peculiarities of digestion characteristic of each
patient.More frequently trouble arises from indulgence in the starchy
and saccharine constituents of the diet; in some a very considerable
gastro-duodenal catarrh exists, and the mucus, acting as a ferment,
sets up an acetic fermentation in the starchy and saccharine
substances, with the necessary production of much carbonic acid gas.If
the fats disagree, the butyric fermentation also takes place, and very
irritating fat acids result.In these cases there is usually much gas
formed in the stomach and intestine, and an immediate ratio appears to
exist between the degree of mental despondency and the quantity of gas
in the intestinal canal.It follows, then, that in cases of lithaemia
the saccharine, starchy, and fatty constituents of an ordinary diet
should be omitted from the food of such subjects.Bread should be
partaken of very sparingly, and the foods containing starch, sugar, and
oil ought not to be partaken of at all.The succulent vegetables, as
lettuce, spinach, celery, cole-slaw, tomatoes, etc., ought to be
substituted.Lean fresh meats, poultry, game (plainly cooked), fresh
fish, oysters, eggs, etc.On
the other hand, there may be those who do better on a diet of
vegetables and fruit, excluding meat.In such we may suppose the fault
lies in the stomach digestion, where the albuminoids are converted into
peptones, the intestinal digestion being active and normal.All kinds
of wine and malt liquors should be prohibited.Coffee and tea must also
be relinquished.Without the carefully-regulated diet medicines can
accomplish but little; hence he who would obtain curative results must
give careful attention to every dietetic detail.As deficient oxidation is an important factor in developing lithaemia,
active exercise must be enjoined.The amount of exercise must be
determined by the condition of the individual and the time, regulated
as far as may be by the period after meals.As when the food prepared
for assimilation is entering the circulation oxygen is needed to
perfect the final changes, it seems clear that exercise should be taken
three or four hours after the process of digestion has begun.Walking
exercise is better than any other for this purpose, but it should not
be carried to the point of exhaustion from fatigue.Sea-air and
sea-bathing are oxidizing agents of considerable value, and are
especially useful to the {972} subjects of lithaemia suffering at the
same time from malarial infection.Medicines are administered with the view to accomplish two purposes: to
correct the disorders of digestion, to promote oxidation.One of the
most useful remedies is nitric acid, five to ten minims of the official
diluted acid being given before meals.It is more especially effective
when there is an excessive production of acid.The fermentation which
produces acid and the diffusion of acid-forming materials from the
blood are alike prevented by it.The injunction to administer it before
meals must be borne in mind when these purposes are to be subserved.Nitric acid, as well as the other mineral acids, but in a greater
degree, promotes the flow of bile.This well-known clinical fact has
been confirmed by experiments.Under the use of nitric acid, as above
advised, uric acid and the urates disappear from the urine, being
excreted as urea, and hence this remedy accomplishes both of the
objects for which medicines are administered in this disorder.No other
mineral acid can fill its place in this connection.Alkalies possess very decidedly the power to promote oxidation.The
soda salts are objectionable, for, combining with uric acid, they form
the insoluble urate of soda.The salts of potash and lithium, on the
other hand, form soluble combinations, and they also increase
elimination.Much depends on the time at which they are administered,
as Bence Jones,[9] and since Ralfe[10] especially, has shown.To
increase the alkalinity of the blood and urine, they must be taken
after meals, for then the acid materials of digestion are pouring into
the blood.For the same reason, if alkalies are administered to
neutralize the acidity of the intestinal canal, they must be given
after meals.The most useful alkaline remedies are liquor potassae,
bicarbonate of potash, Rochelle salts, citrate of lithium, etc.The
effervescing preparations of potash and of lithium are elegant and
palatable forms in which to administer these remedies.They may also be
taken dissolved in Vichy water, in our Saratoga Vichy, or in Carlsbad
or Bethesda.When the use of mineral waters is not contraindicated in
the state of the digestive organs, great good is accomplished by the
persistent use of Vichy, foreign or domestic, of Carlsbad, and the
alkaline waters of Wisconsin.[Footnote 9: _Lectures on Pathology and Therapeutics_, by H. Bence
Jones, London, pp.[Footnote 10: _Physiological Chemistry_, by Charles Henry Ralfe,
London, 1883.]The so-called cholagogues are unquestionably useful, but they become
less and less necessary according to the success achieved in the
dietetic course.Phosphate of soda is one of the most effective of this
group of medicines.As it acts as a compound, and not as a salt of soda
merely, it does not come within the prohibition against the use of soda
salts.It promotes the flow of bile and appears to remove the catarrhal
state of the mucous membrane.A teaspoonful three times a day is the
quantity usually required.Under some circumstances it may be
advantageously combined with arseniate of soda.Mercurials were
formerly almost universally used, but they have been largely supplanted
by podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, etc., and by the phosphate of soda
above mentioned.Podophyllin is indicated when constipation is a
symptom.An efficient mode of giving it is in the form of granules, but
it must be continued without intermission for some time or during the
existence of {973} the lithaemia.The quantity given should be
sufficient to maintain the evacuations in a soluble state.Good results
are obtained from a combination of podophyllin with extracts of
physostigma, nux vomica, and belladonna.When distinct torpor of the
liver without constipation exists, euonymin, combined with physostigma,
may be advantageously used.For the vertigo and hypochondriasis no
remedy is more beneficial than arsenic (Fowler's solution) in small
doses kept up for some time, and it is also distinctly curative of the
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane.When malarial infection is the
cause of lithaemia, quinine becomes indispensable.Topical agents in some cases render important aid to the other curative
measures.A daily sponge-bath, the water made more stimulating by the
addition of sea-salt, is very useful in the absence of sea-bathing.Friction of the hepatic region with the official ointment of the red
iodide of mercury unquestionably stimulates the hepatic functions.General faradization and faradic and galvanic excitation of the
chylopoietic system promotes activity of the digestive apparatus and of
the organic functions in general.Hepatic Glycosuria (Temporary).DEFINITION.--By the term hepatic glycosuria in this connection is meant
a temporary glycosuria due to excessive formation of glycogen.The
liver, unduly stimulated, produces more glycogen than can be disposed
of, and hence it is excreted by the kidneys as grape-sugar.PATHOGENY.--In the normal condition it is supposed that the glycogen
produced by the liver is converted into grape-sugar, and soon oxidized
and thus consumed.One theory of diabetes maintained that in some way
the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar was excessive and beyond
the oxidizing power of the blood, and hence this substance was
discharged in the urine.The recent discovery by Pavy[11] of glycogen
in considerable amount in the blood of all parts of the body renders it
certain that there are peculiar conditions necessary to the formation
of grape-sugar in sufficient quantity to constitute diabetes.It is
tolerably certain that an excess of acid in the intestinal canal,
diminishing thus the alkalinity of the blood, will have as a symptom
sugar in the urine.Persons disposed to the accumulation of fat, and
eating freely of sugar and starchy food, are apt to have intestinal
indigestion, and the acid produced by the fermentation of these
substances will, after its absorption, hinder the conversion of any
food-sugar.In such subjects also there may be an increased conversion
of the glycogen of the blood into sugar under the same conditions.Such
a glycosuria must necessarily be temporary and a purely functional
disorder.[Footnote 11: _The Lancet_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--The subjects of the malady under consideration are of full
habit, even obese.They habitually consume considerable quantities of
malt liquors and a diet composed largely of the starchy and saccharine
foods.If not in malt liquors, they at least indulge freely in bread,
potatoes, pastry, cakes--in all forms of farinaceous food, fats, and
sweets.They have a keen appetite, eat largely, and drink freely of
fluids.As {974} a rule, these subjects are but little disposed to
physical exercise and lead rather sedentary lives.Indulgence in such a
mode of life tends to increase the accumulation of fat, weakens the
muscles, and with them the heart-muscle, and slowly induces a
gastro-intestinal catarrh accompanied by stomachal and intestinal
indigestion.At first, heaviness, oppression, and drowsiness after
meals are experienced; then acidity, pyrosis, and eructations follow;
and ultimately the evidences of intestinal indigestion--flatulence,
pain, irregular and unhealthy evacuations, etc.--come on.Meanwhile,
the appetite is not usually impaired, and the disposition to drink
fluids increases; the amount of urine voided is greater, and to rise
during the night for the purpose of emptying the bladder comes to be a
fixed habit.The urine under these circumstances is copious,
high-, acid, and deposits on cooling abundantly of uric acid and
urates.The amount passed in twenty-four hours will reach sixty,
eighty, or more ounces, and the specific gravity will range from 1025
to 1035.On testing in the usual way, traces of sugar, more or less
distinct, will appear,[12] but not constantly, and hence repeated
examinations are necessary to determine the quantity.As a rule, the
evidence of the presence of sugar in small amount is satisfactory.[Footnote 12: In testing for sugar, when the urine contains the urates
in such abundance there is danger of error.In using Trommer's,
Fehling's, or Moore's test, on heating, the urates will effect a
reduction of the copper or bismuth.It is necessary, therefore, to
separate them before applying the test.This is accomplished as
follows: The urine is evaporated to dryness on a water-bath; the sugar
in the evaporated residue is dissolved out by absolute alcohol, and
then an aqueous solution is prepared, to which the test is applied.An
experienced operator will not need to take such precautions, for,
familiar with the reactions, he can readily judge of the results.]Various affections of the skin appear in the subjects of this malady,
and urticaria, prurigo, eczema, and boils are the forms most usual.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Slow in developing, this temporary
glycosuria is also slow in its course.It remains nearly stationary for
months, even years.Meanwhile the degenerative changes associated with
it slowly develop on all sides.The quantity of sugar does not greatly
increase, for its amount, being apparently dependent on the quantity of
acid entering the blood from the intestinal canal, must continue nearly
at the same standard.It is comparatively rare for true diabetes to
develop out of this state, although such a termination must be regarded
as a natural outcome.One reason, it may be, why such a conclusion is
not often reached is because of intercurrent maladies.It is an
important fact that acute serous--less often
parenchymatous--inflammations are very apt to occur during the
existence of even temporary glycosuria.Under appropriate management
this disorder is readily amenable to treatment.Hence the prognosis
will be favorable or not according to the skill exhibited in its
treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--This malady offers no special difficulty in diagnosis.From
gastro-duodenal catarrh and from lithaemia it is distinguished by the
saccharine condition of the urine.From diabetes it is separated by the
rate of progress, by the protracted duration of the case without any
distinct advance, and by the temporary and fugitive character of the
glycosuria.TREATMENT.--To carefully regulate the diet is the first consideration.The traces of sugar and the excess of urates rapidly disappear when the
{975} starches, sugar, and fats are withdrawn from the diet.Indeed,
the rule as to alimentation must be as rigidly enforced as in true
diabetes, but after the gastro-intestinal catarrh has subsided the
ordinary mixed diet--that before the disturbance began--may be returned
to gradually.Active exercise must be enjoined under the same
conditions and for the same purpose as in the treatment of lithaemia.In these obese subjects, unaccustomed to movement, exercise must be
cautiously undertaken; beginning with short excursions, it must be
gradually increased.Horseback riding is an excellent expedient, but
should not take the place of walking.The merely medical measures have a twofold direction: to remove the
gastro-duodenal catarrh; to promote oxidation of the sugar in the blood
or prevent the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar.Vichy water,
the potash salts, and alkalies generally serve to accomplish the
latter, and phosphate and arseniate of soda, tinctures of nux vomica,
and of physostigma, bismuth, and carbolic acid, relieve the former.Small doses of Fowler's solution (two drops ter in die), and a minim
three times a day of a mixture in equal parts of tincture of iodine and
carbolic acid, are effective remedies in gastro-duodenal catarrh.DEFINITION.--The term jaundice has its origin in the French word jaune,
yellow.Icterus, which has come to be a more technical word, is of
uncertain Greek origin, and is much employed by French writers as
ictere.The common German name is Gelbsucht, a highly expressive
designation.Jaundice signifies a yellow discoloration of the skin
caused by the presence of bile.As a symptom it will receive much consideration in the pages to follow,
but there is also a functional disorder--a jaundice due to a
disturbance in the biliary functions, without evidences of structural
change--which must be discussed here.This preliminary statement of our
present knowledge of jaundice will facilitate the comprehension of it
as a symptom, and will render unnecessary explanations that will be
merely a repetition of previous ones.CAUSES.--The theories of the causation of jaundice may be reduced to
three: 1, that it is due to a disorganization of the blood in which the
coloring matter is set free, and hence is known as haematogenous; 2,
that the materials of the bile, which it is the office of the liver to
remove from the blood, are not so disposed of; 3, that the bile, after
being formed by the liver, is absorbed into the blood because of an
obstacle to its escape, and hence this is called hepatogenous jaundice.The modern view of haematogenous jaundice had its origin in the
supposed discovery of the identity of haematoidin with bilirubin.If
the pigment of the blood has the same composition as the pigment of the
bile, haematogenous jaundice will be produced whenever haematoidin is
set free in the blood.Virchow[13] was the first investigator to show
the close resemblance between these two pigments.Since his observation
was made an identity of haematoidin and bilirubin has been maintained
by Zenker, Valentiner, Kuhne, and others, and as strenuously denied by
{976} Stadeler, Preyer, Young, and others.At the present time it
appears to be established that although the blood- and bile-pigments
are closely related, they are not identical.[14] Nevertheless, a
haematogenous jaundice is still admitted to exist by Leyden,[15]
Immermann,[16] Gubler,[17] Ponfick,[18] and some others.The existence
or non-existence of this form of jaundice is, however, of little
importance in this connection, since, if it ever occur, the malady of
which it is a symptom is not an affection of the liver, but of the
blood, as phosphorus-poisoning, pyaemia, etc.[Footnote 13: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band i. p.[Footnote 14: Legg, J. Wickham, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, p.[Footnote 15: _Beitrage zur Pathologie des Icterus_, Berlin, 1866, p.[Footnote 17: _Union medicale_, 1857, p.[Footnote 18: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The second theory, that the bile is preformed in the blood and
separated by the liver, and that jaundice results because of the
failure of the liver to perform this office, is no longer entertained,
although largely held down to within a very recent period.As the bile
acids and bile-pigments are not to be found in the blood, chemistry
lends no support to the theory of jaundice by suppression of the
hepatic function.As they do not exist in the blood and are found in
the secretion of the liver, there can be no other view held than that
they are formed by this organ.[19]

[Footnote 19: The old doctrine of jaundice by suppression, which has
always been maintained by Harley (_On Jaundice_, London, 1863, p.20
_et seq._), has been again restated and strongly advocated by him in
his treatise on _The Diseases of the Liver_, p.83, which was issued in
1883.In the two following postulates he formulates his view:

"1.The biliary secretion can be actually retarded, and even totally
arrested, without alteration of hepatic tissue.When the liver strikes work and secretes no bile, the animal body
becomes jaundiced as a direct consequence thereof."This view, he affirms, "can be made comparatively easy of absolute
proof."The evidence on which he chiefly relies is exceedingly fallacious.It
rests on two facts: the existence of a case of jaundice in which the
ducts and gall-bladder contain no bile, but only ordinary mucus; the
appearances presented by a liver in a case of jaundice due to
obstruction of the common duct.The evidence afforded by the former is
entirely fallacious, because in an old case of jaundice with catarrh of
the bile-ducts such changes take place in the bile that it loses all of
its distinctive characteristics.This may be seen in an ancient example
of obstruction of the cystic duct, where the bile which the
gall-bladder contained is ultimately transformed into a whitish or
colorless mucus.The changes which occur in the so-called cysts of the
arachnoid are comparable, and exhibit the entire transformation of
blood-pigment, which is closely allied to bile-pigment.]The third theory of jaundice--that which refers the disease to an
absorption of the bile into the blood after it has been formed by the
liver--is the one now most generally held, and, indeed, as one of the
causes is universally held.The bile is absorbed into the blood because
an obstacle to its passage by the bile-ducts exists at some point in
their course.This is the principal, but not the only, cause of
absorption.When the pressure in the vessels falls below that in the
ducts, bile will pass toward and into the vessels.Again, it sometimes
happens that a considerable part of the bile discharged into the
intestines is reabsorbed unchanged, and enters the portal vein and the
general circulation, thus causing jaundice.The disturbances of the liver causing jaundice are various.It
sometimes occurs without cause, and the first intimation of it is the
peculiar tint of the skin.It is certainly true that powerful emotions
are causative; thus, a violent anger has brought on an attack.In such
a case we must suppose a depression of the vaso-motor system, and such
a lowering of the blood-pressure as to favor the passage of bile into
the {977} veins rather than into the bile-ducts.Thus, it has been
abundantly shown that a slight difference in pressure will divert the
bile in either direction.Heidenhain[20] has demonstrated that the bile
passes in the direction of least resistance, and in the case of the
considerable vaso-motor depression caused by extreme emotion the least
resistance is in the direction of the vessels.More frequently than
moral emotion is catarrh of the bile-ducts.It is not necessary for the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane to close the ducts to have
the bile pass into the veins; such a degree of swelling as to make the
passage of the bile somewhat difficult suffices.A simple hyperaemia of
the mucous membrane may cause sufficient obstruction of the bile-ducts
to give rise to jaundice.Gastro-intestinal catarrh plays an important
part in the production of simple jaundice.Frerichs[21] ascertained
that of 41 cases, gastro-duodenal catarrh existed in 34.Ponfick[22]
considers catarrh of the ducts the principal factor.In fact, at the
present time there is but one dissenting voice on this point.[23]

[Footnote 20: Quoted by Legg, _supra_, p.[Footnote 21: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 22: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 23: Harley, _Diseases of the Liver_, 1883, p.440 _et seq._]

Gastro-duodenal catarrh extends by contiguity of tissue to the mucous
lining of the bile-ducts.The catarrhal state of the mucous membrane is
produced by errors of diet, acid indigestion, indulgence in condiments,
wines, and rich foods in general.Climatic changes, malarial infection,
exposure to cold and dampness, etc.are indirectly causative of
jaundice through the intermediation of gastro-duodenal catarrh.Formerly, obstruction of the gall-ducts was supposed to be caused
sometimes by a spasmodic contraction of the organic muscular fibre
assumed to exist in the walls of the ducts.Although the presence of
these muscular elements has been denied, Heidenhain has lately,
apparently, demonstrated them.Audige has made observations
confirmatory of those of Heidenhain, and Dujardin-Beaumetz[24] has
verified the statements of Audige.It seems, therefore, in a high
degree probable that organic muscular elements exist in the walls of
the hepatic ducts, and that spasmodic icterus may therefore occur.SYMPTOMS.--Simple icterus may exist without any other obvious symptoms
than the yellow discoloration of the skin.In most cases, however, the
yellowness is preceded for a week or more by the symptoms of a
gastro-intestinal catarrh, or these symptoms accompany the jaundice.There is much mental depression and a general malaise is experienced.Headache, mental hebetude, a total loss of appetite, a furred tongue,
and a bitter taste, nausea and sometimes vomiting, constipation or
diarrhoea, precede or accompany the jaundice.When these symptoms
precede for some time the appearance of yellowness, it is probable that
the biliary derangement is secondary to the gastro-duodenal catarrh,
but when they occur with the jaundice it is probable that they are due
to the absence of bile from the intestine.The yellowness first appears in the conjunctiva for a day or two before
the skin is tinted, and within forty-eight hours after the flow of bile
into the intestine has ceased.The face next becomes yellow, then the
body, {978} and afterward the limbs, but in some cases the limbs remain
free from discoloration.The lips do not exhibit any change of color,
but the roof of the mouth, the palate, and the mucous membrane under
the tongue are yellow.The saliva does not, as a rule, contain
bile-pigment or exhibit any changes of color unless mercurial
salivation is caused, when it becomes greenish in color and has a
bitter taste.[25] A yellow tint of the sweat, especially under the
arm-pits, is common.The milk very often contains bile-pigment or is
changed in color in some way.[Footnote 25: Legg, _On the Bile, etc._, _supra_.]The feces are colorless or have a grayish or clay- tint, and are
semi-solid, although sometimes hard and dry.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is very often present.There may be considerable flatulence,
and more or less pain in consequence about the umbilicus, and the gas
when discharged is very offensive.The stools also, in some cases, have
an odor of decomposition, and if carefully examined particles of food,
undigested and decomposing, will be found.The feces may have a
parti-<DW52> appearance--part whitish or grayish or clay-, and
part of a normal color.The obstruction to the flow of bile may be in a part, and indeed in a
small part comparatively, of the liver, and hence there may be
sufficient bile flow down to color the feces to a greater or less
extent.But a small amount of bile-pigment in the blood suffices to
tint the whole surface of the body.The urine may exhibit changes in appearance before the conjunctiva
becomes yellow.It is  in all possible degrees, from a merely
high normal hue to a deep brownish almost black tint.It may be deep
red and clear like dark brandy or brown like porter, and thick with
urates.Usually, the urine of jaundice deposits abundantly of urates,
but this fact is more especially true of those patients retaining
appetite or having a voracious appetite and indulging in a full diet
without restraint.The reaction of the urine is acid, and the specific
gravity does not often descend below 1010, and may be 1030.The amount
passed in twenty-four hours varies, but does not differ materially from
the normal.Toward the termination of some fatal cases the quantity of
urine has greatly diminished, and in a few instances was suppressed,
but in such examples other factors than hepatic disease were concerned.More or less albumen is nearly constantly present in the urine of
jaundice, but the detection of a trace is very difficult when the
urine, as is so often the case, is cloudy.The urine should be
carefully filtered before applying the test, and a specimen for
comparison should be placed alongside of that being examined.If on
boiling no haze appears, it may be developed by dropping in some nitric
acid.The nitric-acid test, so often employed by allowing some drops of
urine to trickle down the test-tube and observing the reaction at the
point of contact, is, in the writer's experience, very fallacious.The
source of the albumen in jaundiced urine is obviously the
blood-globules.As Von Dusch first demonstrated, and Kuhne[26]
afterward clearly confirmed, the bile acids dissolve the red
corpuscles.As the quantity of albumen in the urine is small, it is
reasonable to conclude, as suggested by Legg, that the bile acids are
not present in the blood in any considerable amount.[Footnote 26: _Archiv fur path.When any large quantity of bile is contained in the urine, its
detection is not difficult.A strip of muslin dipped in the urine will
be stained, and the underclothing of the patient will have the
yellowish spots {979} caused by bile.Gmelin's test is the most
convenient.This is applied as follows: Some nitric acid containing
nitrous--which is the case of the ordinary commercial article--is put
into a test-tube, and some of the suspected urine is allowed to trickle
down the side of the tube to come in contact, but not mix, with the
acid.At the point of contact, when the urine contains bile-pigment,
first a zone of green, then blue, violet, and finally red color,
develops.As this play of colors takes place on the instant, the
attention must be sharply fixed to see the changes.Rosenbach[27]
suggests this test be applied by filtering some urine containing bile
through filtering-paper and touching the paper with a drop of nitric
acid.The result is, a green circle forms at the point of contact.The
usual mode of applying Gmelin's test is to place on the bottom of a
common white plate or on a porcelain dish a thin film of the urine, and
carefully bring in contact with it a thin film of nitric acid.The
color reaction mentioned above takes place at the margin of contact.[Footnote 27: _Centralblatt fur die medicin Wissenschaft_, 1876, p.Besides the presence of bile and albumen, and some fatty epithelium
from the tubules, there is no material change in the composition of the
urine.At one time it was supposed that the amount of urea was greatly
lessened, but later and more accurate investigations have shown that
this excretion is in greater or less quantity according to the food
taken, and bears no relation to the jaundice.On the other hand,
Genevoix[28] maintains that the quantity of urea is increased in
spasmodic icterus, and in the same ratio the uric acid declines.As
regards the chlorides and other salts, there seems to be a tolerably
constant ratio in their variations with the changes of quantity of urea
and uric acid--are therefore nearly related to the amount of food
taken.[Footnote 28: _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de l'Acide urique
dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876, p.59 _et seq._]

As regards the condition of the liver, there is no apparent change.In
topography, in the area of hepatic dulness, and in the dimensions of
the right hypochondrium the local condition does not deviate from the
normal in simple jaundice.There may be more or less tenderness over
the epigastrium and along the inferior margin of the liver, but there
is rarely any actual pain.The circulation of bile in the blood and the action of the bile acids
on the red corpuscles must have an influence on the functions of
various organs.In some cases of jaundice, but by no means in all, the
pulse is slow, in a few instances descending as low as 40 per minute,
and, according to Frerichs,[29] as low as 21 per minute.Usually, the
pulse-rate is not lower than 60.To observe the slowing of the heart
the patient must be recumbent, for the pulse rises to the normal or
above on assuming the erect posture and moving about.The occurrence of
fever also prevents the depression of the circulation.The slowing of
the heart is found to be due to the action of the bile acids on the
cardiac ganglia.The other elements of the bile were ascertained to
have no influence on the circulation.As the heart may be slowed by an
increase of inhibition through stimulation of the vagi or by a
paralyzing action on the cardiac muscle, it was necessary to eliminate
these effects to establish the influence of the bile acids on the
ganglia.By exclusion, and by ascertaining the effects {980} of the
bile acids on a properly prepared Stannius heart, Steiner and Legg have
succeeded in demonstrating this important point.[30]

[Footnote 29: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 30: _Archiv f. Anat.u. Physiol._, 1874, p.474; Legg, _On
the Bile, etc._, _loc.cit._]

The temperature of jaundice is normal usually, sometimes below.When a
febrile affection occurs during the course of jaundice, the rise of
temperature belonging to it is prevented in considerable part,
sometimes entirely.The depression of temperature is referred by Legg
to the lessened activity of the hepatic functions; but it seems to the
writer more satisfactory to refer it to the action of the bile acids on
the red corpuscles, the conveyors of oxygen.Rohrig[31] has shown
experimentally that the injection of bile acids has this effect on the
temperature of animals.[Footnote 31: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1863, p.The nutrition of the body early suffers in jaundice; more or less loss
of flesh soon occurs, and debility and languor are experienced.There
are several factors concerned in this result.The diversion of the bile
from the intestine interferes in the digestion of certain materials;
when jaundice occurs, glycogen ceases to be formed--and this substance
has an important office in nutrition and force-evolution--and the
injury done to the red blood-globules interferes with oxidation
processes.The functions of the nervous system are variously disturbed in
jaundice.Headache, frontal, occipital, or general, is present in most
cases to a greater or less extent.Hebetude of mind and despondency are
nearly if not quite invariable, although it is not unusual to see men
with jaundice engaged in their ordinary avocations.More or less wakefulness at night, or sleep with
disturbing dreams, not unfrequently coincide with drowsiness during the
waking moments.In severe cases of icterus dependent on structural
changes the cholaemia may produce stupor, delirium, convulsions, etc.,
but such formidable symptoms do not belong to the simple and merely
functional jaundice.Vision is sometimes  yellow, or, rather, white objects appear
yellow, but this must be a rare symptom, since Frerichs never met with
an example.Murchison[32] narrates a case, and the writer has seen one.It is a fugitive symptom, rarely continuing longer than two or three
days.The term xanthopsy has been applied to it.[Footnote 32: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, New York,
1877, p.A nervous symptom of common occurrence is pruritus of the skin.This
may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and in any case is a disagreeable
and persistent affection, always worse at night.It may appear before
the jaundice so long a period as ten days, as in a case mentioned by
Graves,[33] and two months in a case narrated by Flint.[34] It is most
severe at the beginning of the jaundice, and usually disappears before
the jaundice ceases, but it may continue to the end.It is not limited
to any particular part of the body.Pruritus is sometimes accompanied
by urticaria, and the irritation caused by the friction of the skin may
set up an eczema.Occasionally boils, and more rarely carbuncles,
appear during the course of jaundice.Another curious affection of the
skin which occurs during chronic jaundice is xanthelasma or
vitiligoidea.First mentioned by Rayer, this disease was afterward well
described by Addison and Gull[35] under the name vitiligoidea, and they
recognized two varieties, v. plana and v. tuberosa.The plane variety
is found on the {981} mucous membrane of the mouth, the eyelids, the
palms of the hands, and the flexures of the joints, and consists of a
yellowish-white soft eruption slightly raised above the surrounding
skin and varying in size from a pin's point to a dime in size.The
color is described as like that of a dead leaf or chamois-skin.The
tuberose variety consists of small tubercles from a millet-seed to a
pea in size.They have a yellowish color, are tense and shining, and
are placed on the ears, neck, knuckles, elbows, knees, and other parts.Whilst the plane variety gives little if any uneasiness, the tuberose
is apt to become irritated and painful.From the pathological point of
view this eruption consists of proliferating connective-tissue
corpuscles, some of which have undergone fatty degeneration.[36] The
morbid process tends to occur symmetrically, as on the eyelids, to
which it may be confined, but it usually develops in patches, and may
indeed extend over the whole body, when it is called xanthelasma
multiplex.[Footnote 33: _Clinical Lectures on the Practice of Medicine_, 2d ed.,
by Neligan, p.[Footnote 35: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1851, p.[Footnote 36: Waldeyer, _Archiv fur path.The disorganization of the blood caused by jaundice sets up a
hemorrhagic diathesis.This result, however, is not usual in simple
jaundice, but belongs rather to acute yellow atrophy, sclerosis, and
other chronic affections of the liver.It will therefore be more
appropriately considered in connection with those maladies.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--When jaundice is a symptom merely,
it pursues a course determined by the peculiarities of the disease.The
duration of simple jaundice varies from one to four weeks, the average
being about three weeks.If it continues longer than two months,
suspicions may well be entertained that the case is of a more
formidable character than simple jaundice.The termination of this form
of the disease is always in health.A favorable prognosis can be given
only in the case of an accurate diagnosis.Those cases may terminate
more speedily which, being of malarial origin, are treated by efficient
doses of quinine.If delirium and coma come on, the apparently mild
case means, probably, acute yellow atrophy, which cannot at the onset
be distinguished from simple jaundice.If any nervous symptoms occur or
if hemorrhage appears, the case will prove to be serious.A rise of
temperature usually indicates mischief.When the stools begin to
exhibit the normal appearance from the presence of bile, a satisfactory
termination of the case may be soon expected.The yellowness of the
skin disappears slowly after the natural route of the bile has been
restored, and the urine is the last to lose the pigment, as it was the
first to exhibit its presence.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of jaundice as a symptom is usually easy.It
should be remembered that jaundice cannot be detected at night by any
ordinary light, and when it is disappearing the tint varies, now being
distinct, again absent.Mental emotion when the color is fading
develops it.Browning by the sun's rays causes an appearance which
might be mistaken by a superficial observer for jaundice, but it is
only necessary to look at the parts protected and at the urine to
discover the true state of the case.The detection of bile in the urine
and the ocular evidence of its absence from the stools will be
conclusive.In some cases of jaundice the stools are golden yellow, and
in many instances they are offensive.{982} It is important to mark out the limits of the gall-bladder, if it
is of sufficient size to do so, for any accumulation of bile in this
sac signifies an obstruction of the ductus communis choledochus.If the
jaundice has come on after the symptoms of gastro-duodenal catarrh, is
recent, continues but two or three weeks, and then subsides without any
nervous symptoms or hemorrhage, it is a case of simple jaundice,
probably due to catarrh or spasm of the bile-ducts.If the jaundice be
preceded by attacks of severe pain, nausea, and vomiting, and
disappears after a week or two, the case is one of hepatic calculi.If
the jaundice persists months after such an attack of acute pain, and
does not disappear after a year or more, it is probably due to an
impacted calculus.The other diagnostic relations of jaundice are more
properly considered in connection with the malady of which jaundice is
a symptom.TREATMENT.--For jaundice the symptom the treatment is included in that
of the disease.Here the treatment of simple jaundice, the functional
disorder, is to be discussed.If there is much nausea, the tongue is
heavily coated, and, especially if the seizure has followed dietetic
excesses, an emetic of ipecac may be highly serviceable.Recent
experiments have proved the accuracy of the clinical observations which
recognized the cholagogue property of ipecac, and hence the emetic
effect of this remedy is aided by its power to promote the discharge of
bile.Emetics are of course contraindicated when jaundice is due to an
impacted calculus, to malignant disease, to echinococci or other kinds
of tumor.If there is much irritability of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, as shown in vomiting and diarrhoea, small doses of calomel
(1/12 to 1/4 grain) three or four times a day are highly useful.If
calomel possessed the property ascribed to it of stimulating the liver,
it would be injurious; it is beneficial here because it has a sedative
effect at first, followed, when a sufficient amount has accumulated, by
an eliminant action.Such hepatic stimulants as euonymin, sanguinarin,
podophyllin, jalap, colocynth, rhubarb, etc.have long been used in
cases of jaundice with the view that the liver is torpid and needs
stimulating.It may be inquired, however, If the bile already formed
has no outlet by the proper route, what utility can there be in making
the organ produce more?The true reason for the administration of such
remedies in any case of obstructive jaundice is to cause such downward
pressure as to force out of the duct an obstructing plug of mucus.The
writer has known this result to be accomplished by a dose of compound
jalap powder when a great variety of remedies had been employed in
vain.One of the most efficient remedies--in the writer's considerable
experience the most efficient--is phosphate of sodium, of which a
drachm or more is administered three times a day.This remedy liquefies
mucous plugs and promotes the flow of bile without harshly and rudely
forcing the biliary secretion, and it also has a marked curative effect
in gastro-duodenal catarrh.It may be given advantageously with
arseniate of soda--the latter in dose of 1/20 grain--and dissolved in a
tumblerful of Vichy water or Saratoga Vichy water, or preferably in a
wineglassful of hot water.Free use of alkaline and laxative mineral
waters is desirable, for a double purpose--to act on the liver and on
intestinal digestion, and to promote the excretion of biliary matters
by the kidneys.In this country we have a number to select from--the
Saratoga, Bethesda, Michigan, and others.Certain sulphurous waters,
{983} as the Blue Lick of Kentucky, are highly useful in the more
chronic cases.Sulphur baths may be conjoined to the internal
administration of the waters.Nitric and nitro-muriatic acids have long been celebrated for their
good effects in jaundice.It is the presence of the acid chyme in the
duodenum which excites the normal flow of bile, and Bernard found that
applying acid to the orifice of the common duct in the intestine has
the same effect.There is then a rational reason for the administration
of this remedy.A nitro-muriatic bath, both local and general, was
formerly more used than now.Its utility is questionable, and the
difficulties in the way of applying it great.Recently, Gerhardt[37] has proposed to faradize the gall-bladder, and
by compression with the fingers to empty it, forcing the bile into the
intestine, and thus clearing out obstructions.This seems to be very
questionable if not dangerous practice, but repeated successes will
justify it.[Footnote 37: _Sammlung klinische Vortrage_, Volkmann, p.Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Fats, starches, and
sweets cannot be well digested when no bile enters the small intestine,
where they undergo conversion.These substances fermenting, much acid
results, and hence if a catarrh exist it is increased.An exclusive
diet of skimmed milk, kept up for two weeks or as long as possible, is
the best mode of alimentation for this part of the treatment.Afterward, the diet should be composed of milk, meat-broth, lemonade,
and subsequently of the succulent vegetables, acid fruits, and fresh
meat.Indulgence in malt liquors, wines, and spirits should be strictly
prohibited.A new method of treating jaundice has been lately proposed by
Krull,[38] which has the merit that no injury is done by it if no good
is accomplished.It consists in injecting into the rectum from two to
four pints of water at 60 degrees F., which is retained as long as
possible.Each time the injection is repeated the temperature is raised
a little.Krull reports that he has uniformly succeeded, and has never
found it necessary to repeat the injection more than seven times.It
may be given twice or thrice a day.[Footnote 38: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1877, p.STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF THE LIVER.DEFINITION.--An abnormal quantity of blood in the liver, constantly
present, constitutes hyperaemia or congestion.During the period of
repose there is less, but during the period of activity more, blood
circulating in the liver, but the physiological hyperaemia is not, nor
does it contribute to, a diseased state unless abnormal conditions
continue it beyond the proper limits.The term hyperaemia, here used,
applies to a pathological state in which various structural alterations
grow out of the continual congestion of the blood-vessels of the organ.CAUSES.--A physiological congestion of the liver ensues when the {984}
process of digestion is going on.The afferent vessels dilate, and not
only more blood, but various materials taken up from the foods and
products of digestion, many of them having directly stimulating
effects, also pass to the organ.Frequent and large indulgence in food,
especially if rich in quality and highly seasoned with spices, mustard,
etc., the consumption of malt liquors, wines, and alcoholic fluids in
general, the habitual use of strong coffee and tea, gradually induce a
state of hyperaemia.If to the consumption of a large quantity of
highly-stimulating food there is added the mischief of insufficient
waste, the danger of congestion of the liver is the greater.Persons
addicted to the pleasures of the table are apt to pursue sedentary
lives, and hence, besides the inappropriation of the material digested,
the process of oxidation is insufficient to burn off the surplus.A
sedentary life further tends to make the circulation in the hepatic
veins sluggish by lessening the number and depth of the respirations,
and with the obesity developed under these conditions the propelling
power of the heart is diminished by fatty degeneration or fatty
substitution of the cardiac muscle.Disease of the semilunar ganglion,
the solar plexus, and of the splanchnics under circumstances and of a
nature not now well understood may cause dilatation of the hepatic
vessels.Suppression of a long-existing hemorrhage from piles and from the
uterine system has caused hyperaemia of the liver.Evidences of hepatic
congestion are comparatively common about the menstrual period in
consequence of the tardy appearance of the flow, of its insufficiency,
or of its sudden suppression.There is a form of jaundice known as
icterus menstrualis, and attacks of hepatic congestion are not uncommon
at the climacteric period.The most important causes of hyperaemia of the liver are mechanical,
and consist in obstruction to the circulation in the ascending vena
cava from disease of the heart or lungs.Dilatation of the right
cavities, incompetence of the tricuspid, and stenosis of the mitral
orifice are the usual cardiac changes leading to congestion of the
liver.The same effect, to a much less extent, however, is produced by
any cause which weakens the propelling power of the heart, as
myocarditis, pericarditis, etc.Amongst the pulmonary lesions
obstructing the venous circulation are emphysema, interstitial and
croupous pneumonia, effusions into the pleura, intrathoracic aneurisms
or tumors, etc.It should not be forgotten that effusions into the left
pleura, as was demonstrated by Bartels[39] and confirmed by Roser,[40]
so push over the mediastinum toward the right and bend the vena cava in
the same direction, just as it emerges from the opening in the
diaphragm, that the circulation in this vessel is impeded, and
consequently congestion of the liver induced.[Footnote 39: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 40: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, Band vi.The influence of climate, especially of long-continued high
temperature, has been warmly disputed.On the whole, it seems probable
that in warm climates congestion of the liver is much more common.In the section on
Jaundice it was stated that this symptom may occur without the
phenomena of fever, and, indeed, without any other disturbance of the
system.In a large proportion of cases of intermittent fever, probably
in all, more or less congestion of the liver occurs.{985} PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Congestion may take place in the portal
system, and be due to conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, or in the hepatic vein and radicles, due to obstructive
troubles in the heart or lungs.Restricting the observations to the hyperaemia, and not including
subsequent lesions, it suffices to say that the liver is somewhat
enlarged, rather darker in color than the normal, and uniformly so; the
radicles and branches of the portal vein in the liver, the trunk of the
vein itself, and the veins of the spleen, stomach, intestines,
mesentery, etc.are distended with black blood, and the tissue of the
liver rather wet, inclined to soften, and here and there marked by
minute hemorrhages from rupture of small vessels.The extravasations of
blood accompany the hepatic congestion of hot climates, and probably
are the preludes to suppurative inflammation.The portal system the
more readily suffers from a passive congestion because of the provision
for the alternate expansion and contraction of the tunics of the
vessel, scantily supplied with contractile elements.An acute
congestion of the liver produced by sudden dilatation of the
capillaries of the hepatic artery has not been described, but it would
appear to be possible.The most important form of hepatic congestion is the mechanical,
arising from obstruction of the circulation in the heart or lungs.In
consequence of this obstruction the blood accumulates on the venous
side, and there is in consequence an ischaemia of the arterial side.The hepatic vein becomes distended, and its terminal radicle in the
centre of each acinus--the central vein--enlarges with the increased
pressure.It follows that the minute capillaries emptying into the
central vein are also distended with blood, and finally the portal vein
and its radicles throughout are similarly affected.The same condition
of the hepatic circulation was long ago observed by Virchow[41] as a
result of weakness of the muscular tissue of the heart, and
consequently diminished propelling power of the organ.On section of
the liver much black blood flows out; each central vein is a distinct
dark object in the centre of each acinus, and contrasts strongly with
the surrounding paler substance, whence the common term for this
appearance is nutmeg liver.The long-continued distension of the
central vein leads to sclerosis of its walls,[42] and the neighboring
hepatic cells undergo atrophy in consequence of the greater pressure.A
relatively increased quantity of connective tissue seems to result, but
whether hyperplasia occurs is disputed.By Talamon[43] such increase of
the connective tissue is denied, but Thierfelder[44] admits that there
is an apparent and also in some cases a real increase.The atrophy of
the cells induces more or less shrinking and consolidation of the
liver; it is therefore smaller in size and firmer in texture, and
presents a brownish-red color.The atrophic change in the hepatic cells
is represented finally by some brownish or black pigment, but it is
rare, indeed, for all the cells of an acinus to disappear.To this
change has been applied the term cyanotic atrophy.In some instances
Liebermeister[45] {986} has found an increase of the connective tissue
of the liver; and this opinion is confirmed by Legg.[46] When this
multiplication of the connective tissue occurs, the condition of the
liver is entitled cyanotic induration.The sclerosis originating in
this way is distinguished from true cirrhosis by its less extent,
irregularity, situation, and the marked degree of hepatic congestion.[Footnote 41: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band v. p.[Footnote 42: Talamon, _Recherches anatomo-pathologiques et cliniques

Leberkrankheiten_, Tubingen, 1864, p.209 _et seq._]

[Footnote 46: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--Hyperaemia of the liver is usually one of the complex
conditions of a morbid state, and hence is associated in its
symptomatology with the connected maladies.On the one hand associated
with gastro-intestinal disorders, on the other with cardiac and
pulmonary diseases, the symptoms must be varied accordingly.It is
necessary, however, to indicate as clearly as may be those belonging to
the hepatic circulation.Congestion of the portal circulation is a condition to which frequent
references are made, but which is rarely clearly defined.As seen in
the West and South, it signifies a gastro-intestinal catarrh more or
less acute, with an obvious condition of biliousness, as manifested in
a faint jaundiced tint of the skin and of the conjunctivae, uneasiness
in the right hypochondrium, with enlargement of the area of hepatic
dulness, the evacuations from the bowels being either grayish or
clay-, or more frequently bilious, acrid, and offensive.The gastro-intestinal disorder which initiates the hepatic disturbance
should not be confounded with that which succeeds to congestion of the
hepatic veins.The latter invariably comes on after the obstruction at
the heart or lungs has continued for some time.There occurs in this
state very extensive hyperaemia of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, and consequent disorders of stomachal and intestinal
digestion.The former is a reflex cause of disturbance, probably
through the intermediation of the solar plexus.The gastro-intestinal
irritation, by depressing the functions of the hepatic through the
solar plexus, induces a paresis of the muscular layer of the portal
system, and thus congestion ensues.Such a result is aided by high
temperature, but especially by the constitutional tendencies of some
subjects to hepatic disturbances.In such examples of hyperaemia the
symptoms consist of those belonging to gastro-intestinal catarrh,
succeeded by those referable to the liver, consisting in uneasiness,
heaviness, and fulness of the right hypochondrium, increase in the area
of hepatic dulness, soreness on pressure along the inferior margin of
the ribs and over the epigastric region, yellowness of the
conjunctivae, a fawn color of the skin generally, and high-
rather scanty urine, depositing abundantly uric acid and urates.A
liver considerably enlarged and projecting one or two fingers' breadths
below the ribs may be quickly relieved and return to the normal size on
the occurrence of hemorrhage from piles or after free watery
evacuations produced by a hydragogue cathartic.The form of hepatic congestion most usually observed is that of the
hepatic vein, caused by obstructive troubles of the heart or lungs, and
known as the nutmeg liver.The increase of size of the liver under
these circumstances may be very considerable.To determine an increase
in the area of hepatic dulness the position of the organ must be
ascertained with reference to the position of the body, whether
recumbent or erect.In the former position the liver gravitates toward
the thorax; in the {987} latter, downward into the abdomen.If
palpation only were employed to detect an increase in the size of the
organ, an error might readily be committed in this respect.Some
congestion may doubtless exist without an actual increase of size
recognizable by our means of investigation; there may be merely some
distension manifested by a sense of increased resistance; the liver may
project a hand's breadth below the ribs; and between these extremes
there may be all possible degrees of enlargement.When the liver, in
consequence of hyperaemia, projects below the ribs, it offers to the
sense of touch the impression of a smooth, elastic, rather rounded
surface, and not the hardness and nodular character of sclerosis, and
not the sharpness of border and hardness of texture belonging to
amyloid disease.The enlargement of the liver due to hyperaemia is
further distinguished by the fact that it varies much in size at
different times, and may be much reduced by hemorrhage from the portal
system, and increased suddenly by an attack of dyspnoea.When the liver is enlarged by hyperaemia the patient usually has a
distinct appreciation of the fact, feels a sense of weight, tenderness,
and oppression in the right hypochondrium, and experiences a painful
dragging from the right toward the left when turned on the left side.In some cases pain is felt in the shoulder, or, if not pain, a feeling
of weight.A slight icteroid hue of the conjunctiva, face, upper
extremities, and trunk is often present, but the stools are not wanting
in bile and the urine contains but little pigment--facts indicating
that the obstruction is limited to a small number of ducts.If the
jaundice is decided, the stools clay-, and the urine loaded with
pigment, a catarrhal swelling of the common or hepatic duct exists.As nutmeg liver is an incident in the course of the venous stasis from
cardiac or pulmonary obstructive disease, it is not unusual to find
ascites and general dropsy occur.When ascites precedes the other
manifestations of dropsy, and is relatively more important, the hepatic
congestion has led to atrophy of the cells and contraction of the
organ, or to cyanotic induration, as it has been designated in
contradistinction to cirrhotic induration.The subjects of hepatic congestion, especially of that form of the
malady due to gastro-intestinal irritation, are apt to experience no
little mental depression, even hypochondriasis, as, indeed, is usual in
most cases of hepatic disease.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The behavior of any case of
hyperaemia of the liver is determined, first, by the character of the
cause, and, secondly, by the extension of the mischief and the atrophic
changes which ensue.The congestion arising from gastro-intestinal
irritation is comparatively short-lived, since the causal conditions
may usually be promptly removed.It is far different in the cases due
to pulmonary or cardiac disease.If caused by a left pleuritic
exudation, the congestion will disappear as soon as the bend in the
ascending vena cava is removed by paracentesis.If, however, produced
by a permanent pulmonary obstruction, the course of the hepatic disease
is toward cyanotic induration.The same is true of obstructive cardiac
lesions.If compensation--as, for example, of a mitral
regurgitation--is not effected, the continual congestion must lead to
the ultimate lesions of the liver; but if compensation can be brought
about, the liver will be saved the irremediable {988} changes.The
prognosis, therapeutical and pathological, must necessarily be
dependent on the lesions of which the hyperaemia of the liver is merely
a symptom.DIAGNOSIS.--The decision in any case of hyperaemia of the liver must
rest on the determination of the gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, or
cardiac diseases causative.When, for example, to the gastro-intestinal
disturbance or cardiac disease there are added heaviness, uneasiness,
increased area of dulness of the right hypochondrium, a hyperaemia of
the liver may be concluded to exist.The extent to which the organ is
damaged may be judged from its size, the duration of the congestion,
and the character of the determining cause.If the area of hepatic
dulness declines steadily after having been increased, the causative
conditions continuing, the shrinking is due to atrophy.This view is
confirmed if ascites has appeared and increased out of proportion to
the general dropsy.TREATMENT.--Those cases of hyperaemia dependent on excesses in eating
and drinking require the substitution of a diet composed of lean meat,
skimmed milk, acid fruits, and such succulent vegetables as lettuce,
tomatoes, celery, etc.When there is a high degree of gastro-intestinal
catarrh, an absolute milk diet may be enforced with great advantage.enjoined in the section devoted to
lithaemia are equally applicable here.Amongst the special plans of
diet sometimes advocated in the condition of abdominal plethora or
portal congestion are the grape cure, the whey cure, etc.Great good is
accomplished by a simple diet and a course of the Saratoga saline
laxative waters--the Congress, Hathorn, Geyser, etc.The alkaline
waters of Wisconsin and Michigan, the White Sulphur of Virginia, and
others having similar properties in this country may be employed for
the same purpose.The saline laxatives, Pullna, Friedrichshall, and
other purgative salines, may be used in robust, plethoric subjects with
much portal congestion, hemorrhoids, etc.Phosphate of soda, given in
sufficient quantity to maintain a soluble state of the bowels, is also
a useful remedy.The resinous cathartics, podophyllin, jalap, rhubarb,
aloes, euonymin, iridin, baptisin, etc., are all useful when the
indication is to unload the portal circulation.The mercurials,
formerly so much used, are now discredited to an unwarranted degree.In
an irritable state of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane calomel in
small doses is remarkably useful.The treatment of congestion of the hepatic vein is included in that of
the lesion causing it.In some rather exceptional cases the liver
enlarges considerably in consequence of incompetence of the mitral,
without there being any other conspicuous evidence of the lesion.Remarkable relief is afforded to the hepatic symptoms by the
administration of digitalis.The important point in all cases due to
cardiac disease is to bring about compensation, and thus obviate the
consequences of the lesion.Remediable pulmonary affections should be
cured as promptly as possible, and the evil results of incurable
affections lessened by efforts to remove the hepatic hyperaemia.Careful alimentation, saline laxatives, and diuretics are the most
efficient measures.It would be encroaching on the subjects of
pulmonary and of cardiac diseases to enter more minutely into the
therapeutical questions connected with a symptom of these affections.DEFINITION.--By the term perihepatitis is meant an acute inflammation
of the serous envelope of the liver.It may be acute or chronic, very
rarely the latter, and it is usually a secondary affection, although
primary cases are not uncommon.PATHOGENY.--Inflammation of the hepatic portion of the peritoneum may
arise by an extension of the morbid process from neighboring parts, as
in perforation of the stomach or duodenum, pleuritis of that part of
the membrane reflected from the diaphragm, etc.More frequently it
arises by contiguity from some disease of the liver itself, as chronic
interstitial hepatitis, abscess, echinococci cysts, cancer, etc.The
author has frequently (comparatively) seen perihepatitis follow the
passage of gall-stones.It is usual to find considerable organized
exudation at the hilus of the liver in the case of those who have had
several attacks of hepatic colic, and attachments to various
neighboring parts also.In those instances of secondary hepatitis there
may be more or less extensive connective-tissue formation and
compression of the hepatic substance (Budd).[47]

[Footnote 47: _Diseases of the Liver_; also, Bamberger, _Krankheiten
des Chlylopoietic Systems_, p.Direct perihepatitis arises from traumatic causes--from contusions of
the right hypochondrium by spent balls, blows and falls, etc.Tight-lacing and wearing a strap to support the trousers are supposed
to excite a slow, chronic hepatitis, but the latter is more certain to
bring about such a result than the former.SYMPTOMS.--Acute perihepatitis, if of sufficient extent, causes more or
less fever; pain is felt in the right hypochondrium, and is increased
by pressure and by deep inspirations, and in some rare instances a
friction murmur is audible synchronous with the respiratory movements.These symptoms succeed to attacks of hepatic colic, perforation of the
stomach or intestine, and contusions of the abdominal wall.The chronic
form is not febrile; there is a feeling of soreness instead of acute
pain; pressure, the movements of the body, respiration, etc.increase
the distress, and on turning on the left side a painful dragging is
experienced.A slight degree of icterus may be present in both acute
and chronic cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of the acute cases is
toward recovery.In two or three days the inflammation reaches the
maximum, adhesions form, and then the morbid process declines.The
whole course of an acute perihepatitis caused by external injury or by
the passage of gall-stones is terminated in a week or ten days.The
mischief done may not be limited to the adhesions formed.The large
quantity of newly-organized connective tissue may, in its subsequent
contraction, compress the common, cystic, or hepatic duct, or the
portal, or both ducts and vein.The course of the chronic cases is
determined by the causative lesion.The contraction of the new-formed
connective tissue may compress the organ and lead to sclerotic changes
which cannot be distinguished from cirrhosis.In some instances
contusions set up suppurative inflammation, and an abscess forms
between the parietal and glandular layer of the peritoneum.Such a case
will then present the phenomena of hepatic abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the character of the case will be
{990} largely influenced by the history.If the attack has followed a
blow on the side or a paroxysm of hepatic colic or the symptoms of
perforation, there will be no difficulty in determining its seat and
character.In the absence of the history the differentiation must be
made between perihepatitis and pleuritis.The distinction consists in
the fact that in the former the pain and soreness are below the line of
respiratory sounds, although synchronous with them.In chronic
perihepatitis the symptoms come on in the course of the hepatic
disorder, or are consequent on a local injury, as the pressure of stays
or a band.TREATMENT.--If the symptoms are acute and the subject robust, the local
abstraction of blood by leeches affords relief and diminishes the
violence of the disease.A bandage should be tightly applied around the
body at the level of the hypochondrium to restrain the movements of the
affected organ.A turpentine stupe may be confined in this way, or a
compress of water may be utilized to serve the same purpose.If the
pain is acute and the peritonitis due to perforation or to the passage
of calculi, the hypodermatic injection of morphia is the most important
resource.Interstitial Hepatitis; Sclerosis of the Liver; Cirrhosis.DEFINITION.--The terms interstitial hepatitis and sclerosis of the
liver express the nature of the malady: they signify an inflammation of
the intervening connective tissue, resulting in a sclerosis--an
induration of the organ.The term cirrhosis, now so largely in use, was
originally proposed by Laennec[48] because of the yellowish tint of the
granulations, from the Greek word, [Greek: chirros], yellow.As
Laennec's theory of cirrhosis was erroneous, having regarded these
granulations as new formations, the word is a very faulty one, and
hence it would be preferable to use the term sclerosis, since a similar
change in other organs is thus designated, as sclerosis of the kidney,
sclerosis of the lungs, etc.It is also called in England gin-drinker's
liver, hobnail liver.Carswell[49] first described the anatomical
changes with accuracy, and illustrated them with correct drawings.The
following year Hallmann[50] confirmed the truth of Carswell's
descriptions, and contributed a good account of the morbid anatomy; and
subsequently French, German, and English authorities added new facts,
which will be set forth in the further discussion of the subject.[Footnote 48: _Traite de l'Auscultatlon mediate_, tome ii.[Footnote 49: _Illustrations of the Elementary Form of Diseases_,
fasciculus 10, plate 2.][Footnote 50: _De Cirrhosi hep._, Diss.Inaug., Berolini, 1839, quoted
by Thierfelder.]CAUSES.--Sclerosis of the liver is, conspicuously, a disease of adult
life and onward.Except the congenital example mentioned below, the
earliest age at which the disease has occurred, so far as I am able to
ascertain, is four years--a case reported by Wettergreen[51] of
hypertrophic sclerosis, in which neither a syphilitic nor paludal cause
could be ascertained.Cayley[52] reports a case in a child of six;
Murchison,[53] Frerichs,[54] Griffith,[55] one each at ten.After this
period the increase relatively to age is rapid.The majority of cases
occur between thirty {991} and fifty years.Yet Virchow[56] has given
the details of a congenital example.According to Forster, of 31 cases
of cirrhosis, 16 were between forty and sixty years.The preponderance
of cases in the male sex is very decided.Of Bamberger's 51 cases, 39
were men, 12 were women; of Frerichs' 36 cases, 20 occurred in men and
16 in women--a larger proportion of women than any other author
records; of 12 cases observed by myself, only 1 was a woman.Nationality does not affect the production of cirrhosis, except as
regards the personal habits of the people.This disease is
comparatively uncommon in wine- and beer-drinking countries, and
frequent amongst a spirit-drinking people.[57] The great etiological
factor is the abuse, the habitual use, of spirits, and hence the number
of cases observed in North Germany, England, Scotland, and the United
States.Murchison affirms that he has never seen a case produced in any
other way.Even in children of tender years the abuse of spirits can
usually be traced.Nevertheless, there are instances of the disease the
origin of which cannot be referred to alcoholic excess.The congenital
cases, as that narrated by Virchow, and the instances occurring in
children and adults not given to spirits in any form, indicate that
there are other pathogenetic influences which may bring about a
sclerosis of the liver.Virchow[58] was one of the first to illuminate
the subject of visceral syphilis and to demonstrate the occurrence of
sclerosis of the liver from syphilitic infection.Very often the
syphilitic cachexia coincides with alcoholic excess.There can be no
doubt that chronic malarial poisoning causes, or powerfully predisposes
to, cirrhosis.I have submitted elsewhere pathological evidence on this
point,[59] and the Italian physicians, who have the opportunity to
obtain accurate data, maintain that malarial toxaemia does bring about
this state.It is probable that the overgrowth of connective tissue is
induced by the repeated congestions of the malarial attacks, and by the
obstruction due to catarrh of the bile-ducts which so often occurs in
the febrile paroxysms.[Footnote 51: _Hygeia_, 1880, quoted by _London Medical Record_, March
15, 1881.][Footnote 52: _Transactions of the Path.[Footnote 53: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 54: _Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.[Footnote 55: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 56: _Archiv f. path.[Footnote 57: Baer, _Der Alcoholismus_, Berlin, 1878, p.62 _et seq._]

[Footnote 58: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.281; also, Lancereaux, _A
Treatise on Syphilis_, Syd.[Footnote 59: _Memoirs of the Sanitary Commission_, medical volume.]J. Wickham Legg[60] and Charcot[61] nearly simultaneously discovered
that obstruction of the bile-ducts, if continued a sufficient length of
time, sets up a hyperplasia of the connective tissue of the liver.Thus, Legg has seen a liver
markedly cirrhotic in a case where a small cancer of the duodenum
completely obstructed the flow of bile into the intestine.[62] By tying
the common duct in dogs it was found that a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue very soon occurred, and this was followed, of course,
by contraction of the new tissue and atrophy of the hepatic cells.Closure of the hepatic vein has the same effect, and also, as
Solowieff[63] has asserted, closure of the portal vein; on the other
hand, by Frerichs and others the closure of the portal is attributed to
the sclerosis.[Footnote 60: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.351 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 61: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.231 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 62: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.Anat., etc._, Band lxii.Certain poisons, as antimony, arsenic, notably phosphorus, have the
power to set up an irritative hyperplasia of the connective tissue of
the {992} liver.These metals accumulate in the liver in preparation
for excretion.Wegner,[64] in the study of the action of phosphorus on
dogs, rabbits, and other animals, has induced a marked degree of
sclerosis, but such results have not been observed in cases of
poisoning by phosphorus in man, except in an instance reported by
Kussner.[Footnote 64: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lv.Finally, a condition of the liver corresponding in all respects to
cirrhosis has been induced by perihepatitis, by the organization of the
exudation and its subsequent contraction, and by the extension of the
morbid process from the capsule to the interlobular connective tissue
(Poulin[65]).[Footnote 65: _Etude sur les Atrophies viscerales consecutives aux
Inflammations chroniques du Sereuses, etc._, These de Paris, 1880.]PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Several forms of cirrhosis are recognized by the
modern French school of pathologists.According to Sabourin,[66] there
is an annular, a monolobular, and a multilobular form.These differ
merely in regard to the arrangement of the new connective tissue.At
the outset of the disease the liver is increased in size and
hyperaemic.The outer
surface is at this period smooth, but on section the islets of the
parenchymatous tissue, yellowish in color, are distinctly visible
between the grayish or pale-rose tint of the intervening or
proliferating tissue.This reddish-gray material consists of fine
connective-tissue elements containing spindle-shaped cells.[67] The
development of this material is such as to even exceed in quantity the
proper glandular structure.The bands of newly-formed connective tissue
extend between individual lobules (monolobular cirrhosis) or between
groups of lobules (multilobular cirrhosis).A portion of the
spindle-shaped cells form new vessels communicating with the branches
of the hepatic artery.[68] Coincidently with the formation of the new
connective tissue ensues its contraction.The enlarged organ diminishes
in size from a slight degree to one-half its original volume;
especially in the left lobe is the diminution of size most marked.On
the surface it exhibits a knobbed or nodular aspect (hobnail liver),
and these knobs present through the capsule a yellow appearance.The
granulations, so called, consist of small prominences corresponding to
lobules or groups of lobules, and hence vary in size from that of a
pinhead to that of a pea.[69] Between these are the sharply-defined
masses of connective tissue.On section the organ is found to be of
firm almost cartilaginous hardness, and between the interlacing bundles
of connective tissue are the small islands of parenchymatous tissue
projecting above the cut surface and having a yellowish or
brownish-yellow color.As the terminal branches of the portal are
compressed in the process of shrinking undergone by the new connective
tissue, they are destroyed.The result of this obliteration of the
portal radicles is the impaired nutrition of the lobules and atrophy of
the cells.Formerly it was held that the atrophy of the hepatic cells
was due to the compression exercised by the contracting connective
tissue, and Beale[70] even maintained that the change began in {993}
the cells, the connective tissue contracting as the cells receded
before them.This view has been reaffirmed by Ackermann in a paper read
last year before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians, but
without any acknowledgment, so far as I can ascertain, of Beale's
long-before expressed opinions.In the discussion which followed the
reading of Ackermann's paper the position of its author was supported
by Aufrecht, Kussner, and others, but controverted by Rindfleisch.It
has been demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten[71] that the lobule is
nourished not only by the portal radicles, but by the branches of the
hepatic artery, which enter, by the interlobular vein, the capillaries
of the lobule, and hence the nutrition of the cells suffers in
consequence of the lessened blood-supply; but it is probable also that
more or less compression is exercised.When the cells are destroyed,
their remains may be discerned in the mass of connective tissue as fine
fat-granules or masses of pigment yellowish or brownish in color.The
peculiar appearance to which the name cirrhosis is applied is due to
the lobules or groups of lobules which project on section above the
divided surface, and are  yellowish by the bile-pigment, which
here exists in an exaggerated quantity.The cells themselves are not
normal: they are enlarged by compensatory hypertrophy, and they contain
much bile-pigment and a considerable quantity of fat.The compression
of the capillaries, especially their obliteration, leads to stasis of
the blood and its consequences in the whole chylopoietic system.Sabourin, "Du Role que joue le Systeme veineux

SYMPTOMS.--The development of sclerosis is usually very insidious.After some years' indulgence in spirit-drinking or affected for a
length of time with the other causes of the malady, a gradual decline
of vigor occurs.The complexion takes on a fawn color, stigmata slowly
form on the face, there is more or less yellowness of the conjunctiva,
and attacks of headache, giddiness, and even severe vertigo, are
experienced.An increasing indisposition to mental effort, some
hebetude of mind, and a gradually deepening despondency are felt.The
appetite gradually fails, becomes capricious, and only highly-seasoned,
rather odd, or unusual articles of food can be taken.Such subjects
acquire a taste for condiments, for such uncooked vegetables as onions,
celery, raw cabbage, etc., for fruits, and get a distaste for
plainly-cooked meats and vegetables, for sweets, etc.The digestion is
as capricious as the appetite: at first there are times of appetite,
again of indifference, then of disgust; some heaviness is felt after
meals; gaseous eructations, acidity, pyrosis, nausea, occur day after
day as the case advances; and ultimately morning vomiting is regularly
experienced.Nausea is felt on rising; then with much straining and
distress a little glairy mucus and a teaspoonful of bile are brought
up; after which, it may be, a little food can be taken.It is only
after the case is fully declared that these troubles of stomach
digestion become constant; previously they occur now and then in a
paroxysmal way, whilst between there is only labored digestion.As the compression of the portal radicles maintains, by reason of the
obstruction, a constant hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane, a
catarrhal state, with fermentation of the fatty, starchy, and
saccharine constituents of the food, and hence complicated products of
an irritating kind, must result therefrom.Hemorrhoids, varying in size
according to {994} the degree of obstruction, form, sometimes bleeding
more or less profusely, again being merely troublesome or painful.Fissures of the anus and fistula in ano not unfrequently complicate the
case.The bowels are necessarily rather relaxed than confined, but at
the onset of the malady they may be confined, afterward assuming more
or less of the characteristics of diarrhoea.The stools may be
offensive with the products of decomposition, rather clay- or
golden, or brownish and almost black from the presence of blood.In
some cases the stools are parti---clay- in part, brownish
in part--and in exceptional examples continue normal or nearly so until
near the end.As the transudations from the portal vessels increase,
the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal becomes oedematous, and,
the normal secretions being arrested, the discharges finally consist of
a watery fluid, whitish or grayish, dark-brown or blackish, and very
offensive.The decomposition of foods instead of their proper digestion
and solution, and especially the fermentation of the starchy and
saccharine constituents of the aliment taken, produce a great quantity
of gas; hence meteorism comes to be an ordinary symptom.The
accumulation of gas is greatly promoted by the paretic state of the
muscular layer and by the relaxation of the abdominal walls consequent
on the oedema of the muscular tissue.A high degree of distress is
sometimes caused by the great accumulation of flatus; the abdomen is
greatly distended and the diaphragm is pushed up against the heart and
lungs, compelling the patient at length to sit up to breathe with ease.Of course the accumulation of fluid may be greater, and the gas only
add to the discomfort.Sometimes it happens, indeed, that
this is the only evidence of the portal obstruction at first observed.Haematemesis is more common than intestinal hemorrhage.Now the blood
may be large in quantity, appear little changed from its usual
coagulated state, and be brought up promptly with slight effort of
vomiting; now it is passed by stool, is in coffee-, granular
masses or in a tar-like, semifluid state; and again it appears in
coffee-grounds mixed with the contents of the stomach.These variations
are due to the character, seat, and extent of the hemorrhage and to the
condition of the mucous membrane.Merely-distended capillaries,
yielding, may furnish a little blood, which, acted on by the gastric
juice, forms coffee-grounds, or, if not acted on in consequence of the
failure of the gastric glands to functionate, appears as bloody streaks
mixed with mucus.Enlarged veins, giving way, may furnish a large
quantity of partly-coagulated venous blood, charred or not as the state
of the juices will determine.In some cases hemorrhages into the
submucous tissue or thromboses of the submucous veins lead to solution
of the membrane thus deprived of its nutritional supply, and ulcers
form.Two admirable examples of this kind have been seen by the writer
in which large haematemesis occurred from ulcers near the pylorus.They
were round, smooth ulcers, containing coagula, and the eroded vessels
(veins) were readily seen opening into the cavity of each.The obstruction to the portal circulation results also in an
enlargement of the spleen.There may be a simple enlargement due to the
hyperaemia merely; there may be an enlargement due to the hyperaemia
and to a resulting hyperplasia of the connective tissue; there may be
also, in {995} addition to the second form of enlargement, amyloid
degeneration, syphilitic hyperplasia, etc.The increased dimensions of
the spleen are by no means always made out, and authorities differ
greatly as to the proportion of cases in which the enlargement can be
detected.The organ may indeed be considerably enlarged whilst pushed
upward into the left hypochondrium by the effusion, and yet the attempt
to measure and define its dimensions may be fruitless.From a slight
increase due to the hyperaemia up to the enormous dimensions acquired
by the added amyloid material there are all possible variations in
size.Partly in consequence of the increased blood-pressure in the vessels of
the peritoneum, and partly in consequence of the watery condition of
the blood itself, effusion takes place into the sac of the peritoneum.Such an accumulation is known as ascites, or dropsy of the abdomen.The
time at which the effusion begins, the amount of it, and the degree of
contraction of the liver necessary to produce it, vary in each case.Ascites may be the first symptom to announce the onset of cirrhosis; it
is more frequently amongst the later symptoms, and is the evidence of
much interference in the portal circulation.However, it is not due
wholly to hepatic disease.The blood in cirrhosis is much reduced and
watery, hence slight causes suffice to induce an outward diffusion.Given a certain obstacle to the passage of the blood through the liver,
transudation will be the more prompt to appear the greater the anaemia.In some cases an enormous quantity of fluid collects: from ten to
thirty pounds may be regarded as usual, and forty to sixty pounds as
exceptional, although the highest amount just given is not rare.The
fluid of ascites nearly represents the serum of the blood.It has a
straw color and is clear, but it may have a reddish tint from the
presence of blood, a greenish-yellow or brown from bile-pigment.The
solids of the serum are in the proportion of from 1 to 3 per cent., and
consist of albumen chiefly and salts, of which sodium chloride is the
principal.Hoppe's[72] analysis gives this result: 1.55 to 1.75 solids,
of which 0.62 to 0.77 is albumen.According to Frerichs, the amounts of
solids ranges from 2.04 to 2.48, and of these albumen constitutes 1.01
to 1.34.[Footnote 72: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band ix.]Oedema of the inferior extremities comes on after, usually--rarely
with--the ascites.If the mechanism of this oedematous swelling be as
supposed, the effusion into the areolar tissue necessarily succeeds to
the abdominal effusion.The pressure of the fluid in the cavity on the
ascending vena cava and iliac veins seems to be the principal factor;
but to this must also be added the intestinal gas, which in some
instances exerts a powerful force.The ankles have in rather rare cases
appeared swollen before the abdomen, but the detection of fluid in the
peritoneal cavity when in small quantity is not always easy.Obese
women, with much accumulation of fat in the omentum and flatus in the
intestines, have swollen feet and legs if erect for some time, the
effusion being due to pressure on the vena cava.The legs may become
enormously distended.The scrotum and penis in the male, the vulva in
the female, the buttocks and the abdominal wall, also become
oedematous, sometimes immensely.Warmth and moisture and the friction of the sensitive surfaces excite
vesicular and pustular eruptions where the {996} scrotum and labiae
come in contact with the thighs.Urination may be impeded by the oedema
of the prepuce.An attempt at compensation for these evils growing out of the
obstruction in the portal system is made by the natural powers.Anastomoses of veins through minute branches are made use of to convey
the blood of the obstructed portal circulation into the general venous
system, and to this end become greatly enlarged.The interlobular veins
being obliterated by the contracting connective tissue, the pressure in
the branches and trunk of the portal vein is much increased.Hence an
outlet is sought for in the veins which communicate between the portal
and the ascending vena cava.One of the most important of these is a
vein in the round ligament, at one time supposed to be the closed
umbilical vein, but proved by Sappey to be an accessory portal vein.Bamberger,[73] however, has found the umbilical vein pervious, and
since, Hoffmann[74] has demonstrated the same fact.It is probable,
indeed, that Sappey's observation is correct for some cases.In either
event, the veins of the abdominal wall about the umbilicus
communicating with the epigastric become enormously distended, and in
some advanced cases of cirrhosis form a circle known as the caput
Medusae.Further communication between the portal and the veins of the
diaphragm takes place by means of the veins in the coronary and
suspensory ligaments.In some instances a new route is established
between the veins of the diaphragm and the portal by means of new
vessels formed in the organized connective tissue resulting from
perihepatitis.Still another channel of communication exists between
the inferior oesophageal veins, the azygos, and the coronary, and
finally between the inferior hemorrhoidal and the hypogastric.The more
completely can communication be established between these anastomosing
veins the less severe the results of portal obstruction.[Footnote 73: _Krankheiten des Chylopoiet.cit._]

[Footnote 74: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

Besides these indirect evidences of portal obstruction and a
contracting organ, there are direct means of ascertaining the condition
of the liver.By the methods of physical diagnosis we may acquire much
information.On auscultation, as our Jackson[75] was the first to show,
a grating or creaking like leather, or friction sound, is audible over
the right hypochondrium synchronously with the respiratory movements or
when produced by moving with the fingers the abdominal wall on the
liver.This sound is caused by the bands of false membrane which extend
between the two surfaces, and hence indicates a secondary
perihepatitis.[Footnote 75: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850.]To ascertain the dimensions of the liver--to mark out the area of
hepatic dulness--with accuracy is a most necessary procedure.The
period of the disease is an important element in the problem.When the
new material is deposited and the congestion of the portal system first
occurs, an increase in the dimensions of the organ is observed.This
enlargement, of brief duration, must not be confounded with the
hypertrophic sclerosis, another form of the malady.So considerable is
the increase in the size of the liver that there is an evident
enlargement of the right hypochondrium, and the whole abdomen seems
fuller.The organ may be felt, on palpation, projecting one, two, or
even three fingers' breadths below the margin of the ribs, and the left
lobe extends well across the epigastrium, increasing the sense of
resistance and the area {997} of dulness in this direction.The
enlarged liver, as felt below the ribs, appears firmer than is natural,
is yet smooth, and the margin is sharply defined.The duration of this
period of enlargement is indefinite, but it is rather brief, and is
followed by the contracting and atrophic stage.It is not often,
indeed, that the patient presents himself during the period of
enlargement.Sometimes a perihepatitis or an unwonted tenderness in the
right side compels attention during this stage, but more frequently it
escapes notice.If perihepatitis occur, there will be fever, pain, and
tenderness, a slight icterode hue of the skin, and possibly
Jackson's[76] friction sound.These symptoms, taken in conjunction with
the history of the case and the obvious enlargement of the organ, will
indicate the existence of the first stage of sclerosis.[Footnote 76: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850, _supra_.]The contraction of the liver, or, as it may be expressed, the atrophy
of the hepatic cells and the consequent shrinking of the interlobular
connective tissue, goes on slowly.Several months may be occupied in an
amount of atrophy distinct enough to be recognized by the narrowing of
the area of hepatic dulness.Especially difficult is the recognition of
the contraction when ascites has fully distended the abdomen.It may be
necessary under such circumstances to postpone a decision until tapping
has removed the fluid.If the organ can be felt by depressing the walls
of the abdomen, more or less unevenness of surface may be detected, and
the inferior margin may give the impression of hardness and sharpness
of outline.At the same time, the increased dulness of the epigastric
region observed during the hypertrophic stage will have gradually
ceased because of the shrinking of the left lobe.The liver may be
undergoing the atrophic degeneration to a marked extent and yet remain
large--larger even than normal.Such a state of things may be due to
conjoint amyloid or fatty degeneration of the organ, and, indeed, more
or less fatty change occurs in all cases of cirrhosis.The shrinking of
the liver persists until the area of dulness is not greater in area
than two or three ribs.The disturbances of function in sclerosis of the liver are not limited
to the chylopoietic system.As the secreting structure of the liver is
continually lessened in extent by the atrophy, symptoms result from the
necessary interference in the hepatic functions.These symptoms are
concerned with the liver, with the nutrition of the tissues of the
body, and with the kidneys.As regards the biliary function of the
liver, the quantity of bile acids and pigment is reduced below the
normal in proportion to the damage done to the organ.As a rule, there
is little jaundice in sclerosis, and very little bile-pigment present
in the urine.Instead of a
jaundiced hue of the skin, it has a fawn color--an earthy, sallow tint
eminently characteristic of a chronic affection in which the power to
produce bile is much impaired.Occasionally it happens, particularly in
the early stages of cirrhosis, that a well-marked jaundice appears in
the face and body, but this probably is due to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.In most cases the integument presents the earthy and sallow
hue above mentioned.Graves[77] appears to have been the first to
interpret aright the greater significance of this appearance of the
skin than the purely jaundiced tint.The glycogenic {998} function of
the liver must be impaired in the same ratio as the biliary.The
nutrition of the body suffers; the skin becomes dry and harsh; the fat
disappears; the temperature of the body, unless the conditions for
producing fever are present, is barely up to normal, if not somewhat
below; a marked degree of anaemia supervenes; and the action of the
heart becomes feeble and rapid after a period of slowness.The blood is
altered in quality, and hence hemorrhages--epistaxis especially--occur,
petechiae and ecchymoses appear in the skin, and stigmata are numerous
about the face and nose.[Footnote 77: _Clinical Medicine_, _op.cit._]

The urine in cirrhosis is high- because of the abundance of
pigment, and in the early stages of the disease is increased in amount,
although of lower specific gravity.When much effusion takes place into
the peritoneal sac, the compression of the renal veins by the fluid
lessens the activity of the kidneys and diminishes the urinary flow.Much discussion has taken place over the quantity of urea present in
the urine in cases of cirrhosis, but it has been established that the
relative quantity of urea lessens in proportion to the damage suffered
by the liver.[78] The urates are in excess.[Footnote 78: Charcot, _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, _loc.252; also, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree dans les Maladies du
Foie_, par F. Genevoix, Paris, 1876; _Des Rapports de l'Uree avec le
Foie_, par A. Martin, Paris, 1877; _Sur l'Uree et ces Variations dans
la Cirrhose_, These de Paris, Audiguier; _Contribution a l'Etude du
Role du Foie dans la Product.de l'Uree_, Reufflet.]COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--There are enormous variations in
the course of the disease as respects the rate of its progress.In
general, it may be said that the whole duration is from three months to
six years.The onset is often insidious, and little distress is
occasioned until effusion begins in the abdomen.In other cases there
is considerable pain in the right hypochondrium, severe disorders of
digestion and intestinal derangements, rapid emaciation, ascites, and
some intercurrent malady which terminates them, often quite
unexpectedly.The usual course is as follows: After the protracted use
of alcoholic stimulants the symptoms of gastro-intestinal catarrh
appear; there occur acidity, pyrosis, morning vomiting, and distress
after meals; the bowels are irregular, the stools rather dark and
offensive; the bodily vigor declines and the mental condition is
depressed and hypochondriacal; emaciation progresses; the skin becomes
dry, harsh, and fawn-; stigmata appear on the face; some
uneasiness is felt in the abdomen, through the right hypochondrium, and
about the umbilicus; presently the abdomen enlarges and the feet and
legs swell; after a time the abdominal enlargement is extreme and the
walls become thin, the genitals and thighs are greatly distended, and
the prepuce is so swollen that urination grows more and more difficult,
the penis almost disappearing in the surrounding oedema;
notwithstanding the immense size of the abdomen and lower extremities,
the chest, face, and upper extremities are wasted away; to lie down is
impossible, and only snatches of disturbed sleep are procured in the
upright sitting posture; breathing grows more and more difficult, and a
sense of suffocation is imminent; and, thus worn out by suffering and
want of sleep, the patient at last sinks into a soporose state and dies
comatose, if not cut off before by some acute serous
inflammation--pleuritis, peritonitis, peri- or endocarditis, pneumonia,
etc.{999} The course of any case of cirrhosis is much influenced by the
amount of damage to the hepatic cells and by the extent of the
compensatory changes in the circulation.Ulcers of the stomach or
intestine, opening vessels, or hemorrhages from the mucous membranes
may have a pronounced effect on the progress of any case.A fatal
result was determined in a case under the writer's charge by hemorrhage
from ulcers near the pylorus, which were caused by thromboses of the
stomach veins at that point.Occasionally, the occurrence of thrombosis
of the portal vein adds an embarrassing and dangerous complication.The
liver, besides the change due to cirrhosis, may be affected by amyloid
or fatty degeneration, or by both combined.It should not be forgotten
that more or less fatty change takes place in the hepatic cells
undergoing atrophy, whence the appearance called cirrhosis.Sclerosis
may be a general condition in which several organs participate, the
kidneys notably.These organs are changed by a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue, and especially by fatty degeneration of the
epithelium.In the brain the sclerosis consists in chronic
pachymeningitis, adhesions of the dura, etc., and with these
connective-tissue changes are often associated extravasations of blood.These lesions are probably due to chronic alcoholism rather than to the
cirrhosis--are simultaneous lesions, instead of consecutive.The duration of cirrhosis must necessarily depend largely on the
occurrence of the complications above mentioned and on the appearance
of intercurrent diseases.The most usual intercurrent maladies are
peritonitis, pleuritis, and other serous inflammations.An attack of
cerebral (meningeal) hemorrhage may occur.Failure of the heart may be
due to fatty degeneration of its muscular tissue.Stupor, coma, and
insensibility may come on toward the close in consequence of the
retention of excrementitious matters.By Flint, Jr., these cerebral
symptoms were referred to the retained cholesterin, and hence he
designated this state cholesteraemia.Numerous experimentalists
(Pages,[79] Chomjakow,[80] Von Krusenstern,[81] Koloman Muller[82])
have studied this question, and only Muller has been able to confirm
Flint's theory.The condition is more suitably designated cholaemia,
which signifies blood-poisoning from the excrementitious biliary
matters retained in the system.[Footnote 79: Quoted by Legg, p.[Footnote 80: Quoted by Krusenstern.][Footnote 81: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxv.[Footnote 82: _Archiv fur experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie_,
Band i. p.Any fully-developed case of cirrhosis can only terminate in one way,
for we possess no means of restoring the hepatic cells when once
destroyed.At the outset of the disease, before any serious changes
have taken place, it is probable it may be arrested.Proceeding to its
natural termination without complications or intercurrent affections,
death finally occurs from exhaustion.The emaciation becomes extreme,
the stomach gets to be excessively irritable, and an exhausting
diarrhoea consumes the last remains of strength.Then an oedema of the
lungs or failure of the heart or a deep coma ends the scene.DIAGNOSIS.--Cirrhosis in its first stage is to be distinguished from
diseases which cause enlargement of the liver, and in its second or
contracting stage from diseases that induce contraction of the organ.The history of alcoholic excess is an important means of
differentiating this {1000} from other affections.The enlargement
belonging to alcoholism is distinguished from that due to amyloid
disease by the permanent character of the latter and by its history of
chronic suppuration, in addition to, it may be, alcoholic excess; from
cancer, by the character of the enlargement, by its permanence, by the
secondary deposits in the mesentery and elsewhere, by the severe and
persistent pain; from hydatids or echinococci cysts by the painless
enlargement of the latter, by the absence, usually, of any interference
with the hepatic functions, by the purring thrill, and by the presence
of the characteristic hooklets in the fluid withdrawn.From the
maladies characterized by the contraction of the organ it is
distinguished by the rapidity with which the case is developed in acute
yellow atrophy, and by the profound constitutional disturbance
characteristic of this form of contraction.When the liver is lessened
in size in consequence of the compression exercised by the contracting
exudation of a local peritonitis, there is a history of pain and
soreness of the right hypochondrium, followed by the symptoms of
contraction--a very different history from that of cirrhosis, in which
the local attacks of pain and distress succeed to or accompany the
symptoms of contraction.Occlusion of the gall-ducts by a calculus may
set up a slow atrophy having some points of resemblance to cirrhosis;
but in this malady attacks of hepatic colic precede the signs of
obstruction, the jaundice, and gray evacuations, and the evidences of
contraction succeed to these very characteristic symptoms; whereas in
cirrhosis paroxysms of pain followed by jaundice are not known.Occlusion of the portal vein may also be followed by atrophy, but this
is usually due to some other affection of the abdominal organs, and the
change in the condition of the liver occurs very promptly, there being
neither the history nor the course of symptoms belonging to cirrhosis.TREATMENT.--As the abuse of alcoholic liquors--even their habitual use
in moderation--is the chief pathogenetic factor, they should be
entirely given up.Condiments, coffee and tea, highly-seasoned animal
foods, are of less importance as causes, but are sufficiently injurious
to require them to be discontinued.The food of such subjects should
not contain fat, because the bile is necessary to its right
assimilation, and should have but a small proportion relatively of
starch and sugar, since these articles readily ferment in the presence
of an excess of mucus and in the absence of the bile.The succulent
vegetables, as lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., should be substituted
for the starchy and saccharine.A diet largely composed of skimmed milk
renders an important service both as a nutrient and a diuretic and
depurant.Lean meats, acid fruits, and the weak alkaline mineral waters
should be the basis of a proper system of alimentation.As malarial intoxication is a cause now distinctly recognized, patients
should be removed from such influences.If this be impracticable, the
effects of the poison should, as far as possible, be removed,
especially the glandular complications.To this end, such remedies
should be employed as will affect the overgrowth of the connective
tissue, as the compound solution of iodine, the bichloride of mercury,
and the chloride of gold (or gold and sodium).Quinine will be
necessary, according to circumstances.Do we possess any means to check the overgrowth of connective tissue
{1001} in cases of sclerosis?The writer believes that those remedies
have this power to a less or greater extent which are separated by the
liver from the blood.These are chiefly the salts of gold, silver,
copper, arsenic, and mercury (chloride), and phosphorus.The most
useful of these are the chloride of gold and sodium and the chloride of
mercury, and some phosphates.The writer has had, he thinks, curative
results in the commencement of the disease from the chloride of gold
and sodium and the phosphate of sodium.German practitioners believe
that the chloride of ammonium is a powerful alterant and deobstruent,
and prescribe it in this affection to stop the overgrowth of connective
tissue.That it does have this effect can hardly be disputed, but the
daily quantity necessary is large, the taste very disagreeable, and the
stomachal effect that of an irritant.Hence it is by no means so
effective as the chlorides above mentioned.The chloride of gold and
sodium (1/10 grain) can be given at the same time with chloride of
mercury (1/20 grain) if it is desirable to combine their effects.The
writer has seen what appeared to be cases of cirrhosis in the first
stage yield to the persistent administration of phosphate of
sodium--drachm j ter in die--and the chloride of gold and sodium.When contraction of the liver has ensued, and hemorrhages, effusion
into the cavity of the peritoneum, and a high degree of
gastro-intestinal catarrh have occurred, the relief of the secondary
symptoms takes the first place in importance.There are but three modes
by which an effusion into the abdomen can be removed: by the skin, by
the kidneys, by the intestinal canal.Each of these may be employed in
turn.By the skin warm baths, vapor baths, digitalis stupes, and
especially the subcutaneous injection of pilocarpin, may be employed.These alone may be sufficient in some cases--rather rarely, however.They may all be used simultaneously or in turn to effect the purpose.A
digitalis stupe may be made to have the effect of a vapor bath: a large
one is placed on the abdomen and the body is covered with blankets,
which results in the production of abundant sweating.The vapor bath is
applied in the ordinary way, so that no explanation is needed.If there
be no contraindication in the state of the heart, pilocarpin salts can
be injected in sufficient quantity to induce active diaphoresis.These
measures proving inadequate, an attempt should be made to dispose of
the fluid by acting on the kidneys and promoting diuresis.Amongst the
diuretics in ascites, Wilks places the resin of copaiba first.The dose
ranges from two to five grains, and it may be given in combination with
gold or mercury chloride.When this remedy increases the flow of urine,
it does good, but if the quantity of urine remains unchanged, it does
no good, and should be discontinued.As the effusion of fluid is due to the portal obstruction, it follows
that depletion of the terminal radicles of this system will act most
directly on the origin of the troubles.Hydragogue cathartics have,
therefore, an important place in the treatment of ascites of hepatic
origin.One of the most generally efficient of these remedies is the
compound jalap powder, for whilst it produces free watery evacuations,
it also stimulates the kidneys somewhat.It is generally better to give
a full dose--one or two teaspoonfuls--in the early morning, so that the
disturbance caused by it will subside before the time for taking food.Several free watery evacuations should be produced by it.Sometimes the
resin or extract of podophyllin is added to the compound jalap powder
to increase its activity.{1002} Purgative combinations of colocynth,
gamboge, and resin of podophyllin are also occasionally employed, but
the most efficient hydragogue is elaterium.The last-mentioned may act
very efficiently without causing any considerable depression, but the
results obtained by it are usually fleeting.After even a very free
discharge of fluid the effusion quickly increases, and further
purgation is required.Tapping is a palliative expedient which must
sometimes be considered.With the present improved aspirator and the
antiseptic method the fluid may be withdrawn with ease and safety.It
is not necessary in any case to remove all the fluid--merely that
quantity which will relieve the pressure on the diaphragm and on the
renal vessels.The author has seen general peritonitis result from
tapping.As such a complication will increase all the difficulties of a
case, it is very desirable to prevent it by careful application of the
antiseptic method and sealing of the punctured orifice to prevent the
entrance of germs.In the protracted cases of cirrhosis there ensues, finally, a highly
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, the bowels become very
irritable, and frequent offensive and watery discharges occur.If under
these circumstances the abdominal effusion increases, the remedies must
consist of diuretics and diaphoretics rather than purgatives.Indeed,
an exhaustive colliquative diarrhoea may require bismuth, copper, and
other astringents, combined with opium, to prevent the patient passing
into the condition of collapse.Hemorrhage by vomiting or by stool will
demand ice, subsulphate of iron, ipecac, ergotin in the form of
subcutaneous injection especially, and other remedies which have been
found useful in gastric or intestinal hemorrhage.Topical remedies are not without utility if used early.When the
changes in the liver are secondary to peritonitis of the hepatic
portion, the application of leeches and cups renders an important
service.At any time during the course of cirrhosis wet or dry cups may
be used with advantage whenever local pain, tenderness, and a catching
respiration indicate the extension of mischief to the peritoneum.The
tincture of iodine or flying blisters, or both in turn, may be applied
over the right hypochondrium after cups and leeches, or at any time
when local distress indicates the need of counter-irritants.Probably
the most efficient topical application during the hypertrophic stage of
cirrhosis is the official ung.A piece the size
of a large pea should be thoroughly rubbed in over the hepatic region
daily until some irritation of the skin is produced.When this
irritation has subsided the applications should be renewed.Suppurative Hepatitis; Abscess of the Liver.DEFINITION.--Suppurative hepatitis is an acute inflammation of the
hepatic parenchyma, terminating in suppuration.The inflammation may be
primary or due to local conditions entirely, or it may arise from
morbid processes occurring in parts or organs in anatomical relation to
the liver.CAUSES.--Climate exercises an unquestionable influence in the
production of hepatic abscess.Those warm countries visited by
dysentery, {1003} says Lombard,[83] are almost exclusively affected by
this disease.Hirsch,[84] whilst recognizing the influence of climate,
shows that the natives are not affected to the same extent as are
Europeans.Both writers maintain that hepatic abscess does not occur
frequently in the corresponding parallels of latitude in the United
States; which is true of the Atlantic border, but is not correct for
the interior continent, the valley of the Mississippi, and its
tributaries.In this vast region the conditions for the production of
hepatitis exist abundantly.The mean annual temperature, the
malaria-breeding soil, the social and personal habits of the people
(males), combine to favor the production of hepatic abscess.As the
native population and females in tropical countries are not affected,
there must be other influences to the action of which the high
temperature contributes.The rich and highly-seasoned food in which
Europeans indulge and the large consumption of alcoholic drinks are
doubtless responsible in a large measure for the occurrence of this
malady in such excessive proportions amongst them.[Footnote 83: _Traite de Climatologie medicale_, tome iv.[Footnote 84: _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen Pathologie_, Band
ii.Sex has a remarkable influence in securing immunity against hepatic
abscess.According to the statistics of Rouis,[85] of 258 cases of
hepatic abscess, only 8 were in women.He rightly enough attributes
this exemption rather to the difference in habits of the two sexes than
to any merely sexual peculiarity.In 12 cases observed by the writer,
only 1 was in a woman.In Waring's[86] collection of 300 fatal cases of
tropical dysentery, only 9 occurred in women.These facts are most
conclusive regarding the relatively greater frequency of the affection
in men.As might be expected, the age at which this disease occurs is
the period of adult life, when exposure to the conditions developing it
is most likely to happen.In general, then, hepatic abscess may be
referred to the period mentioned by Rouis--from twelve to seventy-five
years of age.In my own cases the youngest was eleven years and the
oldest fifty-four years of age.It is not the broken-down subject of
mature age or the weakling of youth who is attacked by hepatic abscess,
but the more vigorous and able-bodied, who have, because of their
strength and activity, been exposed to the manifold conditions
producing it.[Footnote 85: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie
d'apres des Observations recueilles dans le Nord de l'Afrique_, par J.
L. Rouis, Paris, 1860, p.[Footnote 86: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology of Some
Points connected with Abscess of the Liver_, by Ed.John Waring,
Resident Surgeon of Travancore, 1854, p.Rouis finds that a combination of the lymphatic and nervous
temperaments seems most favorable to the production of this malady.It
is certain that those who have the bodily conditions influential in the
formation of gall-stones are not unfrequently attacked by abscess.The
passage of the calculi may induce a local peritonitis of considerable
severity; their arrest in the duct, with the result of ulcerating
through, producing peritonitis and adhesions, are conditions
eventuating in the formation of an abscess always large and sometimes
of enormous size.Under such circumstances the element of temperament
has a secondary place in the aggregate of causes.Not very often hepatic abscess results from external blows, contusions,
and from penetrating wounds.The liver is so placed as to glide aside
when a blow is inflicted on the right hypochondrium, and thus escapes
{1004} direct compression.An injury which elsewhere would have but
little effect may excite suppurative inflammation in the tropical--or,
as it may be entitled, the hepatic--abscess zone.Climatic conditions,
or the changed habits of Europeans in tropical and subtropical regions,
exert a distinct influence in traumatic cases.The most important causes of hepatic abscess exist in the state of the
portal vein, hepatic artery, and the hepatic veins.In the valley of
the Mississippi and its tributaries, where abscess of the liver is a
comparatively common disease, it has been found that in a large
proportion of the cases the initial stage is an affection of the
rectum--a form of dysentery properly entitled proctitis.So far as this
vast region is concerned, the intestinal disease which precedes abscess
of the liver, and stands in a causative relation to it, is an affection
of the mucous membrane from which the inferior hemorrhoidal veins
arise.This disease, although having a dysenteric form, is not ordinary
dysentery.The onset of the disease and its symptomatic expression are
those of a mild affection of the mucous membrane of the rectum--so
insignificant in some cases as to be recalled with difficulty.In
tropical countries abscess of the liver may be associated with
dysenteric ulcerations.This relation has been frequently observed, but
is far from constant.In Waring's[87] cases, which occurred in India,
31 per cent.of the fatal cases of hepatic abscess arose during the
course of acute or chronic dysentery.De Castro of Alexandria[88] finds
that dysentery is the most frequent cause of abscess in that region,
especially in the Greek hospital.Murchison[89] considers tropical
abscess of the liver as secondary to dysentery in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but by no means in all.In non-tropical
countries abscess of the liver is found to succeed to ulcerations of
the stomach, the intestines, the bile-ducts, etc.In the case of
ulceration of any part of the mucous membrane from which the portal
vein receives branches a morbific material may be conveyed to the
liver.This morbific material may be some unknown septic principle the
presence of which in the liver will excite suppurative inflammation; it
may consist of an embolus having septic power or a merely mechanical
irritant; it may be micrococci or some other living organisms, which,
arrested in the portal radicles, set up inflammatory foci, etc.There
are many examples of hepatic abscess connected with dysenteric
ulcerations of the intestine in which no embolus can be found.Admitting the presence of the embolus originally, its disappearance is
readily understood by reference to the changes induced by suppuration.Excepting these cases there must be many in which no embolus can be
found, because none existed; an unknown septic substance has excited
the suppurative inflammation.Emboli may be lodged in the liver from
thrombi formed in the peripheral distribution of the portal vein, or
from distant parts of the systemic circulation, as in bone diseases.There has been no satisfactory explanation of the manner in which such
emboli pass the pulmonary capillaries to be lodged in the liver.At one
time there was supposed to be a special relation between injuries of
the bones of the head and hepatic abscess, but it is now known {1005}
that these cases are not more numerous than those due to osteo-myelitis
in any situation.Abscesses in the lungs are greatly more frequent than
in the liver in cases of this kind.According to Waldeyer,[90] whilst
in two-thirds of the cases of death from surgical diseases and injuries
there were abscesses in the lungs, in only 6 per cent.were there
abscesses of the liver.It is evident that the emboli entering the
systemic circulation are usually arrested in the pulmonary capillaries.Klebs maintains that such emboli consist of parasitic organisms.[Footnote 87: _On Abscess of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 88: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur Traitement
chirurgical_, par le Dr.S. V. Castro (d'Alexandrie d'Egypte).][Footnote 89: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.[Footnote 90: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xl.Dilatation and ulceration of the bile-ducts were the principal causes
of hepatic abscess, as ascertained by Von Baerensprung, in the Berlin
Pathological Institute.Duodenal catarrh involving the orifice of the
common duct, catarrh of the biliary passages leading to obstruction,
and plugging with a gall-stone have resulted in abscess, the initial
lesion being probably rupture of one or more of the finer tubes or
inflammation leading to suppuration.[91]

[Footnote 91: Grainger Stewart, _The Edinburgh Medical Journal_,
January, 1873.]Finally, a considerable proportion of cases of hepatic abscess arise
under unknown conditions.In such cases, however, it is usually found
that there has been more or less indulgence in alcoholic drinks, or the
liver has been taxed by excesses in the use of rich foods and
condiments, or exposure to extreme degrees of temperature has occurred.In the interior valley of this continent, where hepatic abscess is
comparatively common, the causes are to be found in malarial
influences, in alcoholic indulgence, in dysenteric attacks the product
of climatic variations and improper alimentation, and in the formation
and arrest in transitu of hepatic calculi also the result of
long-continued gastro-duodenal and biliary catarrh.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Great differences of opinion have been expressed
as to the initial lesions in hepatic abscess.It is probable, however,
that these differences are due to the character of the abscess.Some
have their origin in the hepatic cells, others in the connective
tissue, and others still in the vessels.There may be a number of
points at which the suppurative process begins, or it may be limited to
one.Virchow[92] describes the initial lesion as beginning in the
cells, which first become coarsely granular, then opaque, and finally
soften, and pus appears.Klebs, who maintains the constant agency of
septic micrococci, affirms that the changes in the cells are due to
compression exerted by the mass of these organisms distending the
neighboring vessels, and then suppuration begins on the portal side of
the lobules.Liebermeister originally held that the initial lesion is
in the connective tissue; and this view is also supported by Koster,
who brings to bear experimental data.In the walls of the vessels of
the connective tissue and about them, between the hepatic cells, great
numbers of lymphoid cells accumulate.The intercellular spaces are also
distended with plasma and round cells, and in the vicinity of the
central vein the swollen hepatic cells are pressed together; soon
pus-corpuscles appear, and the proper anatomical elements are broken up
into a diffluent mass composed of fat-granules, pus-corpuscles, and
disintegrating hepatic cells.[Footnote 92: _Archiv fur path.When suppurative hepatitis arises from an embolus, or emboli, the
{1006} first step is the change in the appearance of the acini, which
are enlarged and grow softer by disintegration of their cells; then at
the centre a yellowish spot appears, and is made up of the detritus,
granules of fat, and pus.Surrounding such softening portions of the
hepatic tissue is a zone of congestion.When the morbid processes are
excited by emboli, there will be as many centres of pus-formation as
there are particles distributed by the vessels--from two or three to
fifty or more.They may be uniformly distributed through the organ or
be collected in one part.Emboli conveyed by the portal vein will be
arranged with a certain regularity and through the substance of the
liver, whilst those coming from some part of the systemic circulation
tend to form at the periphery under the capsule.Small abscesses in
close proximity unite ultimately by the softening and disintegration of
the intervening tissue.In the so-called tropical abscess, which is the variety so frequently
met with in the interior of this country, the mode of development is
different from the embolic, above described.Owing to the deposit of
some morbific matter whose nature is now unknown, the vessels dilate
and hyperaemia of the part to become the seat of suppuration ensues.The cells become cloudy, granular, and opaque from the deposit of an
albuminous matter in them.Within the area of congestion a yellowish
spot soon appears, surrounded by a translucent, pale-gray ring, and
here suppuration begins; the neighboring cells disintegrate and a
purulent collection is formed, which enlarges by the destruction in
succession of the adjacent portions of hepatic tissue.Whilst this
process is going on there is a border of deep congestion about the
abscess, fading off gradually into the normal tint of the hepatic
parenchyma; the walls of the abscess are rough and irregular from
projections of tissue just beginning to disintegrate, and the pus
burrows in various directions more or less deeply into the softening
parts.The size to which such purulent collections attain is largely
determined by the condition of the liver as a whole.If the organ
attacked is healthy otherwise and the general health is not
deteriorated, the area of the abscess may be limited by a well-defined
membrane and continue inactive for a long time.This limiting membrane
is of inflammatory origin, developed from the connective tissue, and
varies in thickness from a mere line to several.It was formerly called
a pyogenic membrane, because the pus discharged was supposed to be
formed by it.When such a limiting inflammation cannot take place, the
abscess continually enlarges by the softening and destruction of the
adjacent hepatic tissue, and may finally attain to enormous
proportions.The embolic abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to
that of an orange.The so-called tropical abscesses are usually
single--in three-fourths of the cases, according to Rouis;[93] in 62.1
per cent., according to Waring.[94] Of the fatal cases collected by the
latter author, 285 in number, a single abscess existed in 177, and
multiple abscesses in 108.there were two abscesses; in
3.6 per cent., three; and in 5.6 per cent.As regards the part of the liver in which abscess occurs, the
statistics show a great preponderance in favor of the right lobe.In
Waring's collection of 300 cases the right lobe was the {1007} seat of
the abscess in 163, or 67.3 per cent.; the left lobe was affected in
16, or 6.6 per cent.; and both lobes in 35, or 14.4 per cent.The
preponderance of cases affecting the right lobe is the more striking
when it is understood that, other parts being invaded, the right is
included with them in the morbid process.In my own cases the right
lobe was the seat of the abscess in 70 per cent.[Footnote 93: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie_,
_loc.[Footnote 94: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.connected with Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.The contents of the abscesses are affected in character by the form of
the disease, whether embolic or tropical, by its rate of development,
by the condition of the hepatic parenchyma, by the formation of a
limiting membrane, etc.In the more chronic cases, surrounded by a
dense membrane, the pus is usually laudable or dry and cheesy; in the
acute embolic cases the pus is dark brown, ichorous or grumous, and
contains a good deal of detritus of the hepatic parenchyma; and in the
tropical cases it is of a sanguinolent, dark color, or more frequently
of a grayish purulent fluid; and in the acute forms contains much
broken-down tissue, whilst in the chronic cases, in direct ratio to
their duration, the pus approaches the laudable character.The source
of an abscess discharging from the neighborhood of the liver may be
ascertained by a microscopical examination and the discovery of the
hepatic elements (the cells) in the fluid.Bile may also be present in
the pus.The abscesses not confined by a limiting membrane constantly enlarge by
the softening and disintegration of the adjacent liver substance, and
those enclosed or encysted after a period of quiescence of variable
duration begin active efforts to establish communication outwardly.The
point to which a purulent collection in the liver tends becomes an
important element in diagnosis and in treatment.As the abscess
approaches the surface of the liver the capsule inflames, and if
adhesions are not formed more or less sloughing occurs, and the
contents are discharged into the abdominal cavity.Adhesions may form
to the parietes, an external swelling appear, and after a time
discharge take place in the right hypochondrium at some point.Pus may
escape at the umbilicus, in the right inguinal region, posteriorly at
the sacro-iliac junction, and in other situations.Adhesions may form
to the stomach, duodenum, the ascending vena cava, to the diaphragm
opening the thoracic cavity, the pericardium, or the mediastinum; and
the accumulated pus may thus find a vent.According to Waring,[95] the
termination of hepatic abscess is as follows: Of 300 cases, 169, or
56.3 per cent., remained intact--that is, had not advanced beyond the
liver; 48 were evacuated by operation, or 16 per cent.; 14, or 4.6 per
cent., entered the thoracic cavity; 28, or 9.3 per cent., opened into
the right lung; 15, or 5 per cent., entered the abdominal cavity; 7, or
2.3 per cent., opened into the colon; 1 entered the stomach; 3 entered
the hepatic vein near the vena cava; 1 communicated with the hepatic
ducts, 2 with the right kidney, etc.The termination of 162 fatal
cases, according to Rouis,[96] was as follows: 125 proved fatal in
consequence of the extent of the abscess or of the severity of the
accompanying dysentery; 3 terminated by gangrene of the walls of the
abscess; 3 by peritonitis; 12 by opening of the abscess; 2 by rupture
of adhesions; 11 by opening of the abscess into the pleura; 2 by
intercurrent and 3 by secondary pneumonia.Notwithstanding the
differences {1008} in the mode of expressing the conditions, the
general results are the same.[Footnote 95: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.of
Abscess in the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 96: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques, etc._, p.An abscess of the liver having discharged in a favorable way, healing
may take place.There may be such an extent of injury--the whole
secreting structure of the liver being destroyed--that repair is beyond
the power of the organism.The best results are attained when discharge
occurs by the most direct route externally; the next, by way of the
right lung; the third, by the stomach or intestine.Repair cannot be
hoped for when a large part of the normal hepatic structure is
destroyed.When the pus escapes the walls of the abscess approximate,
and union takes place by connective tissue, leaving a radiated or a
merely linear cicatrix to mark the site of the purulent collection.So
perfectly does repair take place in suitable subjects that no trace of
the lesion may remain.Those portions of the liver outside the borders of the abscess, and
beyond the vascular derangements produced by it, may be entirely
healthy.In the cases terminating in recovery the portion of the liver
unaffected by abscess continues to functionate normally.More or less
of the liver may be destroyed; hence it follows that recovery may be
partial.According to the damage done to the proper secreting structure
of the organ will the recovery be partial, limited, or complete.SYMPTOMS.--The existence of an abscess of the liver is determined by
systemic or general and by local symptoms, and they may be acute or
chronic.Systemic.--In acute cases the beginning of mischief may be announced by
a rigor, but more frequently this indicates the onset of suppuration,
and is one of the phenomena of the chronic form.As the disease occurs
in this country, a chill takes place suddenly in a case which presents
the usual symptoms of proctitis (dysentery) during the course of this
affection or soon after its apparent cure; then a febrile movement
occurs, and subsequently an irregular intermittent, the rise of
temperature being preceded by rigors or mere transient chilliness.With
these febrile symptoms there may be associated uneasiness in the right
hypochondrium, acute pain, or a feeling of weight and pressure, with
jaundice, etc.The fever is septicaemic, intermittent, or remittent if
it have any special type.In the septicaemic form the rigors are
severe, occur irregularly, sometimes daily, sometimes twice a day, and
at intervals of two or three days or longer; the fever rises to a high
point--104 degrees, 105 degrees, or higher--and the sweats are profuse.In the intermittent form the fever usually has the quotidian type; some
slight chilliness is experienced in the early morning as a rule, and
the exacerbation occurs in the afternoon and evening, the sweating
being slight toward the morning.More frequently, in the writer's
observation, the type of fever has been remittent, with periodical, but
not regularly so, exacerbations.In such cases the morning temperature
has been at 99 degrees or 100 degrees, and the evening 102 degrees or
103 degrees.Such a range of temperature may be present during three or
four weeks or even longer, the abscess gradually making its way
outwardly.Conclusions may be drawn from the behavior of the febrile
movement as to the character of the local affection, with the
limitations imposed by the necessary uncertainty of the data.If the
chills are decided rigors, the fever {1009} high, and the sweats
profuse, either pyaemic abscesses or large tropical abscesses
implicating neighboring organs exist.The simple intermittent,
especially the remittent, form of fever suggests abscesses of medium
size making their way outwardly, with only partial injury to the parts
traversed.In a certain portion of the cases the type of fever changes
when a large accumulation of pus takes place; after several weeks of a
mild remittent the fever becomes irregularly intermittent with rigors,
strong exacerbations, and profuse sweats.In protracted cases the fever
assumes the typhoid aspect; there is profound adynamia, dry tongue,
sordes, diarrhoea, and the usual symptoms of this state.When the
secreting structure of the liver is destroyed to a large extent, the
condition of acholia is superadded to the typhoid state.The pulse is irritable and quick from the beginning of the symptoms.In
a few instances a slow pulse, such as occurs in jaundice, has been
observed, but generally the number of cardiac contractions is in a
direct ratio with the body temperature.When typhoid symptoms supervene
in advanced cases the pulse becomes weak and dicrotic.The chronic cases with
mild remittent fever have little more than slight moisture of the
surface, whilst the acute and pyaemic cases are characterized by
profuse sweats.If to an irregular febrile movement, preceded by chills
and followed by sweats, there is added the tendency to sweat on all
occasions--on slight exertion, on sleeping, under any
excitement--suppuration may be suspected.General malaise, a sense of fatigue and exhaustion, and progressive
decline in flesh and strength occur.It is remarkable, however, how
some obese subjects preserve their roundness and apparent fulness of
habit.Usually, however, emaciation advances pari passu with the
progress of the suppuration.The more acute the symptoms, the more
rapid the wasting.When an encysted abscess develops in the course of a
chronic dysentery, there may be no appreciable change in the condition
of the patient properly attributable to the additional lesion.The loss
of appetite, the frequent vomiting, and often the dysenteric troubles,
contribute materially to the exhaustion and the wasting of the tissues.The stomachal derangements may be present with the initial symptoms,
but they are usually more pronounced when the abscess attains to
considerable size.A peculiar tint of the skin, especially of the face, is observed in
those cases without jaundice.There is an earthy or sallow hue, which
to the practised eye signifies suppuration.Jaundice is present in a
less proportion of cases.In 13 of Waring's cases the skin is said to
be sallow.In Rouis's collection icterus was present in 17 per cent.,
or 26 times in 155 patients.According to Waring, jaundice is rarely
present.In the 12 cases in my own hands actual jaundice was not
present in one, but 9 had an earthy hue or presented some yellowness of
the conjunctiva.In fact, jaundice does not have the importance as a
symptom which might, a priori, have been expected.The mental condition of these subjects is that of depression.They
sleep poorly, are disturbed by vivid dreams of a horrifying character,
and the nocturnal sweats increase the tendency to wakefulness.Hypochondria, or at least marked symptoms of mental depression, as
{1010} Hammond[97] has shown, are present in many cases.So frequent,
indeed, seems to be the association of a depressed mental state with
hepatic abscess that in every case of the former the liver should be
carefully explored.Hammond goes so far as to say that in every case of
hypochondriasis puncture of the liver with the aspirator needle should
be practised when any symptom, however indefinite, indicates the
existence of an abscess.Besides the condition of hypochondriasis in
many cases, there may be stupor, hebetude of mind, confusion due to
acholia, cholaemia (Flint's cholesteraemia), when a large part of the
liver structure is destroyed.[Footnote 97: _Neurological Contributions_, vol.68: "On
Obscure Abscesses of the Liver, their association with Hypochondria and
other Forms of Mental Derangement, and their Treatment."]Sweating has already been referred to as a phenomenon connected with
the febrile movement.It is necessary to state further that this may
vary in amount from a mere moisture of the surface connected with
sleep, or it may be a profuse diaphoresis with which the febrile
paroxysm terminates.As a systemic symptom, sweating is strongly
suggestive of suppuration, and may therefore be extremely significant,
in this connection, of suppuration in the liver.According to Waring,
of 75 cases specifically interrogated on this point, 72 presented this
symptom.123) to it as very constantly present, coming
on chiefly at night--sometimes generally over the body, sometimes
limited to the head, and always accompanied by an accelerated pulse.The urine in cases of hepatic abscess varies; it is never normal.There
may be merely an excess of urates--a symptom common enough in all
febrile affections and in suppuration.It is usually high-,
deficient in urea, and contains leucin and tyrosin, and not often
bile-pigment, except when jaundice is present, which, as we have seen,
is rather uncommon.It should be borne in mind that whilst the above-described mental and
cerebral and other symptoms are often present, they are by no means
invariably so.There are cases, usually of encysted abscess, in which
no functional disturbance of any kind exists.But the systemic symptoms
are by no means so important as the local.To these we must now direct
attention.Local.--The position, size, and shape of the liver are not without
significance, but it is strictly correct to say that an abscess of the
liver may exist without any change in the size of the organ or in its
relations to the surrounding organs.In 2 of 12 cases in the hands of
the writer there was no evidence of enlargement of the right
hypochondrium, but a difference in circumference of half an inch was
ascertained in favor of the left side.In 4 cases there was no
appreciable change in the size of the hepatic region; in one-half there
was an increase in the area of hepatic dulness.In one of the cases in
which the left side was the larger the abscess was of enormous extent,
and discharged by the stomach and intestine.The enlargement of the
liver may be very great.In one instance observed by the author the
abscess reached to the upper border of the third rib.Rarely does the
dulness extend more than two fingers' breadth below the inferior margin
of the ribs, although cases are reported in which the enlarged organ
reached to the crest of the ileum.As a rule, the diaphragm is pushed
up and the lung displaced, rather than the dulness is extended
downward.When the first tumefaction {1011} due to the initial
congestion takes place, the organ may be much larger than subsequently,
the pus becoming encysted and the normal state outside of the area of
suppuration being restored.The purulent collection in a large
proportion of the cases taking place in the right lobe, the extension
of dulness is in the same lines as the normal.When, however, the right
lobe is the seat of abscess, or a purulent collection forms around an
impacted calculus, the swelling may appear in the outer border of the
epigastrium next the ribs, and the increased area of dulness will be
across the epigastrium and occupying the superior portion of this
region.The general experience on these points corresponds to my own.Thus, according to Waring, there was an evident enlargement of the
liver in 90 cases, and no enlargement in 11.In most cases the increase
in size gives the impression of a fulness or hardness of the liver or
of a diffused swelling or tumor of the epigastrium.In some instances
the right hypochondrium is bulged out, the intercostal spaces widened,
and the side appears to be or is actually elevated, and occasionally
enlarged veins form, as in cases of the obstructed portal circulation
of cirrhosis.In a case recently presented at Jefferson College
Hospital clinic by the author, a globular swelling formed in the walls
of the abdomen just below the inferior margin of the ribs near the site
of the gall-bladder, and was held by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of this locality; but it had the history of an hepatic abscess, and
ultimately proved to be one.Rouis furnishes statistical evidence of
the time when the increase in size of the liver occurs with respect to
the other symptoms.He has noted an enlargement of the organ 73 times
in 122 cases.Of 51 cases, the liver was enlarged in 12 before
suppuration, in 22 at the onset of suppuration, and in 17 after
suppuration was established.In 49 examples the liver was enlarged in 2
before any other symptom was manifest, in 8 at the onset of symptoms,
and in 39 after the symptoms were well declared.Fluctuation is not referred to by the writers in general, and there are
no statistical data on this symptom, so far as our observation extends.No symptom could be more uncertain in all doubtful cases.When a large
accumulation has taken place and the parietes of the sac are thin,
fluctuation may be detected, but it cannot then be regarded as
decisive.When an abscess in the interior of the right lobe is
encysted, no fluctuation can be effected.The best mode of eliciting
fluctuation, according to Hammond, is to place the extremities of the
fingers of the left hand in the depression between the ribs over the
most prominent part of the right hypochondrium, and gently tap with the
fingers of the right hand the right border of the epigastrium.In 3 out
of 12 cases this method has apparently elicited fluctuation in my own
experience.The elasticity of the hepatic structure is such that the
method of palpation, however practised, must return a sensation nearly
allied to that of fluctuation in a purulent accumulation.It is
certain, therefore, that errors of observation are liable to occur, and
hence conclusions based on an apparent fluctuation should be accepted
with caution; under any circumstances it should be very distinct, and
even then should not be acted on unless supported by other suggestive
evidence.The uneasiness or pain felt in the right hypochondrium varies greatly
according to the position of the abscess, the degree and kind of
pressure exerted on neighboring organs, and the period of its
development.When {1012} the peritoneal layer of the liver is involved,
there will usually be acute pain, and this happens at two periods--when
the abscess first forms from an impacted calculus or from any cause
which includes the peritoneum, and subsequently when the pus, making
its way from the liver, excites inflammation in the peritoneal
investment of the liver, of the diaphragm, or affects ultimately the
pleural membrane.In the so-called pyaemic abscesses there is very
little pain, and in the case of the large single abscess in the
interior of the right lobe there is rather a sensation of weight or of
heaviness, of dragging than of acute pain.When the capsule of the
liver is put on the stretch or the peritoneal investment is inflamed,
then acute pain may be felt.More or less pain or local distress is, on
the whole, a usual symptom.According to Rouis,[98] local pain is
present in 141 out of 177 cases, or in 85 per cent.The statistics of
Waring[99] closely correspond, for of 173 patients affected with this
malady, in 153 there was more or less pain referable to the affected
organ.The position of the pain has some influence in determining the
seat of the malady, and often indicates the position of the abscess.As
respects the character of the pain, there is little uniformity; in
general it is a tensive, heavy, throbbing sensation, but under the
circumstances above mentioned this may have an acute or lancinating
character, as when the capsule or the peritoneal investment of the
organ becomes involved.[Footnote 98: _Recherches, etc._, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 99: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

Besides the pain directly referable to the liver there are painful
sensations felt in the neighboring parts, of very considerable
significance.These are often described as sympathetic pains, and are
referred to the shoulder--to the right shoulder when the right lobe is
the seat of mischief, and to the left shoulder when the abscess forms
in the left lobe of the liver.Although this statement has many
limitations, it is not without diagnostic importance.Rouis ascertained
the existence of the shoulder pain in 17 per cent.of the cases, or in
28 in a total of 163.Waring reports that this symptom was observed in
52 in a total of 76 cases.The right shoulder seems to be affected in
about the same ratio as the right lobe of the liver in 25 times out of
26 cases, according to Rouis.The shoulder pain appears at the same
time, in a majority of cases, as the hepatic pain, but it is very
capricious.It is most frequently at the top of the shoulder, but it
may be at the end of the clavicle, in the scapula, or extend down the
arm.Its duration is very irregular, appearing occasionally during the
existence of the disease, coming on at the outset, and lasting weeks or
months, or only felt on pressure over the liver, on coughing, or on
taking a full inspiration.The character of the pain is equally
uncertain.It is usually heavy, tensive, stinging, or may be merely a
sensation of soreness or of uneasiness or of weariness.The behavior of
the shoulder pain is partly explicable by reference to the path by
which the reflex is conveyed.As Luschka[100] has shown, the filaments
of the phrenic nerve supplied to the suspensory ligament and capsule of
the liver, put on the stretch or irritated, convey the impression to
the cord, and it is reflected over the sensory fibres of the fourth
cervical distributed to the shoulder.Rouis reports an instance in
which the deltoid was wasted.[Footnote 100: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

The decubitus of patients affected with hepatic abscess is often {1013}
extremely characteristic.To obviate the pressure on the swollen and
inflamed organ the position assumed is right lateral-dorsal, the body
inclined to the right, the right thigh flexed on the pelvis, and the
spinal column so curved as to relax the abdominal muscles of the right
side.When the pain and tenderness are not great there may be frequent
changes of position, but in repose the lateral-dorsal decubitus is
assumed.When the suppuration is well advanced and the accumulation
large, the patient keeps in that position nearly constantly.If
pressure interferes with the normal play of the lungs, and dyspnoea is
produced on assuming the recumbent posture, the attitude taken
expresses this state also: then the decubitus is lateral and partly
dorsal, but the body is raised to a half-upright.There are many
exceptions to these rules.Some lie easiest on the back, some on the
left side; but it is quite certain that much the largest number, when
uninfluenced by special circumstances, naturally place themselves as
above described.Jaundice is amongst the rarer symptoms.Rouis finds it to be present in
17 per cent.of the cases, Thierfelder in 16 per cent., and Waring in
somewhat less than 6 per cent.Referring to my own observation,
jaundice has rarely been present, but some yellowness of the
conjunctivae and a faint yellow tint of the skin generally have been
evident.The peculiar aspect of the countenance connected with
suppuration has rarely been wanting.When jaundice does occur, it is
referable to two conditions--to a catarrhal swelling of the bile-ducts,
which may be coincident with the onset of the suppurative inflammation;
to the pressure of the abscess on the hepatic or common duct, which
must happen at a late period.As an abscess of the liver forms and enlarges, pressure is exerted on
neighboring organs, producing very decided disturbances.Nausea and
vomiting, anorexia, a coated or glazed tongue, diarrhoea or dysentery,
are amongst the disorders of this kind involving the digestive
apparatus.There is nothing characteristic in the condition of the tongue which
does not belong to suppuration in any situation.Nevertheless, there
are some appearances that have a certain value in conjunction with
other diagnostic signs.At the onset of the suppurative inflammation
the tongue is more or less heavily coated, but as the case proceeds it
becomes dry and glazed in parts, whilst covered with a well-defined
membrane-like crust at the base and margins.This appearance is very
characteristic of the cases of suppuration, the abscess enlarging.In a
very important case observed by me lately there was a well-marked
diphtheritic-like exudation of the tongue and fauces toward the
termination of the case, the membrane forming as the pus accumulated.This appearance was coincident with a typhoid state.Nausea and vomiting appear with the beginning of symptoms, are
associated with the general signs of systemic disturbance, and are
especially prominent when an accumulation of pus takes place, being due
under these circumstances to pressure on the hepatic and solar plexuses
or to direct encroachment on the stomach--probably to both causes.The
frequency and persistence of the vomiting are points of much diagnostic
importance, according to Maclean[101] and Fayrer,[102] which I {1014}
am able to fully confirm from my own experience.The matters ejected by
vomiting consist of the contents of the stomach--glairy mucus, the
accumulation in the gall-bladder, altered blood (coffee-grounds)--and
the contents of the abscess if it discharge by the stomach.The
vomiting is most apt to occur during the febrile exacerbation or at the
time of sweating.The statistics are conclusive as to the frequency of
vomiting as a symptom.Of 84 cases in which special reference was made
to this point, in 74 nausea or vomiting existed.In my own experience
this symptom has never been wanting.[Footnote 101: "The Diagnostic Value of Uncontrollable Vomiting," by W.
C. Maclean, _Brit.Journ._, August 1, 1873.][Footnote 102: _Ibid._, September 26, 1873.]The relation between abscess of the liver and dysentery has been much
discussed.Under the head of Causes the influence of dysentery as a
pathogenetic factor has already been examined.We have now to study its
symptomatic relations.A considerable proportion of the cases occurring
in this country have been preceded by proctitis--simple, sporadic
dysentery affecting the rectum.In India a close relationship has been
traced between ulcerations of the intestinal canal and abscess.of the cases have occurred in those
who were actually suffering from dysentery or recent or old
ulcerations.As observed by Rouis in Algiers, out of 143 cases there
were 128 with dysentery, or 90 per cent.Budd[103] long ago maintained
that a peculiar poison generated at an open ulceration in the intestine
was the true cause.Moxon,[104] Dickinson, and others have lately
reaffirmed this explanation.A case by the latter[105] casts a strong
light on this question: A patient had extensive dysenteric ulceration
of the intestine and an abscess of the liver, without any symptoms
indicating their existence.Such a case teaches the instructive lesson
that dysenteric ulcerations may escape detection, and hence the
connection between abscess and the intestinal lesion remains unknown.In a small proportion of cases--about 5 per cent.--dysentery is a
result, apparently, of hepatic abscess.Whether the relation is
admitted to exist or not, it is a curious fact that in so many cases
ulcerative disease of the intestinal canal accompanies the hepatic
affection.Hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, gastro-intestinal
catarrh, etc.are produced by the pressure of an enlarging abscess on
the portal vein.[Footnote 103: _Diseases of the Liver_, 3d ed., p.[Footnote 104: _Pathological Transactions_, 1862 and subsequently.Numerous cases are recorded in the various volumes up to 1880.][Footnote 105: _Ibid._, vol.The urine contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, is usually
loaded with urates, and the amount of urea may be deficient when much
of the hepatic tissue is destroyed.From the beginning of symptoms some cough is experienced: it is short
and dry, but after a time in many cases the cough is catching and
painful, and finally may be accompanied by profuse purulent
expectoration.The breathing is short and catching when by the upward
extension of the mischief the diaphragm is encroached on, and may
become very painful when the pleura is inflamed.Ulceration of an
abscess into the lungs is announced by the signs of a local
pleuro-pneumonia--by the catching inspiration, the friction sound, the
crepitant rale, the bronchophony and bronchial breathing, and bloody
sputa usually, etc.Some time before the abscess really reaches the
diaphragm, preparation is made in the lung for the discharge through a
bronchus.The author has seen {1015} many examples of this, and a very
striking illustration of the same fact is afforded in a case by
Dickinson,[106] in which an abscess holding about four ounces was
contained in the upper part of the right lobe; its walls were irregular
and not lined by a limiting membrane.It is further stated that the
"right pleura was coated with flocculent lymph, and the cavity
contained serous fluid," etc.Here, in advance of the abscess,
preparation was made for its discharge through the lung.The tendency
of an abscess of the abdomen to external discharge is manifested in two
directions: those of the upper part tend to discharge through the
lungs, those of the lower part through the natural openings below.Abscesses of the liver come within the former rule, but it is not of
invariable application, since some discharge by the stomach or
intestine, some externally; yet a large proportion make their way
through the lungs.Another symptom referable to the pulmonary organs in
cases of hepatic abscess is singultus, or hiccough.This is a symptom
of the period of discharge rather, and is often extremely protracted
and exhausting.Pericarditis occurs in those cases in which discharge
takes place in this direction, and it may develop, as does pleuritis,
in advance of any change in the diaphragm.This preparation of the
thoracic organs for external discharge seems almost like a conscious
purpose, as if an intelligent supervision of these processes were
exercised.[Footnote 106: _Transactions of the Pathological Society_, vol.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As the facts already given have
sufficiently shown, the course of abscess of the liver is extremely
uncertain.From the beginning to the end there may not be a single
indication of its presence.On the other hand, a well-marked case is
perfectly characteristic.Abscesses of the liver are acute and
chronic--the former of short duration, accompanying pyaemia, portal
phlebitis, and similar conditions; the latter, arising in the course of
chronic dysentery or from unknown causes, especially if encysted,
remaining latent for weeks or months.The course of an abscess is much
influenced by the direction taken by the pus in the attempt at
discharge.This portion of the subject requires careful statement and
thorough treatment, and we therefore present it somewhat in detail.Beginning with his individual observations, the abscess in the author's
12 cases discharged--3 externally, 5 by the lungs, and 4 by the stomach
or intestines.In Waring's[107] collection of 300 fatal cases, 169
remained intact at death, 48 were operated on; consequently, only 83
are left for the purpose of this comparison.Of 83 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging spontaneously in some direction, 42 escaped into
the thoracic cavity or by the right lung (in 28); into the abdominal
cavity (15) or stomach (1) or intestine (7), 23; externally 2, besides
in special directions to be hereafter referred to.Rouis[108] has
tabulated the results in 30 cases of abscess fatal without an operative
influence.Of these, 2 discharged externally, 17 by the thorax (15 by
the lung), 5 by the stomach, 4 by the intestine, and 2 by the biliary
canals.[Footnote 107: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.[Footnote 108: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie,
etc._, _loc.The appearances presented when the discharge takes place through the
external parts are by no means uniform.When the epigastric or
umbilical region is the point of discharge, a globular tumor forms,
which may {1016} be mistaken for a fibroid or fatty growth; softening
in the centre of the mass occurs, and ultimately the pus is discharged.If the pus makes its way outwardly through the right hypochondrium, the
tumor formed is furrowed by the attachment to the ribs, and several
openings usually occur.The pus may burrow under the skin for some
distance and point in the axilla, or, making its way along the
suspensory ligament, emerge at the navel, or, descending, appear in the
lumbar region or under Poupart's ligament.As the statistics prove, the most usual route for discharge to take
place is by the thoracic cavity, especially the right lung.Some time
in advance of an opening in the diaphragm a localized pleuro-pneumonia
occurs, adhesions form between the pulmonary and costal pleura, and a
channel is tunnelled out for the passage of the pus to a bronchus.The
discharge of pus suddenly occurs after some days of cough and bloody
expectoration.Even in favorable cases the amount is so large that the
patient has extreme difficulty in disposing of it, and in unfavorable
cases, the quantity being large, the patient's life is ended by apnoea.In still other cases an extensive purulent accumulation may form in the
pleural cavity, the lung is compressed, and all the phenomena of an
empyema superadded to those of a hepatic abscess.In a case reported by
Westphalen[109] all the bile secreted by the patient came out by an
opening in the fifth intercostal space.The empyema thus induced may
indeed be the principal lesion, as in the case of the late Gen.Breckenridge, on whom thoracentesis was performed by Sayre of New York,
and in a case reported by Lower.[110] So far from this being uncommon,
as asserted by Thierfelder, when an abscess of the liver approaches the
diaphragm inflammatory symptoms begin on the pleural side, and thus
pyothorax may occur in advance of the perforation of this septum.[Footnote 109: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.Med._, 1873, Band xi.[Footnote 110: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1864, p.The opening of an hepatic abscess into the pericardium is rare, since
in Waring's collection of 300 fatal cases there was not one.When it
does occur, pain is experienced about the heart; the action of the
organ becomes irregular; praecordial anxiety and oppression are felt;
suffocative attacks occur; and very soon the symptoms of pericarditis
arise.Perforation of the ascending vena cava or of the hepatic vein
happens in about 2 per cent.When a quantity of pus is
thus turned into the circulation, disastrous results follow, not so
much from the infective nature of the pus as from the sudden increased
pressure within the vascular system and the labor imposed on the heart,
already failing.The escape of the pus into the peritoneal cavity occurs in about 11 per
cent.of the cases of spontaneous evacuation, according to Waring.Of
the 162 fatal cases collected by Rouis, 14 opened into the
peritoneum--about the same proportion as Waring gives.When discharge
takes place into the peritoneum, the patient passes into a condition of
collapse, or peritonitis is excited and rapidly proves fatal.In rare
instances the inflammatory reaction is restricted to a small area,
ulceration takes place through the abdominal parietes, and thus
discharge is effected.An opening may be made into the intestine or into the pelvis of the
kidney.In the former case pus is discharged by stool or by vomit, and
often in enormous quantity; in the latter by the urine, frequent and
{1017} painful micturition, with much pus, being the evidence of the
accident.In either case communication may be kept up with the abscess,
and the patient be worn out with the exhausting discharge maintained by
the intercommunication between the abscess and the canal through which
discharge takes place.Cases of hepatic abscess prove fatal without perforation.In Waring's
collection of 300 cases, 169 remained intact, in the words of the
author--that is, did not extend beyond the boundaries of the liver.Of
203 cases collected by Rouis, 96 did not extend beyond the liver.According to Thierfelder, about one-half of the cases of hepatic
abscess perforate the liver.These statistics therefore closely
correspond, and the general conclusion is very nearly expressed in the
formulated statement of Thierfelder.The duration of hepatic abscess cannot readily be expressed in figures.The acute cases terminate early by reason of the various complicating
conditions.The chronic cases are much influenced in their duration by
the presence of a limiting membrane, for if this be formed the duration
will be protracted over weeks or months; and those cases not thus
confined are necessarily of shorter duration.A period of latency may
result when the extension of the morbid process is thus hindered.Forming a conclusion from the general conduct of the cases, it may be
said that the duration of hepatic abscess is from two weeks to six
months.Of 220 cases collected by Waring, the average duration was 39
days.Rouis fixes the average duration in 179 cases at 60 days.Of
Waring's cases, the largest number (59) terminated in from 10 to 20
days; whilst Rouis places the maximum number (104) at from 11 to 60
days, the shortest duration of any case being 10 days, and the longest
480 days.The termination may be accelerated by the manner of discharge, as when
the abscess opens into the ascending vena cava, into the sac of the
pericardium, or into the peritoneal cavity.In my own cases, carefully
selected for these observations, death occurred in one during discharge
by the right lung, one within twelve hours after discharge by the
intestine, and one within ten days after discharge by the stomach and
intestine, the mortality of the whole being 75 per cent.In Waring's
collection of 300 fatal cases, 169 died whilst the abscess was still
intact--that is, in the liver.The mortality from abscess of the liver is very large.In Rouis's
collection of 203 cases, 162 died, 39 recovered entirely, and 2
improved; 80 per cent., therefore, proved fatal.According to De
Castro,[111] whose observations were made at Alexandria, Egypt, 93 in
208 cases died, this being 72.5 per cent.According to Ramirez,[112] of
11 cases of which an account is given in his memoir, 10 died and 1
recovered--a mortality of 90 per cent.40) also gives the
results arrived at by the Medico-chirurgical Society of Alexandria, who
collected 72 cases of abscess, of which 58 died, making the percentage
of deaths 80.5.Various circumstances besides the abscess affect the
result.An early successful operation, the mode of discharge, the
amount of hepatic tissue destroyed by the {1018} suppuration, the
extent of pre-existing lesions--especially ulcerations of the
intestinal canal--are important factors in the result.In respect to
some of these we have valuable statistical data.The discharge through
the lungs is the most favorable route, next by the parietes of the
abdomen, and lastly by the intestinal canal.One-half of those cases in
which discharge is effected by the right lung get well.This is my own
experience, and it accords with the observations of Rouis, of De
Castro, and others.Rouis gives the result in 30 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging by the right lung; of these 15 recovered.Of 25
cases observed by De Castro, discharging by the lungs, 19 recovered.Next to the discharge by the bronchi, the most favorable mode of exit
is externally, through the parietes of the abdomen; much less favorable
is by the stomach or intestine; but still more fatal is the discharge
into the cavity of the peritoneum.When the abscesses are multiple and
due to pyaemia, the termination is always in death.The numerous
lesions besides the hepatic accelerate the fatal issue.In the case of
large single abscesses the result is in a great measure due to
exhaustion from protracted suppuration.When in addition to the
formation of a great quantity of pus there is frequent vomiting and
rejection of aliment, the failure of strength is proportionally rapid.In favorable cases, after an abscess is evacuated through the right
lung, recovery takes place promptly.When the discharge occurs through
the abdominal wall, the process is much slower, and often fistulous
passages with several orifices, very slow to heal, are formed.Complete
recovery may ultimately take place.The recovery will be incomplete in
those cases with large loss of hepatic substance, especially when this
coincides, as it usually does, with catarrh, ulceration, and other
lesions of the intestinal tube.Again, the recovery will be incomplete
in those cases where there are imperfect healing of the abscess site
and a fistulous communication with the exterior.[Footnote 111: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, _loc.[Footnote 112: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
receuilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, _loc.cit._]

It is possible for the arrest and healing of a suppurative inflammation
of the liver to take place without discharge.Under such circumstances
the watery part of the pus is absorbed, the solid constituents undergo
a fatty metamorphosis, are emulsionized, and thus absorbed, and
gradually closure of the damaged area is effected by a
connective-tissue formation.We must, however, accept with caution
those examples of this process which are supposed to have occurred
because radiating cicatrices are discovered on the surface of the
liver.In a case of hepatic abscess discharging through the lung, known
to the writer, after death, which occurred fifteen years subsequently,
there was no trace of the mischief, so perfectly had repair been
effected.Radiating cicatrices are so often of syphilitic origin that
they cannot be accepted as proof of the former existence of an abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--He who finds the diagnosis of abscess of the liver easy
under all circumstances can have had but little experience with the
numerous difficulties in the way of a correct opinion.There are cases
so plain that the most casual inspection suffices to form a conclusion;
there are cases so difficult that the most elaborate study fails to
unravel the mystery.The maladies with which hepatic abscess may be
confounded are echinococcus of the liver, dropsy of the gall-bladder,
cancer, abscess of the abdominal wall, empyema, or hydrothorax, etc.As
regards echinococcus, the difference consists in the slow and painless
enlargement characteristic of echinococcus, and the absence of any
symptoms other than those {1019} due to the mere pressure of the
enlarging mass.In abscess there may be no apparent enlargement, or the
increase in the area of dulness may be very great, or after a period of
increase of size there may be contraction due to the formation of pus,
and hence limitation of the inflammation; finally, the accumulation of
fluid may be sufficient to cause dulness up to the inferior margin of
the second rib.There are no corresponding changes of size in the
echinococcus cyst.Furthermore, abscess of the liver large enough to be
recognized by the increased dimensions of the organ will be accompanied
by more or less pain in the right hypochondrium and by a septicaemic
fever.On the other hand, an echinococcus tumor is not accompanied by
fever, pain, or tenderness, and it has that peculiar elastic trembling
known as the purring tremor.The most certain means of differential
diagnosis is the use of an aspiration-needle and the withdrawal of a
portion of the fluid.The presence of pus with hepatic cells will be
conclusive of abscess, whilst a serous fluid with echinococci hooklets
will prove the existence of the echinococcus cyst.In cases of dropsy of the gall-bladder there are no febrile symptoms,
no chills, and the tenderness when present is limited to the pyriform
body, the seat of the accumulation of fluid, and no general enlargement
of the liver can be made out.At the point of swelling fluctuation may
be detected, or if the gall-bladder is filled with calculi the
sensation imparted to the touch is that of a hard, nodular body of an
area and position corresponding to that of the gall-bladder.Tapping
the gall-bladder, an easy and safe procedure, will resolve all doubts.When an impaction of a gall-stone is the cause of abscess, the clinical
history is eminently characteristic: there are attacks of hepatic
colic, after one of which the chills, fever, and sweats belonging to
hepatic abscess occur.The differentiation of cancer of the liver from abscess rests on the
following considerations: In cancer there is slow enlargement, with
pain; a more or less nodular state of the organ without fluctuation;
usually ascites; no rigors; no fever and sweats.In abscess the liver
may or may not be enlarged; there are rigors, fever, and sweating, and
the surface of the organ, so far as it can be reached, is smooth and
elastic, and it may be fluctuating.Cancer happens in persons after
middle life, develops very slowly, and is accompanied by a peculiar
cachexia; abscess occurs at any period, very often succeeds to or is
accompanied by dysentery and by the usual phenomena of suppuration.It is extremely difficult to separate an abscess in the abdominal wall,
in the right hypochondrium, or a tumor in this region, from an abscess
of the liver.The history of the case, the existence of a dysentery or
of an apparent intermittent or remittent fever before the appearance of
a purulent collection, will indicate the liver as the probable source
of the trouble.Attention has already been called to a case in which an
abscess of the liver was supposed by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of the abdominal wall.The history in this case of an obstinate
remittent fever, followed by the appearance of a tumor of the
hypochondrium and by a preliminary discharge at the umbilicus, clearly
indicated the nature of the trouble.In the absence of any history of
the case it is extremely difficult to fix the origin of a suppurating
tumor originating, apparently, in the depth of the right hypochondrium.Mistakes are frequently made in the case of an abscess developing in
{1020} the convexity of the right lobe of the liver and pushing the
diaphragm up to the third, even to the second, rib, and thus producing
conditions identical with empyema of the right thorax.Such instances
of hepatic abscess are peculiarly difficult of recognition, because,
the physical signs being the same as those of empyema, the
differentiation must rest on the clinical history.In cases of empyema
proper the effusion in the chest is preceded by pain and accompanied by
an increasing difficulty of breathing; in hepatic abscess there are, as
a rule, symptoms of disturbance in the hepatic functions, fluctuation
in the hepatic region, dysentery, etc., long anterior to any
disturbance in the thoracic organs.Again, empyema may be a latent
affection, without any symptom except some obscure pain and a
progressive increase in the difficulty of breathing; on the other hand,
abscess of the liver is preceded by symptoms of liver disease and of
associated maladies.A dry, purposeless cough is present in many cases
of abscess; a painful cough with bloody expectoration occurs when
preparation is making for discharge through the lungs.Errors of diagnosis are liable to occur in the consideration of
symptoms unquestionably hepatic in origin.Thus, the intermittent fever
accompanying some cases of hepatic colic, like the shivering fits and
fever which occur in cases of nephro-lithiasis, may be confounded with
the septicaemic fever of hepatic abscess.An attentive examination of
the attendant circumstances, especially a careful survey of the right
hypochondrium, can alone determine the nature of the symptoms.In all
doubtful cases the experimentum crucis of puncture with the
exploring-needle becomes a measure of necessity.When all diagnostic
indications are at fault, the needle of the aspirator may decide the
issue.An abundant experience has shown that a needle of suitable size
may be introduced into the right lobe without any ill result--often,
indeed, with distinctly good effects when there is no suppuration or
when pus cannot be detected.In the present state of our knowledge it
cannot be determined why puncture of the organ should be beneficial in
cases having the symptomatic type of hepatic abscess when none exists;
but of this fact there is no doubt.TREATMENT.--As the formation of pus is coincident with or causative of
the first symptoms, it is obvious that treatment directed to prevent an
abscess can rarely succeed.Yet it is probable that now and then an
abscess just forming has been arrested and healing effected.At the
onset of symptoms some large doses of quinine, with a little morphine
(scruple j of the former and 1/8 gr.of the latter), every four or six
hours, may have a decided curative effect.During the course of the
septicaemic fever, with its chills and febrile exacerbations, quinine
in full doses and alcohol according to the conditions present are
necessary remedies.As the symptoms develop saline laxatives are useful
until the formation of pus becomes evident, when all perturbating
treatment of the intestinal canal should cease.If dysentery be present
when the hepatic symptoms arise, it should be cured as promptly as
possible; and of all remedies for this purpose, ipecac given in the
usual antidysenteric quantity offers the best prospect of relief.For
the dysentery which succeeds to abscess, and is probably, in part at
least, dependent on portal obstruction, the mineral astringents, as
copper sulphate, are the most effective remedies.As far as
practicable, after an abscess has formed the intestinal canal should be
kept quiet, for any considerable disturbance will {1021} endanger the
escape of pus into the peritoneal cavity.Persistent vomiting is very
significant of pressure by an enlarging abscess in the stomach, and
usually signifies an abscess associated with impacted calculus.It is
important in such cases to maintain, as far as can be done, a quiescent
condition of the stomach, for the purpose of preventing rupture into
the peritoneal cavity and to favor the nutrition which is seriously
endangered by the repeated vomiting.Effervescent soda powders are very
useful; carbolic acid in solution, or creasote-water with or without
bismuth, is beneficial; champagne, very dry and highly effervescent,
has been, in the writer's hands, remarkably efficient.As food becomes
a most important need in such cases, milk and lime-water, wine-whey,
egg-nog, and similar aliments must be given in small doses and
frequently.Nutrient enemata, prepared from eggs, milk, and beef-juice,
with the materials for digestion--acid and pepsin--may be made to
supplement the stomach, but such efforts have a very limited utility,
owing to the state of the hepatic functions and to the obstruction of
the portal circuit.In all cases it is necessary to maintain the
strength by suitable aliment and the judicious use of stimulants.The
long-continued and profuse suppuration makes an enormous demand on the
vital resources of the patient, and this must be compensated by
suitable food-supplies.As the formation of pus has taken place in most cases when symptoms
have begun, the question of highest importance is, Shall the pus be
evacuated?The statistical evidence relating to this question becomes
then an extremely valuable guide.As in almost all cases of puncture of
the liver for the evacuation of an abscess some part of the liver
substance must be passed through, it is necessary to note how far this
can be done without inflicting permanent injury on the organ.Hammond
has punctured the liver in eight cases without the presence of an
abscess, and of these not one has presented any unfavorable symptom.The author has punctured the liver, penetrating well into the interior,
in two cases in which no abscess was discovered, but the symptoms of
hepatitis existed, with the effect to improve the symptoms.In
Condon's[113] collection of 11 cases there were 8 of abscess evacuated
by the trocar, and 3 of acute hepatitis in which abscess had not
formed, but in which the puncture procured the most decided
amelioration of the symptoms.We have heretofore referred to Hammond's
experience in the puncture of the liver in cases of hypochondriasis,
this condition appearing to depend in some instances on the presence of
abscess.In a number of instances abscesses did exist, but in many
others there was no apparent lesion of the liver, but in these cases
the puncture of the organ was without any ill result.Testimony to the
same effect is given by Ramirez,[114] who asserts that he had not known
a single instance in which any ill result followed puncture of the
liver.It may therefore be regarded as certain that exploratory
puncture of the organ for the purpose of diagnosis as well as for
treatment can at any time be performed with suitable precautions in
respect to the size, condition, and character of the instrument.[Footnote 113: "On the Use of the Aspirator in Hepatic Abscess," Dr.E.
H. Condon, _The Lancet_ (London), August, 1877.][Footnote 114: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
recueilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, p.The authorities of most experience are agreed that, provided with the
{1022} aspirator, the abscess may be punctured as soon as a purulent
collection can be ascertained to exist.The obvious reason for tapping
the abscess is its tendency to extend in various directions, destroying
the hepatic substance.In those examples confined by a limiting
membrane, after a time of inactivity ulceration begins, and the pus
seeks an outlet in some direction.The early evacuation by a suitable
aspirator becomes then a measure of the highest necessity.The good
effects of puncture with even such a crude instrument as the trocar is
well exhibited in the statistics collected by Waring.[115] In a
collection of 81 cases opened by the knife or trocar there were 66
deaths, making the percentage of recoveries 18.5.In these cases the
operative procedure was a final measure, and the mischief had been done
almost if not quite in its entirety.The statistics of Waring are
concerned with a period anterior to 1850.Although they demonstrate the
value of the trocar and evacuation of the abscess, as compared with the
results of the natural course of the disease, the far greater success
of the treatment by the aspirator is shown by the statistics of recent
times.Thus in McConnell's[116] 14 cases, also of India, in which the
aspirator was used to empty the sac, 8 recovered and 6 died.The
statistics of Waring may also be profitably compared with those of
Condon,[117] in which, of 8 cases of abscess evacuated by the
aspirator, 4 recovered, or 50 per cent.They may also be compared with
Sach's[118] cases, 21 in number, of which 8 recovered, or 38 per cent.,
and with the cases of De Castro[119] of Alexandria, who reports 22
large abscesses operated on, the proportion of cures being 31.8 per
100, and 10 small abscesses, the proportion of cures being 70 per 100.In a case seen in consultation with Collins, in this city, last year,
the aspirator was used by us about three months after the symptoms of
abscess declared themselves.About a quart of bloody pus was drawn off
at once, the opening sealed, and no subsequent accumulation occurred,
the patient entirely recovering, for after a year he was seen
(December, 1884) in complete health.From these data we draw the
important conclusion that early operation is desirable.This fact may
be formulated in the expression: In all cases of hepatic abscess use
the aspirator whenever the presence of pus is made out.When the
abscess is large, and especially when communication is established with
the parietes of the abdomen, a free opening, followed by the insertion
of a drainage-tube, is the proper method to pursue.If the pus
reaccumulates, it is good practice to inject the cavity with tincture
or compound solution of iodine after the pus is drawn off, provided the
dimensions of the abscess are not too great.[Footnote 115: _An Inquiry into the Statistics of Abscess of the
Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 116: "Remarks on Pneumatic Aspiration, with Cases of Abscess
of the Liver treated by this Method," _Indian Annals of Medical
Science_, July, 1872, quoted.][Footnote 117: _Lancet_, _supra_.][Footnote 118: _Ueber die Hepatitis der heissen Lander, etc._, von Dr.[Footnote 119: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, par le Docteur S. V. de Castro (d'Alexandrie
d'Egypte), Paris, 1870, p.As regards the mode of proceeding, the following are useful rules:
Ascertain, if possible, the existence of fluctuation; locate the point
where the walls of the abscess are thinnest; insert an
exploring-needle, and if the depot of pus is reached substitute a
trocar having a sufficient calibre to evacuate the contents of the
abscess; observe antiseptic precautions in respect to each detail of
the operative procedure, and after the removal of the canula or needle,
if a drainage-tube is not necessary, close the {1023} wound
antiseptically.If drainage is necessary, keep the cavity empty and use
proper solutions to prevent septic decomposition.When an abscess of
the liver is pointing, the best place to puncture is where the abscess
is most prominent and it walls thinnest, but if the accumulation of pus
is encysted and there is no attempt at effecting an exit, the
exploring-needle should be passed into the interior of the right lobe,
the most usual site of suppuration.If pus be reached, a larger trocar
may be inserted to evacuate the cavity thoroughly.Repeated insertion
of the needle-trocar is preferable when the abscess is small, but when
the accumulation is large and sufficiently firm attachments to the
abdominal parietes exist, a drainage-tube will be necessary.In what direction soever discharge of an abscess may take place, the
general indications are to support the powers of life by food and
stimulants.It is useful, by
the application of a firm flannel bandage, to keep the liver in its
proper position and maintain it there.When pointing of an abscess
occurs, a large flaxseed poultice is a soothing and a mechanically
supporting application.DEFINITION.--By the term acute yellow atrophy is meant an acute
affection of the liver, characterized by rapid wasting or degeneration
of the organ, accompanied by the systemic symptoms belonging to an
acute acholia or cholaemia.It is an acute, diffused inflammation, with
atrophy of the proper gland-elements.It has been called icterus
gravis, malignant icterus, hemorrhagic icterus, malignant jaundice,
etc.HISTORY.--Cases having a more or less exact resemblance to acute yellow
atrophy have been occasionally reported from the earliest period.Amongst English physicians, Bright[120] was one of the first to give an
accurate account of the clinical history of some well-defined cases.Rokitansky[121] was really the first to define the disease from the
pathological standpoint, and it was he who designated it acute yellow
atrophy, this term being intended to signify the nature of the
objective changes.The first treatise ever published on the disease as
a distinct morbid entity was the monograph of Horaezek,[122] which
appeared in 1843.Amongst the French, Ozonam in 1847 was the first to
recognize and describe the disease as a distinct affection, although
Andral[123] had several years before mentioned an affection of the
liver which corresponded in some of its features to this affection.In
1862, Wagner[124] asserted that many of the cases of acute yellow
atrophy were only examples of acute phosphorus-poisoning, and that no
real distinction exists between the two affections.This statement has
been warmly disputed by various German observers, but there is no doubt
a close resemblance between the two affections.[Footnote 120: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1836, vol.[Footnote 121: _Handbook of Pathological Anatomy_, Am.[Footnote 122: Quoted by Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 123: _Clinique medicale_, 1839, tome ii.[Footnote 124: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1862, p.CAUSES.--There can be no doubt that acute yellow atrophy is a very rare
disease, since so few examples are found post-mortem.In the course of
a very large experience in autopsical examinations I have met with but
{1024} one characteristic example.[125] According to Legg, it is "one
of the rarest diseases known to man."[Footnote 125: _General Field Hospital_, December, 1863.]Several theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence of this
affection, but without success.It has been ascribed to an excess in
the production of bile, to stasis in the bile, and to a sudden
saturation of the hepatic cells with biliary matters contained in the
portal vein.That these supposed causes are really influential in
producing the malady can hardly be entertained.That there is a
peculiar poison which has a causative relation to the disease is
rendered probable by the fact that a condition closely allied to this
disease is produced by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other
poisons.Is it not a ptomaine generated under unknown conditions in the
intestine?Especially does the morbid anatomy of phosphorus-poisoning
nearly agree in all its details with icterus gravis--so nearly that by
many German authorities they are held to be identical.Age has a certain influence in the causation of this disease.It is
rarely seen in early life, Lebert in a collection of 63 cases having
found only 2 before ten years of age, yet there has been a well-marked
case at three, and Hilton Fagge reports one at two and a half years of
age.Nevertheless, much the largest number occur between fifteen and
twenty-five years of age, and the maximum age may be fixed at sixty.The influence of sex in the pathogeny is most remarkable.It is true in
Lebert's collection of 72 cases there were 44 men and 28 women, but it
is now known that he did not properly discriminate in his selection of
supposed examples of the disease.The statistics of all other observers
are opposed to those of Lebert.Thus, in Frerichs' collection of 31
cases, carefully sifted to eliminate error, there were 22 women and 9
men.Legg has also collected 100 cases of acute yellow atrophy, and of
these 69 were women or girls.The most active period of life--from
twenty to thirty years of age--is the usual period for the appearance
of this disease.More than one-half of Lebert's cases occurred between
fifteen and twenty-five; and of Frerichs', two-thirds happened between
twenty and thirty years of age.In Legg's collection of 100 cases, 76
were between fifteen and thirty-five years of age.What is the
condition of women at this period in life which renders them so
susceptible to this malady?There can be no doubt that pregnancy is the
great factor.Of 69 cases especially interrogated on this point,
examined into by Legg, in 25 pregnancy was ascertained to exist.In
Frerichs' collection one-half were women in the condition of pregnancy.The period of pregnancy at which the disease appears varies from the
fourth to the ninth month, the greatest number occurring at the sixth
month.So long ago as 1848, Virchow drew attention to the remarkable
changes in the liver due to pregnancy.Sinety[126] has studied the
effect of lactation on the liver, and has ascertained the existence of
fatty degeneration.There is a form of jaundice which accompanies
menstruation, as shown by Senator,[127] Hirschberg, and others.These
facts indicate a certain relationship between the sexual system of the
female and the liver, but they do not indicate the nature of the
connection, if any exist, between this condition and acute yellow
atrophy.[Footnote 126: _De l'Etat du Foie chez les Femelles en Lactation_,
Paris, 1873 (pamphlet).][Footnote 127: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1872, p.615, "Ueber
Menstruelle Gelbsucht."]The influence of depressing emotions has been supposed to be effective
{1025} in producing this disease, but it is more than doubtful if such
a relationship exists.Lebert, however, refers 13 of his cases to this
cause, but Legg, who bases his statements on the study of 100
carefully-recorded cases, is sceptical regarding the effect of such
influences.Syphilis has in some instances appeared to be the
principal, if not the only, pathogenetic factor, and Legg[128] compares
the action of the virus of syphilis to the effect of phosphorus,
mercury, etc.[Footnote 128: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The anatomical changes occurring in this disease
indicate the existence of a systemic condition: the lesions are not
limited to the liver, but involve various other organs.The changes in
the liver should be first described, since the name of the disease is
derived from the alterations in this organ.As the name indicates, the
lesions are atrophic, but not all examples show this.In some cases
there is little change in the size of the organ; in others the wasting
is extreme; certainly in all typical examples the liver is reduced in
size.The variations in size observed are probably due to the stage at
which the inspection is made: if early, the organ may not be reduced in
size, may be even somewhat enlarged by the deposition of new material;
if later, the atrophic changes will be more or less pronounced.When
the atrophy has taken place, the size of the liver is reduced to
one-half, even to one-third, of its original dimensions; it is then
soft, almost like pulp, and cannot maintain its shape, but flattens out
on the table.The capsule is much wrinkled and the color of the organ
is yellowish, variegated by islets of reddish or brownish-red color,
these spots being somewhat depressed below the general surface and
having a firm texture.On section the boundaries of the lobules are
either lost or have become very indistinct, the line of section being
bloodless.The knife with which the sections are made becomes greasy.In some instances ecchymoses are discovered under the capsule, and
rarely hemorrhagic extravasations in the substance of the liver.The
bile-ducts are found intact, as a rule.The greatest change in the size
of the liver is observed in the left lobe.The duration of the disease,
as has been indicated above, has a marked influence over the size and
condition of the liver.The atrophic shrinking of the liver occurs more
decidedly after the ninth day.In general, the tissue of the liver is
soft and pulpy in consistence.On microscopic examination the most
important alterations are seen to have occurred in the hepatic cells;
ultimately, these cells disappear, being replaced by fatty and
connective-tissue detritus; but before this stage is reached important
alterations have taken place in the form and structure of these bodies:
the cells become granular and fatty, and lose their sharpness and
regularity of contour, especially at the periphery of the lobule, but
ultimately all the cells within the lobule undergo atrophic
degeneration.In this atrophic degeneration of the hepatic cells, in
their fatty degeneration, and ultimately entire disappearance, consist
the real proofs of the disease.The red islets of tissue already
alluded to consist of the fatty detritus mixed with crystals of
haematoidin.More or less increase of the connective tissue is noted in many of the
cases--increase of connective tissue with numerous young cells formed
around the vessels and the bile-ducts (Waldeyer[129]).The changes in
the {1026} liver would surely be incomplete without some references to
the minute organisms which play so important a part in modern
pathology.Waldeyer was the first to demonstrate the presence of
bacteria in the pigment-remains of the hepatic cells.Other observers
have been unable to detect them, so that at present the parasitic
origin of this affection remains sub judice.Important changes also take place in the spleen, but the opinions on
this point are somewhat contradictory.Frerichs found the spleen
enlarged in most of his cases; Liebermeister, on the other hand, and
Legg,[130] find that the spleen is enlarged in about one-third of the
cases.When the atrophic changes occur in the liver, more or less
swelling of the splenic veins must occur in consequence of portal
obstruction.The peritoneum, especially the omental part, is the seat
of multiple ecchymoses, and the endothelium is fatty.The mesenteric
glands are usually swollen.More or less blackish or brownish fluid,
consisting of altered blood, is usually found in the stomach, and the
same, assuming a tar-like consistence, in the large intestine.Ecchymoses of rather small size are distributed over the stomach and
intestines.The epithelium of the stomach-glands is found granular and
disintegrating, and a catarrhal state of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane exists throughout.The secretions are never normal, and the
stools are wanting in bile or present a tarry appearance, due to the
presence of blood.[Footnote 130: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _supra_.]They consist essentially
in a granular and fatty degeneration of the tubular epithelium, whence
the altered appearance of the cortex.Multitudes of bacteria crowd the
pyramids.Ecchymoses also are found in the mucous membrane of the
pelvis of the kidney, in the bladder, and indeed all along the
genito-urinary tract.The muscular tissue of the heart is in a state of acute fatty
degeneration, beginning with a granular change which may at the outset
be of very limited extent and involve but few fibres.The endo- and
pericardium are studded with ecchymoses or marked by hemorrhagic
extravasations, and the pleura presents similar appearances, but not to
the same extent.The brain does not always show evidences of change, but in many
instances there are ecchymoses of the meninges; the walls of the
vessels are affected by fatty degeneration.The tissues of the body are more or less deeply stained with bile.The
pathological change on which the jaundice depends has been variously
stated, but the most probable explanation is that which refers it to
mechanical obstruction of the bile-ducts, either by catarrhal swelling
or fatty degeneration of the epithelium.Notwithstanding the prominence
of the hepatic symptoms, acute atrophy of the liver is probably only
one element in a constitutional morbid complexus.SYMPTOMS.--Acute yellow atrophy begins in two modes--the grave symptoms
preceded by mild prodromes, or the most serious symptoms appear at the
onset.The usual prodromes are
referable to the gastro-intestinal canal, and consist of loss of
appetite, nausea, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and
general malaise.Indeed, the opening attack may be much like an {1027}
ordinary bilious seizure or acute gastro-duodenal catarrh or a sick
headache.In some cases the initial symptoms--nausea and
diarrhoea--appear to be induced by an indigestible article of food.Jaundice never fails to be present at some period, but is usually one
of the prodromic symptoms.It has no special characteristics by which
the gravity of the approaching seizure may be measured.It is usually
rather deep, and all parts are deeply stained, but the coloration may
be limited to the body and upper extremities.No change in pulse or
temperature, except the usual depression of both functions, is to be
observed; the urine is deeply stained with pigment, and the feces are
grayish, colorless, or parti-.The period of time elapsing before the serious symptoms come on is not
constant; from one week to several months have been the variations
observed.In a minority of the cases no prodromes have occurred, but
the grave symptoms have declared themselves at once.From the
appearance of the jaundice up to the onset of severe symptoms the time
has varied from two weeks to several months, but has rarely exceeded
three months.During this time there may be nothing to indicate the
gravity of the approaching symptoms; in fact, the case then, as at the
onset, seems to be one of simple gastro-duodenal catarrh associated
with catarrhal jaundice.The onset of serious symptoms is most usually
announced by dilatation of the pupil.If, therefore, in a case of
apparently simple catarrhal jaundice, especially in a pregnant female,
there should occur without apparent reason a marked and persistent
dilatation of the pupil, the possibility of the case being one of acute
atrophy should be apprehended.This symptom is not, alone, of
sufficient value to decide the character of the case, but then an
obstinate insomnia comes on, violent headache is experienced, there is
more or less confusion of mind, and jactitations or an extreme
restlessness occurs.When such pronounced nervous symptoms appear the
character of the attack is explained.Various divisions have been proposed to mark the type of the symptoms:
thus, the icteric period embraces the prodromal symptoms with jaundice;
the toxaemic period is that stage characterized by profound nervous
disturbances.Ozonam has divided the symptoms into those of the
prodromal period and those of the serious stage, the latter being
subdivided into the symptoms of excitation and those of collapse.There
may be no prodromal period, however; without any preliminary symptoms
the patient is suddenly seized with delirium and passes into a
condition of coma and insensibility, or the first evidence of serious
illness may be convulsions.It is probable, however, that in even the
most sudden cases mild prodromal symptoms had occurred, but were
overlooked.There is much variability in the symptoms of the toxaemic
period.There are three symptoms: excitement with delirium, sometimes
delirium ferox; coma, less or more profound; and convulsions.Legg has
numerically expressed the relative frequency of these symptoms thus: Of
100 cases of unquestionable acute atrophy, 76 had become comatose, 59
were delirious, and 32 had suffered convulsions.[131] According to the
same authority, delirium and coma were associated together in about
one-half of the cases, but in pregnant women coma often occurs alone
(Legg).Usually, when convulsions happen there has been either coma or
delirium.With these cerebral symptoms there are often present various
{1028} disturbances of motility and sensibility, such as local
convulsions, jactitations, hiccough, extreme restlessness, paralysis of
the sphincters, and incontinence of urine and feces or retention,
grinding of the teeth, exalted sensibility of the skin, or it may be
complete anaesthesia, severe itching of the surface, etc.[Footnote 131: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

During the toxaemic period, and directly dependent on the retention of
excrementitious matters in the blood, hemorrhages occur from the mucous
surfaces, from wounds, and into the various serous membranes.A changed
state of the blood being present in all cases of this disease, the
proportion in which extravasations take place is high--in about 71.3
per cent.according to Liebermeister, and 80 per cent.The latter author regards these estimates as rather low.When
hemorrhage occurs in the stomach in small amount, it presents itself as
coffee-grounds or as black vomit, and in the intestine in the form of
black, tarry stools or melaena.Hemorrhage may also occur from the
surface of an ulcer, from a fresh wound, a leech-bite, etc.; but the
most usual form of extravasation of blood after the gastro-intestinal
is epistaxis or bleeding from the nose.Women who abort, as they are
very apt to do when this disease comes on, may suffer from frightful
hemorrhage, and deaths have been thus caused.Various opinions have
been expressed as to the cause of the hemorrhagic condition--by some
attributed to the changes in the composition of the blood; by others to
the alterations of the vessel walls; both factors are doubtless
concerned.During the prodromic period the temperature of the body, as in the case
of ordinary uncomplicated jaundice, is rather depressed below normal,
sometimes as much as two degrees; but when the toxaemic stage comes on
the body-heat rises to a variable extent, but usually over 100 degrees
F. In some cases no febrile movement can be detected; in others a very
considerable elevation of temperature occurs, but very rarely attains
to 105 degrees or 106 degrees F. The pulse becomes very rapid, in some
instances rising to 140; but without any apparent cause it may fall
suddenly to 70 or 80, and these fluctuations may take place several
times a day.The rise of temperature and a very rapid pulse may come on
in the final coma only; and immediately after death, as Legg points
out, the body-heat may attain the maximum elevation.As the toxaemic period develops the tongue becomes dry, glazed,
fissured, sordes form on the teeth and lips, the breath becomes fetid,
and the breathing may assume the Cheyne-Stokes type.The nausea and
vomiting of the prodromal period persist, and the ominous
coffee-grounds appear in the rejected matters, or grumous masses--clots
acted on by the gastric juice--are brought up.Black, pitch-like, or
tarry stools, the result of hemorrhage, are passed toward the
end--involuntarily when liquid.When no blood is present the stools are
grayish and without bile.Constipation may be the condition instead of
diarrhoea in about one-third of the cases.Various eruptions have been observed on the skin, such as petechiae,
roseola, eczema, etc., but their very variety, as their occasional
appearance, indicates their accidental relationship to the disease.The urine is much altered in character, but it is usually acid in
reaction, although it has been observed neutral or alkaline.The
specific gravity is at or nearly normal, and it has a deep-brownish or
bilious hue {1029} due to the presence of bile-pigment.The most
important change in the composition of the urine is the diminished
quantity of urea or its entire disappearance; the phosphates, and
especially the chlorides, are also usually diminished in amount; and
albumen and leucin and tyrosin appear to a lesser or greater extent,
together with hyaline, fatty, and granular casts.Although the observations are somewhat contradictory, it seems pretty
definitely established that the blood is more or less altered in
composition, morphological and chemical.The red corpuscles are
diminished in amount, and often deformed; the white corpuscles are
increased; and excrementitious products--urea, leucin, tyrosin, and
cholesterin--are found in greater or less quantity.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Although, as a rule, the course of
acute atrophy is rapid, it is not invariably so.In some instances the
prodromic symptoms have continued through several months, but,
according to Thierfelder, one-half of the cases terminate in from three
to five weeks, and in only 10 per cent.The course of the disease is extremely rapid in pregnant
females, rarely extending beyond the second week.An extended course of
the disease is due to delay in the prodromic stage, the toxaemic period
being always absolutely and relatively shorter.In the condition of
pregnancy the danger is increased by the hemorrhages, and the early
termination is due chiefly to this factor.When the duration of the
disease is protracted and its evolution normal, the accumulation of
hepatic excrementitious matters sets up cerebral disturbance, which
becomes a pronounced feature of the case.As in the
course of the disease the hepatic cells undergo solution and
disintegration, their restoration can hardly be regarded as possible,
certainly not probable.Any curative result must, then, be wrought in
the prodromic period, when the diagnosis must be viewed with some
mistrust.DIAGNOSIS.--George Harley[132] maintains the singular doctrine that
acute yellow atrophy is only the "sporadic form of the contagious
jaundice of the tropics," or yellow fever.He bases his opinion on the
identity of their symptoms, pathological anatomy, mortality, and
contagious character; for he affirms that acute yellow atrophy may
exhibit contagious power in temperate climates.[Footnote 132: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.As acute yellow atrophy comes on as an ordinary catarrhal jaundice, it
is impossible to distinguish it from the latter affection during the
prodromal period.When cerebral symptoms, black vomit, and tarry stools
appear, the area of hepatic dulness very decidedly diminishes, and
leucin and tyrosin replace urea in the urine, acute atrophy may be
suspected.Acute phosphorus-poisoning, as regards its symptomatology and morbid
anatomy, does not differ from acute yellow atrophy, and many cases of
the latter have been mistaken, it is supposed, for the former.To
distinguish between them the history of the case must be carefully
ascertained.When, after the prodromal symptoms, which may not be accurately
diagnosticated, there occurs a rapid decline in the area of hepatic
dulness, hemorrhages take place from the mucous surfaces, stupor and
delirium {1030} supervene, and urea disappears from the urine, being
replaced by leucin and tyrosin, there can be no difficulty in coming to
a conclusion: the case must be one of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--It was formerly supposed that a case of acute yellow
atrophy must necessarily prove fatal, but this opinion must now be
modified, since examples of cure of supposed cases have been reported
from Oppolzer's clinic,[133] by Lebert,[134] by Harley,[135] and
others.As at the onset the symptoms cannot be distinguished from a
bilious attack or from catarrhal jaundice, the treatment must be
appropriate to these states.When the serious symptoms begin, a large
dose (scruple j) of quinine should be at once administered, and half
the quantity at regular intervals to keep up the cinchonism.Phosphate
of soda, with some arseniate and such mild hepatic stimulants as
euonymin, iridin, etc., should be given to maintain a gentle aperient
action.Experience has proved that active or drastic cathartics do harm
rather than good; on the other hand, mild laxatives, especially those
having cholagogue action, seem to do good.[Footnote 133: Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

[Footnote 134: _Ibid._]

[Footnote 135: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.Important symptoms arising during the toxaemic period require remedies
to combat them.Nausea and vomiting, and also diarrhoea, are best
relieved by carbolic acid and bismuth in combination.Hemorrhage
requires, when intestinal, the chloride and perchloride of iron; when
from other mucous surfaces, ergotin, gallic acid, and other
haemostatics.The depression of the vital forces should be treated by
small and frequently-repeated doses of alcohol, by quinine, by iron,
and, under some conditions, by digitalis.After the disintegration of
the hepatic cells has been produced no remedies can be of any service.Until this occurs, however, it seems to the author well worth while to
attempt to stay the destruction by the administration of those remedies
which, by their accumulation in that organ, indicate a special affinity
for its tissue.These drugs are phosphorus, antimony, gold, silver, and
mercuric chloride.By the timely administration of one or more of these
would it not be possible to stay the progress of the atrophic
degeneration?The Liver in Phosphorus-Poisoning.DEFINITION.--Poisoning by phosphorus may seem to be a toxicological
question rather than a merely hepatic disease, but as the morbid
complexus thus induced is so similar to acute yellow atrophy that the
conditions are regarded as identical by many of our German colleagues,
it is necessary to enter into some details regarding it.PATHOGENY.--Phosphorus-poisoning occurs at any period from youth to old
age, but is most common from twenty to thirty years of age.Women seem
more inclined to effect self-destruction in this way than are men,
probably because phosphorus matches are so readily obtained.Children
may munch match-heads in a spirit of mischief.That form of chronic
poisoning seen in workmen in match-factories, and consisting in
necrosis of bone, etc., does not come within the scope of the present
inquiry.A body poisoned by phosphorus does not exhibit a tendency to
putrefactive decomposition within the usual period.The tissues are
more or less {1031} deeply stained by bile-pigment, and this coloration
extends to pathological fluids as well.The serous and mucous membranes
contain points of blood-extravasation, but they are especially numerous
in the serous membranes.Hemorrhages of this kind are due to two
causes--to the disorganization of the blood, and to fatty degeneration
of the arterioles.The heart is also more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration, the muscles granular, the striations obscure or
obliterated, and the whole soft and easily torn.The spleen is usually
enlarged--often, indeed, to twice its natural size.The liver presents
highly-characteristic alterations.When death occurs early the organ is
generally enlarged, infiltrated with fat, the connective tissue
undergoing hyperplasia; but in more advanced cases atrophy has taken
place, the cells have disappeared and are replaced by fat-granules,
crystals of leucin and tyrosin, connective tissue, etc.--in fact, the
changes characteristic of acute yellow atrophy.The jaundice has been
variously interpreted.As the bile-ducts in advanced cases are found to
contain no bile, but only a colorless mucus, the advocates of a
haematogenic jaundice hold that the jaundice is due to a failure of the
liver to excrete the biliary principles in the blood; whilst the
opponents of this view maintain the existence of an obstruction in the
ultimate ducts.Harley[136] has recently brought forward some strong
facts and arguments--which we believe can be successfully
controverted--maintaining the former view.The jaundice of
phosphorus-poisoning, if Harley's opinion prove to be correct, must be
regarded as a haematogenic jaundice.[Footnote 136: _Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

The mucous membrane of the stomach, as might be supposed, is more or
less ulcerated or in an advanced state of catarrh, and the gastric
glands are affected by fatty degeneration.The kidneys are affected in a similar manner to the liver; the
epithelium is fatty and sometimes detached, and the same process is
found to occur in the vessels and epithelium of the cortex.SYMPTOMS.--Not only in the morbid anatomy, but in the symptoms, do we
find that a very remarkable resemblance exists between acute yellow
atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning.As phosphorus is usually swallowed in
bulk, some hours may elapse before the local symptoms begin, for the
contents of the stomach and the tough mucus lining the mucous membrane
may, and usually do, prevent immediate contact of the poison with the
mucous membrane.When the stomach is entirely empty the symptoms may
begin in an hour or two.The symptoms produced may be arranged in two
groups--those due to the local irritation excited by the poison; those
due to its systemic impression.In the first group belong burning in
the gullet, pain, nausea, and vomiting.According to Lewin,[137] who
has collected a number of cases for analysis, vomiting occurs in 26 out
of 32 instances of poisoning.Some hours--often, indeed, three or four
days--then elapse before the systemic symptoms begin.Vomiting, which
was for the time being suspended, occurs again, and instead of the mere
contents of the stomach, containing more or less phosphorus, blood,
somewhat changed by the gastric juice--chocolate- or as
coffee-grounds--appears in the vomited matters.The evacuations from
the bowels may at first, as the contents of the stomach, appear
phosphorescent, and afterward exhibit the appearances due to the
presence in them {1032} of altered blood.At this time, if the liver be
examined it will be found somewhat enlarged and tender to pressure, and
on or about the third day jaundice appears; but it should not be
overlooked that jaundice, as Bamberger[138] has shown, may be postponed
to the second or third week after the phosphorus has been taken.[Footnote 137: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xxi.514 _et seq._]

[Footnote 138: Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_,
_loc.cit._]

In favorable cases the area of hepatic dulness decreases and the
jaundice declines.In the fatal cases certain nervous phenomena become
prominent.There occur drowsiness, developing into coma, with
intercurrent attacks of delirium which may be of a maniacal character;
convulsions, spasmodic attacks, dilated pupils, and involuntary
evacuations.The disorganization of the blood and the fatty change in
the vessels are exhibited in the hemorrhages from the gastro-intestinal
mucous membrane.The nervous phenomena are due chiefly to the retention
in the blood of various excrementitious matters which it is the
function of the liver to separate from the blood.Flint's theory of
cholesteraemia has been so abundantly disproved that no one upholds it
at the present time, but the cerebral symptoms are properly referred to
the retention of all hepatic excrement.The temperature in phosphorus-poisoning rises from 99 degrees to 102
degrees F., but it may reach in severe cases to 103 degrees to 105
degrees F., and at death or immediately afterward to 105 degrees, even
to 107 degrees F. The same fact is true of acute yellow atrophy.With
the jaundice the pulse declines, but in the further progress of the
case, especially toward the close, the pulse becomes rapid and small.The changes occurring in the urine are highly significant.The amount
of urea decreases as the symptoms increase in severity, and leucin and
tyrosin take its place.If the case tends to recovery the urea again
increases in amount, but if the tendency is in the opposite direction
the quantity of urea steadily diminishes.Bile acids and bile-pigment
are found in quantity, and albumen is present in small amount.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Phosphorus-poisoning is necessarily
an acute affection, but the duration of cases is much influenced by the
form in which the poison is taken.If in a liquid and diffusible form,
as oleum phosphoratum, the local and systemic symptoms will develop in
a few hours, but if in solid masses, as particles of match-heads, many
hours (six to ten) may elapse before the local irritation begins.The
proportion of cures in phosphorus-poisoning varies from one-fourth to
one-half of the cases.Much depends, however, on the promptness and
efficiency of the treatment.The prognosis is the more favorable the
earlier proper measures of relief have been instituted.If the case has
proceeded to jaundice, hemorrhages, black vomit, etc.without the
administration of suitable antidotes, little can be expected from any
kind of treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of any case involved in doubt is indispensable
to a correct conclusion.The phosphorescent appearance of the matters
vomited or passed by stool may make the differentiation comparatively
easy; but if the case has passed beyond this stage,
phosphorus-poisoning can be separated from acute yellow atrophy only by
the history of the case.If the fact of the administration of
phosphorus is successfully concealed, no differentiation can be made,
since {1033} even the best authorities hold to the identity of the
toxic symptoms produced by this poison and of the morbid anatomy, with
the symptoms and lesions of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--The poison should be evacuated as quickly as possible by
emetics and proper diluents.The best emetics are sulphate of copper,
apomorphia, and ipecacuanha, the antimonial and mercurial emetics being
unsuited, since their effects are similar to those of phosphorus.Oleaginous protectives do not prevent, but really favor, the absorption
of phosphorus.Decoctions of flaxseed, slippery elm, acacia, etc.are
suitable demulcents and protectives.The fatty matter in food, eggs,
etc.will have an injurious effect by promoting the solution and
absorption of the phosphorus, and should hence be excluded from the
diet.The most effective antidote is oleum terebinthinae, and the most
suitable preparation is the French acid oil.Freshly-distilled
turpentine appears to be almost if not entirely useless.It is probable
that the American oil which is old and has been exposed to the air for
many months will answer the purpose, but it cannot be too strongly
insisted on that the turpentine which has proved to be efficient in
phosphorus-poisoning is the French acid oil.Turpentine when exposed to
the air absorbs oxygen as ozone, and to this principle are probably due
the curative effects of old turpentine.Phosphorus when acted on by
this agent is converted into a spermaceti-like substance entirely
devoid of toxic power.As rapidly as possible the poison should be
acted on by the antidote, and then the stomach should be evacuated,
using, caeteris paribus, the sulphate of copper, since this forms an
insoluble phosphide with any portion of free phosphorus, whilst at the
same time it empties the stomach of its contents.Although the
immediate results of the poison may be thus removed, the damage to the
red corpuscles and to the whole mass of the blood requires special
management.The success of transfusion, as practised by Jurgensen,[139]
proves that the substitution of fresh blood may save life when the
existing blood-supply is inadequate to the performance of its proper
functions.It follows that if the toxic effects of phosphorus have
continued for several days, blood-transfusion will be necessary in
those cases characterized by an inability to recuperate notwithstanding
the successful removal of the poison.[Footnote 139: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, No.For the inflammatory symptoms produced by the local action of
phosphorus, opium in some form is indispensable.This remedy is equally
valuable as a means of maintaining the vital resources and to prevent
the evil results of shock and inflammation.DEFINITION.--Under the term carcinoma of the liver are included primary
and secondary cancer of the liver.The malady with which we are now
concerned is the primary affection, occurring in the organ proper or in
some pathological new formation connected with it.ETIOLOGY.--Heredity is the most important factor.A careful
investigation of the reported examples demonstrates that from 15 to 20
per cent.owe their origin to hereditary influence clearly, and
probably {1034} considerably more are indirectly derived in this way
when the immediate connection may not be demonstrable.Next to
heredity, age must be regarded as the most important pathogenetic
influence, much the largest number occurring at from forty to sixty
years of age.It is a malady of advanced life, therefore, rather than
of youth or middle age.Excluding the female organs from consideration,
it is quite certain that sex has little special influence, and that
males and females are affected about equally.Primary cancer of the liver is comparatively infrequent, occurring in
not more than one-fourth of the cases.Frerichs collected 91 cases, and
of these 46 were secondary to cancer in organs having vascular
communication with the liver.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Under the term cancer of the liver are included
several distinct forms of morbid growth, but united in the
characteristic of malignancy.From the merely clinical standpoint this
characteristic is the most decisive bond of union between them, and
serves as the point of departure in the study of this affection.Primary cancer of the liver is divisible into two forms: 1, as a
single, defined tumor; 2, as an infiltration through the whole mass of
the organ.[140] Secondary cancer occurs in nodular masses, and with
extreme rarity as an infiltration.The form of cancer is really the
same; the differences in structure are only apparent, the variations
being due to the relative proportion of cells, fibres, and vessels.If
the fibrous stroma is abundant and the cells small in quantity, the
form of structure approaches scirrhus; on the other hand, if the cells
largely preponderate, the type is encephaloid; if vessels predominate,
it is called telangiectatic.The usual form in cancer of the liver is
the soft, cellular variety, encephaloid or medullary.When the
cancerous new formation is nodular, the masses vary in size from a pea
to a child's head,[141] and are numerous inversely as their size.When
the cancer occurs as a solitary tumor, it may attain to enormous
dimensions.It has a spherical shape usually, protrudes from the
surface of the organ somewhat irregularly, and the overlying peritoneum
is thickened, cloudy, and adherent from a local inflammation.The
central portion, whether there be one, several, or many nodules, is
depressed, giving an umbilicated appearance to the tumor; and this
central depression is found to be soft, almost diffluent, and full of
juice.The fibrous stroma which extends through this central soft
material has a reticulated arrangement and a shining, fibrous
appearance.The cancerous masses are not confined to these nodules, but
extend into the surrounding hepatic structure, push their way into the
portal (especially the hepatic) veins, block the ducts, and invade the
lymphatic glands in the fissure of the liver.[Footnote 140: Virchow, _Krankhaften Geschwulste_, _loc.cit._; Perls,
_Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.448 _et seq._;
Frerichs, _A Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.281 _et seq._]

[Footnote 141: Forster, _Lehrbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_, by
Seibert, Jena, 1873.]When the cancerous new formation takes the form of an infiltration of
the organ instead of distinct nodules, the liver is usually uniformly
enlarged and its outlines preserved.[142] The peritoneum is opaque,
thickened, and adherent.The organ is traversed by fibrous bands, and
the {1035} intervening portion is a soft, juicy pulp, stained by the
imbibition of bile.In extreme cases hardly any portion of the proper
hepatic tissue remains, but is replaced by a cancerous new formation
having the same shape.[Footnote 142: Perls, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lvi.448 _et seq._]

As regards the minute structure of cancer of the liver, it may be
regarded as a degeneration (cancerous) of the proper gland-cells and of
the epithelium of the bile-ducts.As cancer develops in the liver it is
to be noted that the cellular elements preponderate over the fibrous or
the stroma, and hence the new formation presents the characteristics of
softness, rapid growth, and a multitudinous cellular hyperplasia.As
regards the form of the new cells, it cannot now be doubted that they
are descendants of the secretory gland-cells and of the epithelial
lining of the ducts.According to some observers, it is to the
proliferation of the proper gland-cells that the new formations owe
their origin; according to others, to the hyperplasia of the cells
lining the ducts.As the growth of the new formation can take place
only through an adequate blood-supply, it becomes very important to
ascertain its source.There can be little doubt that primary cancer of
the liver receives its nutrient supply through the hepatic artery, in
connection with which new capillaries form in the pathological tissue.Secondary cancer of the liver is the usual form of the specific
manifestation.From the merely clinical standpoint the primary
affection is the more important.From the pathological point of view
the secondary implication of the liver may be a true metastasis or a
mere communication by contiguity of tissue.The most usual metastasis
occurs from epithelial cancer of the face (Schuppel), but the ordinary
communication of the new formation is from primary cancer of the
stomach, intestine, pancreas, mesentery, etc.The cancer elements, as
the author has several times verified, crowd the lymphatics and veins,
and through these channels reach the liver and other parts.As the
cancer elements in the case of secondary implication of the liver are
distributed chiefly by the portal vein, it follows that there must be
numerous secondary foci and multiple nodes.Cancerous infiltration
under these circumstances is the rarest possible form for the new
growth to take.The size and number of nodes forming in these cases of
secondary implication of the organ vary greatly--from two or three to
twenty, or a hundred, or even more.As regards the form, structure, and
ultimate behavior of the secondary formation, they do not differ from
the primary.As respects the relative proportion of stroma and cellular
elements--fibres and cells--they vary greatly, some presenting the firm
texture of a predominating fibrous stroma, others the softness and
ready diffluence of the excessive cellular production.The latter is
undoubtedly the usual condition, and when the nodular masses are
incised an abundant creamy juice exudes.With the development of these
nodules an increase in the size of the liver takes place and the organ
has an uneven and indurated feel.As the cancerous masses develop the
proper hepatic structure undergoes atrophy, and finally little is left
of the organ but the cancerous new formation.The blood-vessels,
lymphatics, and peritoneal investment are invaded, the first mentioned
most decidedly; and especially are organized exudations the favorite
seats of cancer new formations, those, for example, about the
gall-bladder and cystic duct resulting from repeated attacks of passage
of calculi.{1036} Secondary changes take place in the cancerous nodes.As the
cells develop pressure is brought to bear on the vessels supplying them
and on each other, with the result of fatty degeneration of the central
portion, which effects the change in the form of the nodules and in
their consistence, already mentioned.The blood-supply to the cancerous
nodes in the liver is derived from the hepatic artery, as Frerichs has
determined by carefully-made injections; they also are new formations
of exceedingly delicate structure, and form a network about the
periphery of each mass or node.By reference to these anatomical
considerations it is easy to understand the failure of nutrition of the
central portions of the nodes.Pigment cancers of the liver are rare as secondary formations, and
excessively infrequent as primary formations.They are, properly
speaking, melano-sarcomas (Schuppel).They are more often metastatic
than merely secondary--that is, transferred from different parts, as in
the case of melanotic sarcoma of the choroid--than due to neighboring
disease transferred by contiguity of tissue.This variety of cancer, so
called, takes the form of multiple nodes or of diffused infiltration,
the former more frequently; but both modes of development may go on at
the same time.The nodes vary in size from a pea to a child's head,
have a grayish, brownish, or blackish tint, and exude on section a
fluid not creamy like true cancer-juice, but rather watery and
containing black particles floating in it.In the case of diffuse
infiltration the pigment masses are thoroughly distributed through the
original hepatic tissue.In both forms the size and weight of the organ
are enormously increased.In the case of the melanotic infiltration the
whole organ is uniformly enlarged, reaching in a few months the
enormous size of twelve to twenty pounds.Sarcomas also occur very rarely as primary growths in the liver, but
secondary sarcomas are more frequent.There are fibro-sarcoma,
lympho-sarcoma, and osteo-sarcoma as secondary deposits, the first
being very firm in consistence, the second soft and medullary, and the
last of hard, bony consistence.SYMPTOMS.--We are especially concerned here with primary cancer of the
liver.The secondary disease is so obscured by the main and primary
lesion that a diagnosis may be impossible.Furthermore, the progress of
the original disease is that which demands immediate consideration.As,
therefore, the secondary implication of the liver is of relatively
trifling importance, and only an incident in the course of the main
disease, the matter for consideration now is primary cancer of the
liver.It is the fact that in some, even a considerable proportion, of the
cases the onset and progress of cancer of the liver are very obscure.For some time the symptoms may be of the vaguest description.The usual
history is this: A person of forty to sixty years begins to fail in
flesh and strength, becomes sallow, has disorders of digestion, pain
and uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, and the bowels are now
confined, now relaxed.The abdomen, notwithstanding the general loss of
flesh, increases in size, and the superficial veins are enlarged; very
considerable pain is experienced in the right hypochondrium, and often
extreme tenderness to pressure is a pronounced symptom.The pains are
not limited to the hepatic region, out extend widely from this point in
all directions.On palpation the {1037} liver is found to be enlarged,
its texture indurated, and its outline irregular and nodular, and
pain--often, indeed, quite severe--is developed by pressure.The condition of the liver on palpation is best ascertained by suddenly
depressing the abdominal wall with the tips of the fingers arranged in
a line.Displacing thus the movable bodies in the cavity, the liver is
quickly reached, and nodules, if they exist, are readily felt.If the
new formation has developed from exudations about the gall-bladder and
cystic duct, it may be felt by suddenly depressing the walls of the
abdomen over this organ in the usual position of the fissure.In the case of general cancerous infiltration of the organ, with the
remarkable enlargement which occurs in such cases, there will be
present an obvious distension of the right hypochondrium; the
intercostal spaces will be forced outward and the arches of the ribs
rendered more prominent; the area of hepatic dulness, both vertical and
transverse, will be increased; and the limits of dulness will move with
a full inspiration downward, and with a full expiration upward.This
mobility of cancer-nodules of the liver with the inspiratory and
expiratory changes serves to distinguish them from tumors of the
abdominal walls.Seen early, the changes in the size of a nodule or of
the liver itself may be noted from week to week,[143] especially in
cases of rapidly-growing cancer.[Footnote 143: Murchison, _Clinical Lectures_, p.As the cancerous new formations extend into the portal system within
the liver, obstruction to the portal circulation results from the
blocking of the blood-current.Also, interference in the portal
circulation arises by compression of the vessels from without, either
through the accumulation of cancer-products in the liver or by the
enlargement of the lymphatics in the fissure of the organ.In what way
soever it may be produced, the practical fact remains that ascites is a
frequent symptom, occurring in somewhat more than one-half of the
cases.It may be a clear serum
containing a small proportion of albumen; it may be  by bile or
be of a deeper greenish or reddish hue; it may contain flocculi of
lymph and numerous leucocytes floating in it; and the ordinary serum
may be rendered cloudy and be filled with shreds of exudation in
consequence of peritonitis, or bloody because of hemorrhage from a
softening nodule.When the fluid is considerable in amount the
difficulty of ascertaining the condition of the liver is greatly
enhanced, and symptoms due to the interference of the fluid with the
action of various organs are introduced into the complexus of morbid
signs.Especially is the upward pressure of the ascitic fluid, and the
consequent interference in the movements of the lungs and heart, a
source of considerable distress.First, a local and afterward a general
peritonitis ensues as a consequence of the extension outwardly of the
new formations to the peritoneal layer, and its implication by
contiguity of tissue or the rupture of a spreading fungous growth and
hemorrhagic extravasation into the cavity.The peritoneal complication
is not only a serious addition to the sufferings experienced by the
patient, but it adds to the difficulties of a diagnosis.In the case of
a celebrated savant who died of cancer of the liver (seen by the
writer) there was such a pronounced peritonitis that the diagnosis made
by the attending physician was chronic peritonitis.When this
complication occurs, there takes place {1038} a decided increase in the
local tenderness, and this increased sensibility to pressure quickly
extends over the abdomen, causing a general exquisite tenderness.Besides this tenderness characteristic of most cases of peritonitis,
distension of the abdomen and the decubitus peculiar to this state are
obvious symptoms.It is therefore clear that the occurrence of
peritonitis not only contributes to the severity and painfulness of the
case, but seriously complicates the diagnosis.It has been already stated that pain in the right hypochondrium is a
nearly constant symptom in cancer of the liver.With the initial
symptoms, uneasiness, heaviness, a sense of pressure in the hepatic
region are experienced, and as the case progresses more or less acute
pain develops as a rule.In cases of cancer
involving the deeper portion of the liver there may be little pain, and
in some rare cases of cancer involving the external part of the
liver--the capsule and peritoneum--but little pain is experienced.In
much the largest proportion of cases the pain is severe, and the
production of any considerable pain means the implication of the
hepatic plexus of nerves or the hepatic peritoneum.It follows, then,
that the pain in the former case is not limited to the locality of the
disease, but is more or less widely distributed through the anatomical
relations of the hepatic plexus, being felt in the epigastrium, the
walls of the chest, the shoulders, etc.In secondary cancer of the liver, following cancer of the stomach,
vomiting is a constant symptom, but also in those cases of primary
disease in which the left lobe is especially enlarged, relatively, are
nausea and vomiting pronounced symptoms.At the onset of the malady the
appetite fails and a gastro-intestinal catarrh is set up.More or less
catarrh of the bile-ducts also ensues.The interference with nutrition
thus occasioned is enhanced in those cases in which the obstruction of
the ducts is sufficient to prevent the escape of bile into the
intestine.Jaundice is not a constant symptom, occurring in little more
than one-third of the cases.When it occurs, the peculiar stools are
present and the intestinal digestion is deranged, as in cases of
ordinary obstruction to the ducts.In two cases of cancer of the liver
occurring in the writer's practice, and examined by post-mortem, there
were calculi present in the gall-bladder; in one case the principal
calculus was egg-shaped and the size of a pullet's egg.The nutrition rapidly fails from the beginning of cancer of the liver.The downward pace is accelerated when the gastro-intestinal digestion
fails and vomiting occurs after taking food.The skin becomes dry and
wrinkled, and if not jaundiced has a peculiar tint, varying in depth of
color from an earthy or fawn-like hue to a deep bronze.Failure of
strength is a pronounced symptom from the beginning, and is out of
proportion to the loss of flesh.As the wasting advances the decline of
strength is accounted for, but the feeling of weakness and the distaste
for exertion which occur so early are very significant signs of
internal cancer, although they do not indicate the position of the
neoplasm.The urine declines in amount as the case progresses.It is usually very
high-, contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, and other
forms of pigment produced by conditions not at present known.Sometimes
albumen is present, and leucin and tyrosin rarely.{1039} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As has been already set
forth, cancer of the liver may present so few really distinctive
symptoms as to escape recognition.Under favorable circumstances the
diagnosis may be comparatively easy.In forming an opinion it is useful
to review the whole course of the malady and draw conclusions not only
from the characteristic signs, but from the development of the symptoms
as a whole.A case of cancer of the liver occurs usually after the middle period of
life.The person so affected begins to decline in flesh and strength,
has uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, disorders of digestion, and
begins to have a pallid or earthy hue of the countenance.Presently,
much pain is felt in the hepatic region, the organ distinctly enlarges,
and some effusion of fluid and much flatus increase the dimensions of
the abdomen.Much tenderness, often exquisite sensibility, is produced
by pressure over the liver, and often over the whole abdomen.By
careful palpation nodules can be made out and their growth noted in
those cases free from peritoneal inflammation.The abdominal swelling
and tenderness incommodes the lungs, and a semi-erect decubitus is
assumed to relieve the pressure on them; the breathing becomes short,
catching, hurried, and painful, and sometimes a most distressing
hiccough is superadded to the other sufferings.Jaundice appears, or the earthy hue of the skin deepens
into a bronze discoloration.The case may be terminated by some
intercurrent disease--by an attack of pleuritis, pneumonia, by
peritonitis from rupture or perforation, by intra-peritoneal
hemorrhage, by an exhausting diarrhoea.The natural termination is by
gradual failure of the powers, by marasmus, the immediate cause of
death being due to cerebral anaemia, to failure of the heart from fatty
degeneration of the cardiac muscle, from thrombosis of the portal vein,
from the development of a hemorrhagic state, and hemorrhages from the
various mucous surfaces, etc.The duration is much influenced also by
the character of the cancer, whether scirrhous or medullary.The latter
are not only more rapidly growing, more destructive of the hepatic
tissue, and more rapidly distributed to neighboring organs, but more
quickly perforate the capsule and excite a fatal result by hemorrhage
or by peritonitis.The average duration of cancer of the liver is
variously stated.Having reference to my own personal observation,
controlled by the experience of other observers, the duration is from
three to nine months, one year being exceptional.There are cases in
which the symptoms are very acute, the progress rapid, the whole course
from the initial symptoms to the termination being completed in from
two to three months.It need hardly be observed that no case of cancer
of the liver has been cured.If
any case has seemed to be cured, it may be asserted with confidence
that cancer of the liver did not exist.DIAGNOSIS.--The differential diagnosis is concerned, first, with the
existence of cancer; second, with its form.As cancer causes
enlargement of the liver in two textural conditions--namely, uniformly
smooth, and nodular--it must be differentiated from other diseases
producing similar results.Amyloid disease and echinococcus cysts
present us types of the former; cirrhosis and syphilis, of the latter.The history of the amyloid disease and of the echinococcus cyst is very
different, and both {1040} develop much more slowly.Amyloid disease of
the liver arises simultaneously with the same form of degeneration in
other organs, and is connected with suppurative disease of some kind,
with syphilis, with chronic malarial poisoning, etc., and may occur at
any age.Echinococcus cysts enlarge painlessly and do not impair the
vital forces; the liver is elastic, and under favorable circumstances
presents by palpation the purring-tremor symptom.Cirrhosis may have to
be differentiated at two periods--during the time of enlargement,
which, however, is rather brief; and during the stage of contraction
and nodulation.The history in cancer and in cirrhosis is different:
the age, the habits of life, the rate of hepatic change, are opposed in
the two diseases; the diminution in size with nodulation is
characteristic of cirrhosis; enlargement with nodulation belongs to
cancer.The rapid progress of cancer, the wasting, the debility, the
cachexia, serve to distinguish it from all other affections of the
liver except acute yellow atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning; both,
however, are so different in history and development as not to require
differentiation.It may be quite impossible in latent cases to
distinguish primary cancer of the liver from secondary, but in those
examples of the disease occurring in the stomach, intestines, and
pancreas there is usually an antecedent history of the primary malady
which distinctly separates it in point of time and the character of the
symptoms from the secondary implication of the liver.Cancer of the
gall-bladder, and especially of the organized exudation about it, may
not be readily separated from cancer of the pancreas or of the
duodenum.In doubtful cases the history of attacks of hepatic colic
becomes an important element in making the differentiation.TREATMENT.--As we are not in possession of a cure for cancer, the
treatment of cancer of the liver must be palliative.Anodynes to
relieve pain, paracentesis of the abdomen to remove accumulation of
fluid which causes distress, carbolic acid to check nausea and
vomiting, and the usual haemostatics for hemorrhage, are the measures
most necessary.In fact, the treatment must be throughout
symptomatic--for the relief of symptoms as they arise.DEFINITION.--By amyloid liver is meant a deposit in the cells of the
organ, in its vessels and interstitial tissue, of a peculiar albuminoid
matter called amyloid because of a superficial resemblance to
starch-granules.Various designations have been applied to this
condition of the organ; thus it has been entitled waxy liver and
lardaceous liver, because of the apparent resemblance to wax and lard
respectively.CAUSES.--There exists in the blood a peculiar material, albuminoid in
form, applied in the normal state to the structure of
tissue--dystropodextrin, as it is called by Seegen--which, when
precipitated under certain conditions not now known, assumes the
peculiar appearance with which we are now familiar under the term
amyloid.The character of the amyloid matter was first distinctly set
forth in 1858 by Virchow, who also discovered the characteristic
reaction by which it can always be detected.The reaction to iodine
gave to the material the designation amyloid, or starch-like, by which
it is chiefly known.The {1041} circumstances inducing the deposit of
this material are by no means clearly understood.It has long been
known that suppuration, especially in connection with bone, has had a
distinct influence.Syphilis, especially the tertiary lesions
accompanied by pus-formation, has an evident causative relation.Chronic malarial infection has a more distant and doubtful, but still
recognized, power to develop this morbid state.Of the various causes
above mentioned, the most frequent is the suppuration of pulmonary
cavities.In regard to the influence of this, however, it must be
remembered that no form of suppurative disease is so common.The
relative frequency of the association between suppurating cavities and
amyloid disease is not greater than long-standing necrosis with an
extensive sequestrum is with the same state; but the actual number of
the former is greater.Amyloid disease of the liver is most frequent
between the ages of ten and thirty, but it may occur at any age, the
period in life being determined by the operation of the causes.Thus,
Frerichs' statistics are: under ten there were 3 cases, from ten to
twenty there were 19, and from twenty to fifty there were 37 cases.Men
are, relatively to sex, more frequently attacked, and in the proportion
of three-fourths, but this difference means, of course, the character
of men's occupations and their greater liability thereby to the
accidents and diseases incident to such employments.Besides the pathogenetic factors above mentioned, it may be well to
refer in this connection to the effect of long-standing neoplasms.It
has been found that amyloid disease is produced in some subjects by the
cachexia resulting from the slow development and persistence of such a
new formation.The special character of the neoplasm is of less
importance in respect to this condition than the constitutional
condition--the cachexia--induced by its slow growth and interference
with nutrition.Although long-standing disease, especially of a
suppurative kind, is known to be necessary to cause amyloid disease,
Cohnheim[144] has lately published some facts which seem to prove that
the degeneration may occur more speedily than has been heretofore
supposed.He has shown, contrary to the previously-accepted view, that
amyloid degeneration may follow in three months after the reception of
a gunshot wound.He records three cases in which the amyloid deposits
ensued in six, five, and three months, respectively.[Footnote 144: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.271 _et seq._, "Zur
Kentniss der Amyloidentartung."]According to the author's observation, a peculiar somatic type is
either necessary to, or at least is greatly promotive of, the amyloid
degeneration.If, for example, the same suppurative process occurs in a
person of a blond and lymphatic type and in another of brunette and
nervo-muscular type, the former will be much more likely to suffer from
amyloid change than the latter."The gelatinous progeny of albuminous
parents" is the mode of expression used to designate this particular
type.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--To use the term amyloid liver is rather
misleading, since this indicates the restriction of the morbid process
to the liver, whereas it is perfectly well known to be rather widely
distributed through various organs and tissues of the body.The term
amyloid is itself confusing, since the albuminoid material so
designated is not really starch-like.The corpora amylacea, so called,
differ materially from starch-granules, and still more from the amyloid
matter.According to {1042} Wagner,[145] these substances "have nothing
in common."In the study of the amyloid deposit it has not been
possible to separate it from the tissue in which it is imbedded; hence
the published analyses of this peculiar material are probably far from
correct.However, it has been rendered probable that the amyloid
deposit has close affinities with fibrin.One of the theories--that of
Dickinson of London--assumes that this material is fibrin deprived of
the potash associated intimately with it.According to Seegen,
dystropodextrin, a material existing in normal blood, agrees with
amyloid matter in its most essential characteristics.Although
Dickinson's theory is not tenable, it has served a useful purpose in
showing the close affinity of fibrin with this pathological product.What view soever may be entertained of its nature, it is certain that
the material to which we apply the term amyloid is of albuminous
origin.Under circumstances with which we are now unacquainted this
material is deposited from the vessels, and, instead of undergoing
organization and contributing to the structure of tissues, remains
unorganized and unappropriated.It is known that this deposition of the
amyloid material is related to the process of suppuration and to
certain cachexiae, but the intermediate steps remain unknown and
inexplicable.[Footnote 145: _A Manual of General Pathology_, by Prof.325 _et seq._]

The amyloid matter is first exuded into the coats of the finest
ramifications of the hepatic artery, and therefore the first appearance
of the disease is in the middle zone of the lobules.In this respect
pathologists are agreed: that the amyloid deposits first appear in the
walls of the vessels.Wagner maintained, in opposition to Virchow, that
the exudation is limited to the vessels and does not extend to the
hepatic cells, which perish by pressure and consequent atrophy.It seems most probable, however, that
the ramifications of the hepatic artery and all the capillaries of the
lobule are affected, and that the deposits in them lead to atrophic
degeneration of the cells.In consequence of this extensive implication of the vascular system of
the liver important changes occur in the size, density, and appearance
of the liver.The organ is greatly enlarged in all its diameters.When
felt through the walls of the abdomen its outline is distinct, it is
firm, even hard, to the sense of touch, and it projects from a finger's
breadth to a hand's breadth below the margin of the ribs.The increase
of size of the amyloid liver is very great, attaining in weight, on the
average, twice that of the normal organ; but this size may be largely
exceeded in exceptional instances.In respect to shape and outline the
amyloid liver does not differ from the normal organ; for although its
dimensions are increased, its relations to the parts adjacent are not
altered.The weight of the amyloid liver may reach ten, twelve, even
sixteen pounds avoirdupois.The color of the amyloid liver is very
different from that of the normal organ: instead of having the
reddish-brown tint, it becomes grayish, yellowish, or reddish-gray.In
consistence the amyloid liver is firm and rather elastic and doughy,
and on section the margins of the incision are well defined, even
sharp.A very characteristic feature of the cut surface is its
paleness, anaemia, or bloodlessness, and scarcely any blood is exuded,
even from the large vessels.The appearance of the incised surface of
the liver has been described by comparison with various substances:
according to one, it is waxy; according to another, it is lardaceous.A
thin {1043} section of a part of the liver far advanced in the amyloid
change is distinctly translucent, almost transparent; but a marked
difference is observable between the amyloid matter and the lobules
proper, even in the cases of extreme deposit.The lobules are separated
by an opaque yellow border, and the centre of each is marked by a spot
of a similar yellow color.The amyloid material is remarkable for its power to resist the action
of chemical agents and putrefactive decomposition.The test originally
proposed by Virchow--iodine--continues to be the most characteristic.Orth[146] suggests a method of applying it which is very excellent in
respect to the clearness with which the reaction is shown: A large,
thin section of the affected liver is placed in a saucer of water
containing some iodine, and after the reaction has taken place is laid
on a white plate.Iodine tincture, diluted or the compound solution, is
brushed over the affected region, when the amyloid matter assumes a
deep mahogany tint and the normal tissues a merely yellowish hue.The
distinctness of the reaction may be increased by brushing over the
iodized surface some dilute sulphuric acid, when the amyloid matter
takes a deep violet, almost black, color.[Footnote 146: _Diagnosis in Pathological Anatomy_, Riverside Press,
1878, p.Only a part of the organ--namely, the smaller vessels--may be involved
in the degeneration, and this may be restricted to patches or parts of
the organ.With the amyloid change there may be associated syphilitic
gummata, or the liver may be more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration or in cirrhosis.Those parts of the organ not invaded by
the disease are not often entirely normal; they are more or less
darkened in color by venous congestion, distinctly softer, etc.The
amyloid change is not limited to the liver, but extends to the kidneys,
lymphatic glands, the intestinal mucous membrane, etc.SYMPTOMS.--As the amyloid change in the liver is usually coincident
with a simultaneous alteration of other organs, and as the deposits
characteristic of the affection are dependent on long-previous disease
of an exhausting kind, it is not surprising that the subjects of this
affection present the evidences of a cachexia.To the effects of a
chronic malady we have added the complications growing out of the
amyloid change in the liver, associated, as it usually is, with amyloid
degeneration of other important organs.The symptomatic expression of amyloid liver is therefore mixed up with
various derangements that occur simultaneously, but especially with the
causes inducing the existing cachexia, with chronic suppuration of
pulmonary cavities, or in connection with diseased bone, with the
syphilitic cachexia, or with chronic malarial toxaemia.With what cause
soever the cachexia may be associated, the symptomatology of amyloid
liver is secondary to, or ingrafted on, the conditions produced by the
cachexia.The liver is enlarged in all well-marked cases from a
finger's breadth to a hand's breadth or more below the inferior margin
of the ribs; it is also firm to the touch, well defined, elastic, and
its margin rounded, but yet well defined.There is usually no
tenderness nor pain, and, without any uneasy sensations to indicate the
change taking place, the organ is found to have slowly enlarged,
sometimes to an extraordinary extent.Careful palpation may also
demonstrate an enlargement of the spleen.When the abdominal muscles
are relaxed and there is no swelling of the abdomen by flatus or
peritoneal effusion, the very considerable enlargement of {1044} the
liver can be readily ascertained.If the effusion is not so great as to
distend the abdomen unduly, the increased consistence and dimensions of
the liver can still be made out with comparative ease.The hepatic
functions are not always sufficiently disturbed to produce
characteristic symptoms.In a small proportion--scarcely one-tenth--of
the cases does jaundice appear, and when present it is due, usually, to
enlargement of the lymphatics in the hilus of the organ, and thus
directly compressing the hepatic duct.In the writer's experience,
although jaundice has not occurred, there was present a peculiar dark
earthy or bronzed tint of the skin, significant of chronic hepatic
troubles.Obstruction of the portal circulation is rather unusual, and
the explanation is to be found in the fact that the amyloid
degeneration occurs first in the radicles of the hepatic artery.In
about one-fourth of the cases ascites is present, but in a somewhat
larger proportion hemorrhoids, blackish, tarry stools, and other
evidences of portal congestion.When the intestinal arterioles are
attacked, an intractable colliquative diarrhoea comes on; the stools
are offensive, sometimes light from the absence of bile, sometimes dark
from decomposition or the presence of blood.When the stomach
arterioles are also involved, which is usual under these circumstances,
the blandest and simplest articles of diet will pass unchanged or
simply decomposed.Blood may be vomited sometimes in large quantity
from thrombic ulcers, but the matter ejected from the stomach when the
case is well advanced is a thin, watery fluid, faintly acid or neutral,
and greenish or brownish in color.An enlarged spleen is often present, produced by the same
conditions--by amyloid degeneration.The same change taking place in
the kidney, the urine becomes pale, abundant, of low specific gravity,
and albuminous.General dropsy supervenes in a majority of the cases
finally, due largely to the hydraemia; and of this condition ascites is
a part.In some cases enlargement of the abdomen is the first step in
the dropsical effusion, and may throughout be the most prominent, as
the author has seen.In other cases oedema of the feet and legs is the
first evidence of dropsy; in still others the dropsy is general from
the beginning.Amyloid liver may coexist with a fairly good state of the bodily
nutrition, but if digestion and assimilation be interfered with by any
of the causes above mentioned, the strength rapidly declines and
emaciation reaches an extreme degree.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As amyloid liver is never a
substantive affection, but secondary to some constitutional malady or
to long-continued suppuration, its course must be considered in
relation to the agency producing it.It is very silent in its origin
and progress, and causes no pronounced symptoms until it attains
considerable size and its functions are interfered with by the extent
of the deposits.The history of the affection to which it is secondary
therefore precedes the onset of the amyloid change and accompanies it
throughout.The enlarged organ, with the results of its enlargement in
altered functions of the abdominal organs, is a symptom superadded to
existing disturbances.The period elapsing in the course of a chronic
suppurative disease before the amyloid change occurs differs greatly in
different cases, and may be stated as from three months (Cohnheim's
case) to many years.Many of the cases terminate by an intercurrent
disease; others by uraemic {1045} convulsions; a very few by hemorrhage
from the stomach or intestines; and those pursuing their course
uninterruptedly, by exhaustion.By some a cure at the beginning of
the morbid deposits is regarded as possible, and examples of cures have
been reported.The writer has seen supposed cases of amyloid liver
terminate in recovery.There must always remain an impression that in
such instances an error of diagnosis was committed.Those of syphilitic
origin are probably more curable, but syphiloma of the liver may be
confounded with amyloid disease, and hence the cure may be referred to
the latter.DIAGNOSIS.--Amyloid degeneration of the liver may be confounded with
the various non-febrile enlargements of the organ.An important element
in making the differentiation is the history of suppuration in
connection with bone, with lung cavities, with constitutional syphilis,
with chronic malarial toxaemia, etc.From fatty liver, amyloid
degeneration is distinguished by the history as just sketched; by the
fatty tendencies of the body in the former, emaciation in the latter;
by the concomitant changes in the spleen, kidneys, and elsewhere; and
by the subsequent history, fatty liver terminating by a weak heart
usually, whilst the amyloid disease ends in the modes described in the
preceding paragraph.From hydatid disease, amyloid liver is
differentiated by the history, by the difference in the physical
characteristics of the enlargement, by the presence of the purring
tremor in the one, its absence in the other, and especially by the
subsequent course.In all doubtful cases the use of an aspirator-needle
and the withdrawal of some fluid containing the characteristic hooklets
of the echinococcus will serve to determine the nature of the growth.From cancer, amyloid liver is separated by the previous history, by the
nodular character of the enlargement, by the pain, and by the cachexia
and associated derangements.Whilst amyloid liver is secondary to
suppurative diseases, cancer is usually secondary to cancer of the
stomach or other organ within the limits of the portal circulation.TREATMENT.--As amyloid disease owes its origin to syphilis, to chronic
malarial toxaemia, to suppuration, these, so far as they are remediable
conditions, should be cured as speedily as may be, to prevent the
development of the amyloid disease or to arrest it if begun.Unfortunately, the condition of the liver is not recognized until the
morbid change is effected, and therefore practically irremediable.The treatment necessarily involves that of the morbid state to which
the amyloid deposits are owing.The syphilitic disease requires iodine
and mercury; the malarial, quinine, iodine and the iodides, eucalyptus,
iron, etc., according to the state of each case; and surgical diseases,
especially necrosis of bone, should be effectively treated by suitable
surgical expedients.The cause being removed if possible, what means,
if any, can be resorted to to cause the absorption of the amyloid
matter?The only specific plan of treatment hitherto proposed is that
of Dickinson,[147] based on his theory of the constitution of amyloid
matter; according to which the amyloid deposits consist of fibrin
altered by the separation of the potash and soda salts, which have been
eliminated in the pus.If this theory be admitted, the obvious
indication is to supply the alkaline materials.The cases reported by
Dickinson in which this theory was {1046} practically demonstrated were
not sufficiently improved to lend any empirical support to this method.[Footnote 147: _The Pathology and Treatment of Albuminuria_, p.214 _et
seq._]

The medicinal remedies which do any good are the iodides--notably the
iodides of ammonium, of iron, of manganese, etc., the compound solution
of iodine, and the double iodide of iron and manganese.As the
officinal ointment of the red iodide of mercury, rubbed in over the
splenic region, does so much good in chronic enlargement of the spleen,
it is probable that it will prove effective in this form of enlargement
of the liver.The writer has observed results from it in such cases
that justify him in strongly urging its employment.The method of its
application consists in rubbing perseveringly a piece of the ointment,
a large pea in size, over the whole hepatic area, and repeating it
daily until some irritation and desquamation of the skin is produced,
when it should be suspended until the parts will bear renewed
applications.Besides the topical application of the red iodide, this
remedy may be given internally with advantage without reference to
syphilitic infection.It seems to the writer probable that bichloride
of mercury may be as useful, as it is certainly more manageable.The
chloride of gold and sodium, arsenic in small doses, and the metallic
tonics, so called, may be useful carefully administered, especially the
first mentioned, which the writer believes has some real power over the
disease.As the hepatic functions are
much disturbed, if not entirely suspended, it is necessary to give
those foods which are converted into peptones in the stomach.As a
rule, fats, starches, and sweets are mischievous, and milk, meats,
oysters, and the nitrogenous foods best adapted to nourish the patient.If the diarrhoea should prove exhausting, the mineral acids, with
opium, are the best remedies.Nausea and vomiting are best relieved by
carbolic acid mixture, and hemorrhages by the solution of the chloride
or subsulphate of iron.Fatty Liver; Fatty Degeneration of the Liver (Hepar Adiposum).DEFINITION.--By the term fatty liver is meant a change in the organ
characterized by the excessive quantity of fat- or oil-globules
contained in the cells of the parenchyma.CAUSES.--The liver acts, under normal conditions, as a reservoir for
the surplus fat, which it gives out as the demand is made.It is not
only the fat brought to the liver by the blood which accumulates in the
organ, but it apparently possesses the power to transform certain
substances--albumen, for example--into fat.An important causative
element, therefore, is the quantity of fat present in the food
habitually consumed.This has been proved by the investigations of
Radziejewsky[148] and others, who have shown that the fat in the food
is stored up in the normal places of deposit, one of which, of course,
is the liver.Another causative element is the formation of fat from
the albumen of the hepatic cells in consequence of diminished
oxidation.In respect to both causes the consumption of oxygen is an
important factor.The insufficient supply of oxygen {1047} which is a
necessary result of a sedentary life leads thus, directly, to the
accumulation of fat in the liver-cells.A constitutional predisposition
is also an important factor.There are those who under certain
conditions of daily life store up large supplies of fat, and others who
under the same conditions continue lean.Women more than men are
subject to such inherited predispositions.[Footnote 148: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.Again, fatty liver occurs in the course of certain cachexiae, notably
phthisis.In this case the obstructive pulmonary lesions interfere with
the process of oxidation, and also maintain a constant hyperaemia of
the portal system.This condition of the liver also occurs in the
cancerous cachexia, in anaemia and chlorosis of long standing, in
chronic suppurative diseases, etc.The dyscrasia of chronic alcoholism
is a very common cause of fatty liver.At the same time that
hyperplasia of the connective tissue is taking place the fat is
accumulating in the hepatic cells.So great is the accumulation of fat
in the blood that the serum presents a milky appearance.This excess in
the quantity of fat is rather due to diminished oxidation, to lessened
combustion, than to increased production.Another causative element of
the fat-production in cases of alcoholism is the interference of
alcohol with the process of digestion and assimilation.Poisoning by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other metals sets up an
acute fatty degeneration of the liver.Pregnancy, lactation, and
suppuration also have the same effect, but to a slighter and less
permanent extent.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Fatty liver agrees with amyloid liver in that
the fatty deposits increase the size and weight of the organ.The
surface is smooth, the peritoneal investment unaltered, and the margins
rounded.Sometimes the organ is merely increased in thickness,
sometimes in diameter.It has a greasy feel and cuts like a mass of
fatty tissue.Examined at a low temperature--below freezing--it seems
like a mass of suet, the proper structure being almost extinguished in
the fatty metamorphosis.The outline of the lobules remains distinct
even in cases far advanced in the fatty degeneration, but in the
extreme cases it is obliterated, the cut surface presenting a uniformly
yellowish or grayish-yellow tint.The fatty liver is also wanting in
blood; it is dry, and on section only the largest vessels contain any
blood.When cardiac disease of a kind to produce congestion of the
venous system exists--for example, mitral or tricuspid lesions--the
same relative decrease in the quantity of blood in the liver is
observable after death, although during the life of the subject the
opposite condition may have been present.The cause of this
bloodlessness of the fatty liver is to be sought in the pressure
exerted by the growing fat-cells.Not all cases of fatty liver are advanced to the degree indicated in
the above description.From the normal size up to the maximum attained
by the most advanced fatty liver there are numerous gradations in the
quantity of fat and in the dimensions of the organ.Fatty degeneration
may accompany cirrhosis, in which the liver is contracted.The deposits
of fat may take place in particular areas.In cases of fatty liver per
se the deposit occurs within the liver-cells, as may be demonstrated on
microscopic examination, the initial change consisting in the formation
of granules in the protoplasm which ultimately coalesce, thus producing
{1048} fat-globules or cells.The fatty change in the hepatic cells
proceeds in a certain methodical manner from the cells at the periphery
of each lobule to the centre.The quantity of fat deposited in the
liver in cases of fatty change is very great.In the normal condition
of the organ fat exists, according to Perls,[149] in the proportion of
3 per cent.When the condition of fatty
liver exists the quantity of fat rises to 40, even 45, per
cent.--almost one-half.It is important to note, as was pointed out by
Frerichs, that in an inverse ratio with the increase of fat was the
quantity of water.[Footnote 149: _Virchow's Archiv_, _supra_.]That more or less fatty change in the liver is not incompatible with a
normal functional activity is quite certain, but the boundary between
health and disease is by no means well defined in respect to the
quantity of fatty change in the liver-cells.The liver, within certain
limits, is a mere reservoir of the surplus fat of the body, and hence a
variable, but not excessive, amount of accumulation of fat is not
incompatible with a normal functional performance of the organ.The
limits of a merely functional state and of a diseased state are not,
therefore, very clearly defined.In certain inferior animals, as
Frerichs has shown, a fatty condition of the liver is normal.SYMPTOMS.--The signs and symptoms of fatty liver are by no means well
defined.This state of the organ, as a rule, accompanies the general
tendency to fatty metamorphosis and deposit in the body.It is a
symptom in the course of phthisis, of chronic alcoholism, and of
various forms of metallic poisoning, but under these circumstances
there is no material change in the course of the symptoms produced by
this complication.As an independent affection it rarely, if ever,
exists alone.So far as its symptoms can be defined, they are referable
to the organs of digestion and assimilation and to the liver itself.The appetite is generally good, but distress after eating, acidity and
heartburn, eructations of acid liquid and of certain articles of diet,
are experienced.The stools are usually rather soft or liquid, wanting
in color, whitish or pasty, and occasionally dark, almost black, owing
to the presence of blood.The
discharges are often offensive from the decomposition of certain
constituents of the food, acid and burning because of the presence of
acetic, butyric, and other fat acids, or merely offensive because of
the formation of hydrogen compounds with sulphur and phosphorus.Notwithstanding the derangement of the stomachal and intestinal
digestion, the deposition of fat continues in an abnormal ratio.With
the increase in body-weight a decline in muscular power takes place.The respiration is hurried on the slightest exertion, and dyspnoea is
produced by any prolonged muscular effort.The circulation is feeble
and the pulse slow in the state of repose, but on active exertion the
pulse becomes rapid and at the same time feeble.The sleep is disturbed
by horrifying dreams, and only on assuming a nearly sitting posture can
the patient sleep with any degree of quietude.In these cases of fatty liver a very considerable mental inquietude,
despondency, even hypochondria and melancholia, result.The relation of
insufficient hepatic excretion to the mental state is yet sub judice,
but there can be no doubt that some connection exists.From the
earliest {1049} period hepatic derangements--as the term hypochondria
denotes--have been associated with certain disorders of the mind.This
relation certainly holds good in respect to the mental perturbation
occurring in cases of fatty liver.With a rotund countenance and a
well-nourished body there is associated very considerable mental
despondency.Without distinct jaundice the skin has an earthen or tallow-like hue,
the conjunctiva is muddy or distinctly yellow, and now and then
well-defined jaundice appears.The urine is rather scanty, high- because of the presence of
bile-pigments, and deposits urates abundantly.When jaundice
accompanies fatty liver the urine will be very dark, muddy, thick, and
will react to the usual tests for bile, urates, etc.The area of hepatic dulness is, as a rule, enlarged in cases of fatty
liver.The deposition of fat in the cells adds to the gross size of the
organ, and hence the inferior margin extends below the border of the
ribs to a degree determined by the amount of increase in its substance.If the liver can be felt, it is smooth, not hard and resisting, and is
free from nodules.Usually, however, owing to deposits of fat in the
omentum and in the abdominal walls, the outlines and condition of the
liver cannot be ascertained, and must remain merely conjectural.Rather, therefore, by implication than by direct examination can the
condition of the liver be ascertained.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of fatty liver, as an
element in a general change not of a toxic character, is essentially of
a chronic character.The fatty liver of acute phosphorus, antimonial,
and other forms of poisoning is acute and fatal, but it is not these
forms with which we are here concerned.Acting the part of a reservoir
of the surplus fat stored up in the body, which may be disposed of
under normal and physiological conditions, the fatty liver becomes by
careful management a normal organ again.The course, duration, and
termination will therefore largely depend on the nature of the
management pursued.A fatty liver cannot, then, be regarded as fatal,
or even as dangerous to life per se.The course and termination will
therefore be those of the associated condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the existence of fatty liver will not
be difficult in all those cases in which this condition may properly be
suspected; for example, in phthisis, in chronic alcoholismus, in
obesity, and in cases of habitual indulgence in eating and drinking.If
in these cases the organ is distinctly enlarged, is smooth, and is
flabby in outline; if at the same time the digestion is deranged, the
stools are light in color, there are hemorrhoids, flatulence, acid
indigestion, and torpid bowels,--a fatty liver may be reasonably
suspected.The subjects of fatty liver are usually obese, and present
the characteristics typical of that condition, or they are the victims
of alcoholismus or present the evidence of habitual indulgence in the
pleasures of the table.The differentiation of fatty liver from amyloid
degeneration, from cystic disease, and from other maladies causing
enlargement of the organ is made by reference to these points in the
etiological history--by a careful study of the condition of the organ
itself and of the organs associated with it in function.As the amyloid
liver is more likely to be confounded with the fatty liver, it should
be noted that the former is an outgrowth of the process of suppuration,
that the organ {1050} is hard in texture, and that amyloid change
occurs at the same time in other organs--conditions opposed to those
characteristic of the fatty liver.Cancer of the liver is accompanied
by a peculiar cachexia; the body wastes, and the enlarged liver is hard
and nodular instead of being smooth and flabby.TREATMENT.--When fatty liver is a symptom merely, its treatment is
merged into that of the primary condition.Thus, in phthisis and in the
various forms of metallic and phosphorus-poisoning the condition of the
liver is quite secondary.There are cases of obesity, however, in which
the fatty change in the liver is a part of the general morbid process,
and must be treated accordingly.There are still other cases in which,
without a decided tendency to obesity, the food habitually consumed is
of a fatty or fat-forming nature.The first requisite in the treatment
of fatty liver is to amend the diet.From the time of Hippocrates down
to Mr.Banting it has been recognized that the starchy and saccharine
constituents of the food, as well as the fatty, contribute to the
formation of fat.In arranging a dietary in cases of fatty liver this
fact should be regarded.Besides excluding the fats, saccharine and
starchy substances should be cut off.The diet should be composed of
fresh animal foods, game, fish, oysters, and such succulent vegetables
as lettuce, celery, spinach, raw cabbage (cole-slaw), etc.Amongst the
articles excluded should be bread, but the greatest difficulty is
experienced in its withdrawal, many patients declaring themselves
unable to live without it.In such instances a small biscuit
(water-cracker) may be allowed, but, as far as may be accomplished,
bread should be cut off from the diet.If there are acidity, heartburn, pyrosis, and regurgitation of acid
liquid, much good may be expected from the administration of diluted
nitric acid before meals, especially if there be considerable uric acid
in the urine.The simultaneous administration of tincture of nux vomica
will prove useful if the appetite is poor and the digestion feeble.When the complexion is muddy, the conjunctivae yellow, and the tongue
coated, excellent results are had from the persistent use of phosphate
of sodium.Even better results may be had from a combination of the two agents, a
teaspoonful of the pulverized phosphate being given with one-fortieth
of a grain of the arseniate of sodium.Alkalies, as lithium citrate,
solution of potassa, etc., are unquestionably useful as remedies for
obesity and fatty liver, but they must be administered with a proper
caution.Also, the permanganate of potassium has seemed to the author
to be especially valuable as a remedy for these states.Remedies to increase the activity of the portal circulation and
diminish congestion of the hepatic vessels are useful at the outset,
but the anaemia which succeeds renders their use improper at a later
period.Amongst the hepatic stimulants of great use in those cases
characterized by whitish, pasty stools, yellow conjunctivae, etc., are
resin of podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, and others having the same
powers.Saline laxatives are also useful, but to a less extent.It must
be remembered, however, that these subjects are wanting in bodily
vigor, often suffer from weak heart, and always have flabby muscles, so
that they bear all depleting measures badly.The hepatic stimulant of
greatest utility in these cases is sulphate of manganese.The writer
has had excellent results from a {1051} combination of quinine and
manganese.For the general state, which denotes insufficient oxidation
according to the chemical pathologists, permanganate of potassium is a
remedy of value, as above mentioned.The best form in which to
administer this is the compressed tablet, and the dose usually is two
grains.As chalybeate tonics are indicated, the oxidizing power of the
succinate of the ferric peroxide, the remedy so warmly advocated by
Buckler, may be utilized with advantage.The combination of quinine,
iron, and manganese in pill form, or the syrup of the iodides of iron
and manganese, or the phosphate of iron, quinine, and strychnine, are
tonics adapted to the relief of the depression accompanying this
malady.AFFECTIONS OF THE BILIARY PASSAGES.Catarrh of the Bile-Ducts.HISTORY AND DEFINITION.--Although catarrh of the bile-ducts had been
incidentally referred to by some previous writers, notably by Stokes of
Dublin, Virchow[150] was the first to treat of this condition
systematically.Amongst recent writers, Harley[151] appears to be the
only one disposed to question the importance of catarrh of the
bile-ducts as a factor in the production of jaundice.Even in
phosphorus-poisoning the appearance of jaundice, at one time supposed
to be haematogenic in source, has been referred to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.[152] It seems probable that opinions have too decidedly
veered toward the importance of this condition as a factor in the
production of jaundice.[Footnote 150: _Archiv fur path.117 _et seq._]

[Footnote 151: _Diseases of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 152: Wyss, _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1867, p.CAUSES.--Catarrh of the bile-ducts has been referred to all those
causes which can excite a catarrhal process in any situation.Amongst the systemic may be placed peculiarities of
constitution or idiosyncrasy.A tendency to hepatic disorders is a
feature in certain types of constitution, and, as such types are
transmitted, the hepatic disorders seem to be inherited.In such
persons, possessing the so-called bilious nature, catarrh of the
biliary passages is not uncommon, and a special susceptibility to it
apparently exists.The atmospherical and other causes which in some
subjects will set up a catarrh of the bronchi will in the bilious type
induce a catarrh of the duodenum and bile-ducts.The malady is not
inherited; only the character of bodily structure which favors it under
the necessary conditions.Climatic changes and certain seasons, especially the autumn, are
influential causes.Exposure to cold and dampness, the body warm and
perspiring, will set up a catarrhal process in the bile-ducts and
intestine, especially in those having the special susceptibility which
belongs to certain bodily types.Malarial miasm is an especially active
cause in malarial regions.The writer has seen many examples in various
parts of the United States within the malaria-breeding zone.Other
miasmatic agencies are not without importance.The exhalations from the
{1052} freshly-upturned soil of some cities, the gases from cesspools
and sewers, and illuminating gas exert a causative influence.The bad
air thus made up has been happily called civic malaria.The most influential causes of catarrh of the biliary passages are
local in origin and in action: they are the agencies which induce
catarrh of the duodenum.Disturbances of the portal circulation should
be first named.Whenever obstructive lesions of the cardiac orifices
exist, whenever the pulmonary circulation is impeded by disease of the
lungs, the portal vein is kept abnormally full, and as a necessary
result of the stasis a catarrh of the mucous membrane follows.Congestion of the portal system may be a result of vaso-motor paresis.The abdominal sympathetic may be the seat of various reflex
disturbances: those of a depressing kind induce stasis in the portal
system.Certain medicinal agents have this effect, and prolonged and
severe cutaneous irritation, it is probable, may act on the portal
circulation in the same way.The action of cold on the peripheral
nerves may be similarly explained.Catarrh by contiguity of tissue is the most frequent factor.Catarrh of
the duodenal mucous membrane is the initial condition, and from thence
the process extends to the bile-ducts.Although the duodenum may be
alone affected, the usual state of things is a gastro-intestinal
catarrh, the stomach and the whole length of the small intestine being
simultaneously diseased.When the catarrhal process is thus diffused
the duodenal mucous membrane is most deranged, probably because the
acid and fermenting chyme is first received here, and what acridity
soever it may possess attacks this part in its greatest strength.It
must be remembered that the secretion of the duodenal glands and of the
pancreas and liver must also have an abnormal character; hence those
foods which in the healthy condition of things are digested in this
part of the canal undergo ordinary putrefactive decomposition and
furnish very irritating products.This observation is especially true
of the fats: the fat acids are in the highest degree irritating.The
digestive fluid of the duodenum has a more or less pathological
character, because the catarrhal process not only interferes with the
habitually easy flow of the gland secretions, but, extending to the
gland elements themselves, gradually alter their structure.Gastro-intestinal catarrh results from the misuse of foods and the
abuse of certain condiments and of spirits.Excess in the quantity of
starchy, saccharine, and fatty foods which undergo conversion and
absorption in the intestine, habitually consumed, decomposition of such
portions as escape proper digestion ensues, and the products of this
decomposition exercise an irritant influence on the mucous membrane.The daily consumption of sauces and condiments and of highly-seasoned
foods has a constant irritating action; but more influential than any
other causative agency is the abuse of malt liquors and spirit.Whilst
the latter acts more on the stomach and the liver proper, the former
affect more the duodenal mucous membrane and the bile-ducts.To these causative agencies must be added a pathological state of the
bile itself.Under conditions not now known the bile seems to acquire
acrid properties and set up a catarrh in passing along the ducts.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The area affected by the catarrhal process
varies greatly.The termination of the common duct for a short space
may be the only part affected, but with this there is always more or
less, {1053} sometimes most extensive and severe, duodenal catarrh,
followed by jaundice.The extent to which the common duct is affected
may be exactly indicated by the staining with bile, which extends down
to the point of obstruction.The catarrhal process may invade the whole
extent of the common duct, the cystic duct, gall-bladder, and the
ramifications of the tube throughout the organ.The first change observable is a more or less considerable hyperaemia
of the mucous membrane; but this is rarely seen, because the
examination cannot be made at the time when this condition is present.The epithelial layer is swollen, sodden, the cells cloudy, undergoing
rapid multiplication and desquamating.The cast-off cylindrical
epithelium, mucous cells, and serum make up a turbid mixture, which,
with bile, fills the smaller ducts, and may in places, especially at
the orifice of the common duct, form an obstruction sufficient to
prevent the passage of the bile; which may, however, be readily pressed
out with a little force.Especially near the end of the common duct the
mucus is apt to accumulate, and a plug of it, often tenacious and
somewhat consistent, obstructs the orifice.It is probable that whilst
catarrh is the chief cause of jaundice, it may also, by a merely
intermittent activity, cause the condition of biliousness--now so far
relieved as to permit the bile to descend into the intestine, now so
much obstruction as to prevent the escape of any considerable part of
that formed.When the common duct is the seat of the catarrhal process,
and the outflow of bile thus prevented, it accumulates in the
gall-bladder, which may be so far distended as to present a
recognizable tumor of pyriform shape through the abdominal parietes.When the catarrhal process invades the finer ducts the appearances are
somewhat different.There are no bile-stains along the course of the
common and cystic ducts, and the gall-bladder is empty, or at most
contains only some mucus, with altered bile.The tubes at or near their
ultimate ramifications contain a turbid mucus composed of cylindrical
epithelium and lymphoid cells, and tenacious enough to close them
firmly.More or less hyperaemia of the liver-structures proper, and
consequent increased dimensions of the organ, a more or less active
catarrhal condition of the duodenal mucous membrane, accompany the
changes in the finer ducts.SYMPTOMS.--There are marked differences in the behavior of the more
acute cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts and the chronic examples of
the same disorder.The former is held to be the most frequent cause of
jaundice, whilst the latter is an important element in the so-called
bilious state, in lithaemia, and as a secondary condition in some
cardiac and pulmonary diseases.Also, the morbid complexus of catarrh
of the bile-ducts includes the symptoms of duodenal and gastro-duodenal
catarrh.The acute form of this disease sets in with the symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh.Usually, after indulgence in too highly
stimulating food or in some article having a specially irritating
character, an attack of acute indigestion supervenes.The tongue is
more or less heavily coated, the breath heavy, the taste bitter, pasty,
or sourish, the appetite poor or actual repugnance to food, especially
to the offending articles, is experienced, and nausea, not unfrequently
vomiting, ensues.The epigastrium and the hypochondriac regions have a
heavy, overloaded, distressed, {1054} and sore feeling; there is some
tenderness to pressure; sometimes the gall-bladder, abnormally full,
may be detected by careful palpation; and the area of hepatic dulness
will usually be increased.The abdomen is more or less distended by
gases, and eructations of offensive gases (hydrogen and sulphur
compounds, volatile fat acids, etc.)Constipation exists when
the catarrhal process is limited to the duodenum, and the stools
consist of hard lumps having a light yellow, clay-, or whitish
appearance.When the whole extent of the small intestine is affected,
the stools will be soft, liquid, or watery, and will vary in color from
yellow to gray or white.In some cases the fecal matters will have an
offensive odor--the odor of decomposition--and considerable discharges
of very foul-smelling gas will attend the evacuations.This symptom
will occur when the intestinal digestion is suspended and the contents
of the bowel in consequence undergo putrefactive decomposition.During the initial period of the disorder the urine will simply be
high- and loaded with urates and uric acid, but when jaundice
supervenes the pigment will convert the urine into a dark,
coffee-, and somewhat thick liquid.With the onset of the malady symptoms referable to the nervous system
appear.Headache, dizziness, and hebetude of mind are present, and now
and then an attack of catarrh of the bile-ducts will have the objective
signs of an ordinary migraine or sick headache.Usually, however, as
the intestinal and hepatic troubles develop, headache and some mental
hebetude come on, but when jaundice supervenes the headache becomes
more severe, and very considerable mental depression, irritability of
temper, and moroseness are experienced.Chilly sensations, with flashes
of heat, are felt at the outset, but with the appearance of jaundice
the sensation of coldness predominates.In some cases, the intestinal
catarrh being extensive, there will be, after some preliminary
chilliness, a febrile movement, but this is never of a pronounced
character, and in the slighter cases of the disease or when the
catarrhal process is limited to the bile-ducts, there is no elevation
of temperature.With the first symptoms the pulse is somewhat
quickened, but as the bile acids accumulate in the blood they effect a
decided slowing of the heart's action, the pulse falling as low, it may
be, as 50 per minute.This lessened activity of the circulation is
accompanied by corresponding reduction of temperature, the body-heat
falling a degree or more.The most distinctive symptom of catarrh of the bile-ducts is jaundice.In the acute or quickly-developing form above described of catarrhal
icterus the symptoms of gastro-intestinal disturbance precede the first
indication of jaundice from five to eight days.Yellowness of the
conjunctiva and of those parts of the body exposed to the air is the
first manifestation; afterward the jaundice hue becomes general.The
tint varies in depth from a faint gamboge-yellow, only discernible in a
favorable light, to a deep greenish- or brownish-yellow.In the more chronic cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts the symptoms are
simply those of a gastro-duodenal catarrh, to which some hepatic
disturbances are superadded.Some abdominal uneasiness felt in the
epigastrium and in the right hypochondrium, especially in two to three
hours after meals; flatulence, sometimes accompanied by colic; {1055}
constipation, persistent or alternating with diarrhoea--in the one case
in hard lumps with more or less mucus adherent, in the other soft or
liquid, and in both cases having a rather golden-yellow color, grayish
or black and tar-like appearance,--such are the symptoms referable to
the intestinal canal.The disturbances in the hepatic functions
produced by the catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane of the ducts
are further exhibited in a somewhat sallow, earthy, or muddy
complexion, yellowish tint of the conjunctiva, high-, acid urine
loaded with urates and phosphates.Such subjects, although having, it
may be, a keen appetite, rather lose than gain in weight: they
experience lassitude, headache, much depression of spirits, and the
mental symptoms are most pronounced during the time intestinal
digestion is going on.In fact, the morbid complexus is rather that of
intestinal catarrh; nevertheless, the slight degree of obstruction to
the outflow of bile occurring in these cases has an influence both in
the intestinal digestion and in the nutritive functions.Any degree of
obstruction, as has already been pointed out, leads to serious
structural change of the liver, and this in turn produces well-defined
symptoms.Disturbances of the hepatic functions, even jaundice, accompany the
paroxysms of malarial fever.Without the occurrence of fever, catarrhal
jaundice may come on during the course of chronic malarial poisoning.Catarrh of the bile-ducts is the pathogenetic factor in these cases.More especially in malarial regions, but also in temperate and warm
climates, paroxysmal attacks, with or without jaundice, are
comparatively frequent.These acute seizures occur in those having the
chronic form of the malady, and are excited by sudden climatic changes,
by excesses in eating, especially by the use of improper articles of
diet.Considerable nausea, flatulence, and constipation or diarrhoea,
weight, tension, and soreness in the right hypochondrium and sometimes
in the shoulder, chilliness, general malaise, headache, and an
increasing icterode tint of the skin, constitute the complexus of
symptoms belonging to these cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Acute catarrh of the bile-ducts
with jaundice has a well-defined course--in its mildest form, with
little gastric or gastro-intestinal disturbance--lasting ten days or
two weeks; in the ordinary form, with the accompanying gastro-duodenal
catarrh, running its course in a month to six weeks.In the chronic
form, with acute exacerbations due to indiscretions in diet or to
climatic influences, the course of the disease is chequered by
vicissitudes, the result of the causes just mentioned, and its duration
must therefore be indefinite and, as a rule, protracted.Catarrh of the
bile-ducts, or catarrhal jaundice, usually terminates in health after a
period of functional derangement of the intestines and liver.Without
exhibiting any features of a special character, some cases do not pass
through this benign course: the intestinal catarrh sets up an
ulcerative process at one or more points in the duodenum; but more
especially the obstruction to the free course of the bile caused by the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous lining of the ducts induces structural
changes in the liver--an hypertrophy of the connective-tissue elements,
a sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--There are but two signs which indicate the nature of the
disorder, and only one that is really distinctive.Intestinal
indigestion with slight coincident biliary derangement is one, and
jaundice is the {1056} other.When, after the signs and symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh have declared themselves, jaundice appears,
there can be no question as to the nature of the case.The diagnosis is
more difficult in the chronic cases with exacerbations due to the
exciting causes above mentioned, for the persistence of the jaundice
will suggest the occurrence of some permanent organic lesion.The
differentiation of the various kinds of jaundice has already been made.TREATMENT.--Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Those
foods requiring the intestinal juices for their solution and
absorption, and which cannot be properly digested when a duodenal
catarrh exists or when bile is absent, should of course be excluded
from the diet.These articles are the fats, starches, and sweets.The
mucus playing the part of a ferment, these substances are converted
into various secondary products of an irritating character.Flatulence
is caused by the evolution of carbonic acid gas and the hydrogen
compounds of sulphur and phosphorus; and acetic, butyric, and other
acids not only change the reaction of the intestinal juices, but are
directly irritating to the mucous membrane.In the acute cases a diet
of skimmed milk, taken hot and at three hours' interval, and after the
acute symptoms have subsided, in conjunction with some other aliment,
is the most appropriate mode of alimentation.Meats, fish, eggs, and
oysters are the chief articles of diet, besides the milk, during the
whole course of the more chronic cases; and to these may be added the
succulent vegetables, as lettuce, spinach, celery, raw cabbage, and
tomatoes.If, in consequence of irritability of the mucous membrane or
of idiosyncrasy, any article occasions distress, it should be omitted
from the diet.The medicinal management includes the administration of remedies for
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The treatment of catarrhal jaundice has been
discussed.When constipation exists, saline laxatives, especially
phosphate of sodium and Rochelle salt, are useful.If there be
diarrhoea, the most appropriate remedies are bismuth, with or without
carbolic acid, Hope's mixture, oxides of zinc and silver, and other
mineral tonic astringents.The propriety of the administration of special hepatic
stimulants--cholagogues--has been much disputed.When the disorder
consists merely in an obstruction to the outflow of bile, the utility
of stimulating the production of this secretion seems more than
doubtful.Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate use of mercury.Its power to increase the production of bile having been assumed, and
the quantity of bile present in the feces being manifestly less in
cases of catarrhal jaundice, it followed that mercury should be
employed in this disorder.Modern experience has quite demonstrated its
inutility in the mode and for the purpose to which it was formerly
devoted.Nevertheless, good effects are had from calomel in small doses
as a sedative to the mucous membrane.When there are nausea, headache,
vertigo, and constipation present, excellent results may be had from
the 1/20 gr.of calomel, exhibited at short intervals until
the bowels are moved.If calomel possessed the property formerly
ascribed to it, of stimulating the hepatic functions, it would be
contraindicated in catarrh of the bile-ducts.This contraindication
exists in respect to all hepatic stimulants.If there be decided irritability of the stomach and constipation,
{1057} Seidlitz powders may be given at regular intervals.Phosphate of
sodium in drachm doses is highly useful for the double purpose of a
laxative effect and to prevent the tendency to inspissation of the
bile, which is one of the most important results of catarrh of the
bile-ducts and gall-bladder.In the more chronic cases the persistent
use of sodium phosphate is to be highly commended.In this disease, especially as it occurs in gouty subjects, sulphate of
manganese is often decidedly serviceable.If anaemia and debility
coexist, this remedy can be combined with sulphate of iron and sulphate
of quinine--a combination which the writer has found peculiarly
effective under such circumstances.When oxidation is deficient and the
urates are present in the urine in excessive quantity, good effects are
had from the permanganate of potassium, a tablet containing two grains
being given four times a day.In the more chronic cases the salts of
silver, copper, and zinc are really very useful, especially the oxides
of silver and zinc; and of these the former is more efficient.Better
than any of those mentioned is arsenic, as arseniate of sodium or as
Fowler's solution, but the best results are had from small or medium
doses persistently used.If there be much intestinal catarrh and
consequent diarrhoea, bismuth and aromatic powder, oxide of silver,
Fowler's solution with a little opium, Hope's mixture, etc.It is in catarrh of the bile-ducts that nitric and nitro-muriatic acids
have proved useful, rather than in cirrhosis and other diseases of the
liver-tissues.They prevent fermentation, promote oxidation, and
increase the activity of the assimilative functions.When there occurs
active fermentation of certain foods, and consequently considerable
flatulence, excellent results are obtained from the members of the
antiseptic group--from creasote or carbolic acid, salicylic acid,
biborate of sodium, the benzoates, etc.To these may be added quinine,
the dose of which will be determined by the purpose for which it is
prescribed.So often is catarrhal jaundice of malarial origin that
quinine becomes a remedy of high importance in the cases occurring in
the malarial-forming zone.Certain special plans of treatment have been proposed for the cure of
catarrhal jaundice.One of the most effective of these is enemata of
cold water.By means of an irrigating apparatus the large intestine is
well distended with water once a day for several days.The first enema
has a temperature of 60 degrees F., and subsequent injections are a
little warmer.The increased peristalsis of the bowels and the reflex
contractions of the gall-bladder dislodge the mucus lining and
obstructing the gall-ducts.Daniel went to the bedroom.When the bile flows into the intestine,
digestion is resumed and the catarrhal inflammation subsides.But with
the irrigation method may be employed other remedies, as above
indicated.Faradization of the gall-bladder has been used successfully for the
expulsion of the stored-up bile and the removal of the mucus
obstructing the ducts.It is applied by means of one moistened sponge
electrode placed directly over the gall-bladder, and the other on the
opposite side of the body and posteriorly.A slowly-interrupted faradic
current is then passed.This expedient is not suitable when the case is
acute in character.{1058} Biliary Concretions; Gall-Stones; Hepatic Calculi; Hepatic
Colic.DEFINITION.--There are two classes of concretions which may occasion
symptoms: inspissated bile and regularly-formed gall-stones.Slowly-developing symptoms of jaundice from obstruction may arise from
the deposit of particles of inspissated bile in the hepatic ducts, or
sudden attacks of hepatic colic be due to the passage of concretions.When biliary calculi reach the intestines, certain kinds of disturbance
may be caused by their presence there.Under the term biliary
concretions must be considered, therefore, the mechanism of their
production, their composition, the symptoms caused by their passage
through the ducts (hepatic colic), and the intestinal disturbance due
to their retention in the bowel.Formation: Inspissated Bile.--Those concretions consisting of
inspissated bile are irregularly-shaped masses of a brownish,
greenish-brown, or reddish-brown color, friable and crumbling into a
gritty dust with slight pressure of the fingers.When recent and before
drying, they are softer, almost pultaceous, and may take the form of
the canal through which pressed.But as seen after drying they present
the appearance of a dark vegetable extract, dried and partly
pulverized.When examined as found in the gall-bladder or lodged in the
larger hepatic ducts or distributed in irregular fragments (gall-sand)
in the various hepatic passages, they present the shape, color, and
general characteristics of a partly-dried vegetable extract roughly
broken up, but still soft enough to take any shape from pressure.The
writer has seen them thus in situ accompanying regularly-formed
gall-stones in a case of gunshot wound of the liver.These masses of
inspissated bile differ from gall-stones in composition; they consist
of bile, but with a preponderance of the coloring matter.According to
Harley,[153] who has given a more correct account of these bodies than
any other systematic writer, their composition is as follows:

  Water    5.4
  Solids  94.6

The contents of the solids are--

  Bile-pigment                84.2
  Cholesterin                  0.6
  Salts (iron, potash, soda)  15.2

[Footnote 153: _The Diseases of the Liver, with and without Jaundice,
etc._, by George Harley, M.D., F.R.S., Philada., 1883, p.Some years ago, before I was aware of the nature of such concretions.I
detected a number in examining the stools of a patient who had in quick
succession many attacks of hepatic colic, but as the usual form of
concretion was looked for and not found, the relation of these bodies
to the symptoms in the case was not understood.I now recognize the
value of Harley's observations on these bodies.The biliary concretion which is properly a gall-stone has a definite
form and a more or less well-defined crystalline structure.The most usual form is octagonal or hexagonal or
polyangular, with smooth facets, corresponding to points of contact of
other calculi.Instead of smooth facets and sharp angles, the
concretion may be studded with irregularly-shaped masses.When there
are numerous {1059} calculi present, they have smooth surfaces and
rather sharp angles, made, not by attrition, as has been supposed, but
by deposition of the new material under pressure.When they have this
form there are many present, but the number of facets does not indicate
the number of calculi, and the absence of facets is not proof of the
absence of other calculi.The smooth opposing surfaces are not always
plane, but may be convex or concave to fit the shape of the adjacent
bodies.Calculi may be globular, ovoid, cylindrical, and truncated cones.The
largest in my collection is egg-shaped, and nearly filled the
gall-bladder which contained it, a little mucus free from bile-elements
only being present.If a concretion forms in a duct or a single one is
present in the gall-bladder, the shape is determined by the pressure of
the walls of the duct or of the gall-bladder, respectively.As found in
the stools, and still somewhat soft, the shape will represent the form
of the common duct through which it has been pressed.Such a soft,
recently-formed gall-stone will have the crystalline structure and
chemical constitution of these bodies, and will therefore differ from,
apparently, similar masses of inspissated bile.Although a round,
ovoid, or cylindrical calculus indicates the absence of others because
there are no evidences of mutual pressure and adaptation, a positive
conclusion cannot be reached in that way, for the gall-bladder may
contain numerous calculi of long-standing, and a recent concretion
formed in a duct be discharged with the usual symptoms.The number of calculi which may be present at any time or be produced
in the course of years ranges from one to several thousand.The number
is in inverse ratio to the size.One case[154] is reported in which
7802 calculi were found in the gall-bladder, but they must have been
very minute in size.Of the specimens now in my collection, there are
230 obtained from one gall-bladder, which they entirely filled; they
are nearly uniform in size, have an average weight of two grains, and
contain four, five, and six smooth facets.Another collection of
calculi removed from a closed gall-bladder contains 45, of large size,
distending the organ and forming a tumor which projected beyond the
margin of the liver.Hepatic calculi are rarely solitary; hence if one
attack of hepatic colic occur, others may be expected.[Footnote 154: Frerichs, _op.In color gall-stones vary from a clear white to a dark-brown, almost
black, tint.The most usual tint of the mature calculi in the
gall-bladder is that of the ripe chestnut.Long stay in the intestines
increases the depth of the color, until it becomes almost black; on the
other hand, detention in the gall-bladder has a slightly bleaching
action; but the real cause of difference of color is the presence or
absence of pigment.If composed of pure cholesterin, the color will be
whitish, opaque, or glistening and almost translucent.In size gall-stones vary from the smallest pea up to a hen's egg.When
several hundreds are contained in the gall-bladder, they will usually
be of the dimension of a medium-sized pea.Two large solitary
concretions in my possession are respectively 2 inches and 1-1/2 inches
in long diameter, and 1 inch and 3/4 of an inch transversely.Very much
larger calculi have, however, been recorded; thus, one mentioned by
Frerichs is 5 inches in length and 4 inches in circumference.The most
frequently {1060} encountered calculus, at least in this country, is
polyangular in shape and of the size of a large pea.Globular or ovoid
seems to be the prevailing form, and the dimensions that of a small
pea, in Germany, according to Frerichs and Von Schuppel, but this
statement must refer to the initial shape of these bodies.Not all hepatic calculi have defined mathematical forms, but may
consist of branching cylinders composed of irregular nodular masses,
not unlike the concretions of inspissated bile.As a rule, in each case
where the calculi are multiple there is uniformity of color, shape, and
composition.The
calculi obtained from each subject are in one case white, polyangular,
rather unctuous, and nearly equal in size; in another, chestnut-brown
in color, polyangular in shape, and varying slightly in size, but
uniformly characteristic in shape; and in a third, singular in number,
ovoid in shape, dark-brown in color.When fresh they contain
considerable water, and at all times are hygroscopic.Dried in the air,
they are composed of--

  Water    4
  Solids  96
         ---
         100

The solids consist of--

  Cholesterin                  98
  Pigment                       1
  Inorganic or mineral matter   1
                              ---
                              100

Such are the constituents, according to Harley, of the usual
concretion, the cholesterin calculus.But as other varieties are
encountered occasionally, it may be well to give the composition of
these.The following table by Ritter, to be found in _Robin's Journal_
for 1872 (p.60), is a correct representation of the contents of
different specimens:

---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----

The above may be regarded as the average composition, expressed in
round numbers.The variations from these figures will be comprehended
in two parts.A calculus consists of three several parts: the nucleus, the body, the
rind.A calculus of small or medium size may be a nucleus for the
formation of a large one.Usually the nucleus consists of a bit of
mucus, casts of the biliary ducts (Thudicum), inspissated bile, a
blood-clot, a liver-fluke or other parasite, as a desiccated
round-worm, or some foreign body, as a seed, or, as in one reported
example, a globule of mercury.[155] {1061} The central mass of mucus
may contain a large proportion of pigment or crystals of cholesterin or
lime-salts, giving it special characteristics.[156] There may be
several nuclei.Fauconneau-Dufresne reports an instance in which a
pyramidal concretion contained four, and Guilbert a globular stone with
five, distinct nuclei.Such examples of calculi having multiple nuclei
are produced by the adhesion whilst in a soft state of two or more, and
the subsequent addition of material to the conjoint mass, welding it
into a single stone.A few calculi are homogeneous throughout, composed
of nearly pure cholesterin, mixed intimately with a little coloring
matter and lime salts.The cholesterin calculus will have a somewhat
translucent appearance, will be a dead white or a yellowish-white, or
present a greenish- or brownish-yellow tint through the white.Even the
white calculus, apparently composed of nearly pure cholesterin, will be
found on section to contain traces of a nucleus.By long detention in a
gall-bladder whose duct is permanently occluded, and is therefore free
of fluid, the mucus nucleus may so shrivel as to leave a cavity which
is merely stained.One of my specimens--a solitary calculus of large
size--exhibits this peculiarity.[Footnote 155: Thudicum, J. L., _On Gall-stones_, London, 1863; also
Frerichs, _op.[Footnote 156: Cyr, Jules, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_,
Paris, 1884, p.11 _et seq._]

The body consists of cholesterin, nacreous or darkened by pigment,
deposited in radiating lines or in concentric layers, or in both
together.Pigment may be intimately incorporated with the cholesterin
or deposited between the layers of this substance, pure or nearly pure,
forming an alternating arrangement.The crust or rind usually is smooth, unctuous to the touch, firm, but
when broken with the finger-nail readily crumbles.When composed of
lime salts, or when the cholesterin is mixed with varying proportions
of these salts and of pigment, the surface is still smooth, but
thicker, firmer, and darker in color.The rind may not be smooth, but
studded with wart-like projections, or it may consist of several layers
of earthy matter separated by pigment.These layers may be very
friable, and readily crumble and fall off.In some instances the crust,
several lines in thickness, is the body of the calculus, and the cavity
contains only a light honeycomb of mucus and pigment.The specific gravity of gall-stones composed of crystallized
cholesterin is nearly that of water.Air-dried calculi will float on
water, but the recent ones, full of moisture, sink.The relation of the
weight of the calculus to that of the bile is more important.As the
specific gravity of bile ranges from 1020 to 1026, it is obvious that
on this fluid air-dried calculi will float, but, holding in the recent
state much water, ordinary gall-stones will sink.Those containing much
mineral matter will have a correspondingly high specific gravity--much
higher than bile.ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF HEPATIC CALCULI.--Certain conditions are
necessary to the formation of these bodies on the part of the bile and
on the part of the gall-bladder and ducts.Constituted for the most
part of cholesterin, which exists in such small quantity in normal
bile, there must be some change in the composition of this fluid to
increase the quantity or to diminish the solubility of that
constituent.It will conduce to a better understanding of the subject
to premise the composition of the bile: {1062}

  Bile contains, in 1000 parts,
    Water            860
    Solids           140

  The solids of bile are,
    Glycocholate and Taurocholate of soda  90.8
    Fat                                     9.2
    Cholesterin                             2.6
    Mucus                                   1.4
    Pigment and extractive                 28.Salts                                   8.-----
                                          140.Normal bile is neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction.If the
reaction become acid from any cause, the constituent cholesterin is
precipitated; and this occurs the more readily the larger the
proportion of this substance held in solution.Cholesterin is an
excrementitious material found in the blood and excreted by the liver.It represents in part, probably, the waste of nervous matter, but more
certainly of the fatty tissues in general.Conditions of the system in
which the metamorphosis of the fatty elements occurs more freely--as
obesity, advancing life, etc.--are accompanied by an increased
production and excretion of cholesterin.So long as the neutral state or the alkalinity of the bile is
maintained, the cholesterin will be kept in solution, although its
relative proportion may be in excess of the normal.A lack of the soda
constituent of the system is one factor, but the most important is a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane of the bile-ducts and
gall-bladder.The mucus formed plays a double role: it furnishes a
nucleus about which cholesterin crystallizes; it acts as a ferment and
inaugurates a process of acid fermentation which results in the
precipitation of cholesterin.When all the conditions favorable to the
separation and crystallization of cholesterin are present, any foreign
body may serve the purpose of a nucleus.The articles which have thus
served have been enumerated.A by no means infrequent combination is that of bilirubin with calcium;
and this may constitute the nucleus or form a part of the body or the
crust of a calculus.The mechanism of its formation is not unlike that
of the cholesterin concretion.Bilirubin is soluble in alkalies, and is
precipitated from its solution by acids.It follows that when acid
fermentation takes places under the influence of mucus, bilirubin may
be precipitated in combination with calcium.The salts of sodium and
potassium are much more abundant in bile than those of lime, but the
latter much more often enter into the formation of calculi because of
their slighter solubility.Other combinations of bile-pigments, mucus,
and the salts of the bile take place, but they are relatively less
frequent.The principal lime salt is the carbonate, and this combines
in varying proportions with the bile acids, the fat acids, and
bile-pigment.Certain physical conditions are not less important than the chemical in
the production of hepatic calculi.Accumulation of bile in the
gall-bladder, stasis, and concentration are essential conditions.If
bile remains long in the gall-bladder, it becomes darker in color and
more viscid, its specific gravity rises, and the relative proportion of
solids increases, doubtless because of the absorption of a part of the
water.The reaction--which, as has been stated, is in the fresh state
neutral or {1063} alkaline--becomes acid in consequence of a
fermentative change (Von Gorup-Besanez) set up by the mucus.If a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane exist, the mucus, epithelium,
and lymphoid cells cast off play the part of a ferment.The lime which
is so important a constituent of biliary concretions is not present
even in concentrated bile in sufficient amount to account for its
agency in the formation of these bodies, is furnished by the diseased
mucous membrane (Frerichs).Indeed, numerous crystals of carbonate of
lime have been seen in situ in contact with the mucous membrane in
cases of chronic catarrh.It follows, then, that catarrh of the biliary
passages has an important causative relation to that pathological
condition of the bile which precedes the formation of calculi.In this
connection we must not lose sight of the researches made by Ord[157] on
the action exerted by colloids on the formation of concretions.The
mucus is the colloid; cholesterin, lime, and soda salts are the
crystalloids.These latter diffusing through the colloid medium, the
resulting combinations assume spheroidal forms.The union of bilirubin
and lime salts illustrates the same principle.[Footnote 157: _On the Influence of Colloids upon Crystalline Forms and
Cohesion, with Observations on the Structure and Mode of Formation of
Urinary and other Calculi_, by W. Miller Ord, M.D., F.R.C.P.Lond.,
etc., London, 1879.]CAUSES.--We have here to consider the external conditions and the
general somatic influences which lead to the formation of biliary
concretions.Besides other
agencies due to advancing life, the increase of cholesterin is an
influential factor.The less active state of the functions in general,
diminished oxidation, loss of water, and concentration of the bile are
influential factors in determining the formation of hepatic calculi in
advancing life, as the opposite conditions oppose their production in
early life.Although not unknown in infancy, at this period in life and
until twenty years of age they occur but rarely.Fauconneau-Dufresne,[158] of 91 cases, had 4 in infants; Wolff[159] had
1 in a collection of 45 cases; and Cyr,[160] 2 cases under ten in a
group of 558 cases.The following table illustrates the influence of
age on the productivity of gall-stones:

p.[Footnote 160: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, Paris, 1884,
p.Although there is a general correspondence in the results of the
observations on the age most liable, there are differences.Thus, Cyr,
whose figures represent the experiences at Vichy, makes the age of
maximum liability from twenty to forty years--distinctly earlier than
any other observer; and hence it is necessary to bear in mind the
extreme latitude of his diagnosis.Of my own collection, 30 in number,
all doubtful cases {1064} excluded, there were 20 between thirty and
fifty years, and 10 between fifty and seventy.Of these, 22 occurred in
subjects between forty and sixty.The period of maximum liability is
about fifty years of age.Cyr refers the difference of his statistics
from those of other observers to the character of the patients.The
preponderance in the number of cases of hepatic calculi at or about the
fiftieth year is referable to the lessened activity of the nutritive
functions at this period, and to the increase in the relative
proportion of cholesterin in the blood in advanced life (Luton[161]).Charcot[162] maintains that after sixty biliary calculi are more
frequent, but owing to the physiological conditions then existing the
migration of these bodies is effected without notable inconvenience.[Footnote 161: Jaccoud's _Dictionnaire encycloped._, art."Voies
Biliaires;" _idem._, _Bull.de Therap._, March 15, 1866.][Footnote 162: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.According to most authorities, females are more liable to the formation
of gall-stones than are men.Thudicum, after an analysis of the
statistics given by the most experienced and celebrated authorities,
places the proportion at 3 to 2.Von Schuppel gives the same figures.Cyr, whilst recognizing this estimate as true of the great mass of
observations on this point, finds that in his own cases the
preponderance of females over males was even greater, being 4 to
1--inversely to the liability of the sexes to gout; but this excess is
to be explained by the character of the subjects falling under his
observation.Women are subjected to influences which favor the
formation of these concretions, such as pregnancy, sedentary habits,
diet of a restricted character, the use of corsets, and the somatic
changes at the climacteric period.The social state, by reason of the conditions associated with a good
position in life, has an influence in the production of calculi.Luxurious habits and indulgence in the pleasures of the table are
important factors, and hence this malady is encountered amongst the
better class of patients in private practice rather than amongst
laboring people in the hospitals.As the somatic conditions which exert a predisposing action, and the
social circumstances also favoring the formation of hepatic calculi,
are transmitted, heredity is by some classed among the etiological
factors, but it can only be regarded as indirect.Malarial influences unquestionably exert a very powerful influence as
this malady occurs in this country.Paroxysms of intermittent either
induce or accompany the seizures of hepatic colic, and chronic malarial
poisoning exerts a direct causative influence through the hepatic
disturbances and the gastro-duodenal catarrh which are associated with
it.Attacks of hepatic colic are extremely frequent in the malarial
regions of the West and South.It may be, however, that this malady is
frequent rather in consequence of the diet of pork than of climatic
causes, for it is probable that indulgence in such food plays an
important part in the formation of biliary concretions (Harley).Due
allowance made for diet, climate is yet, no doubt, an influential
factor.In warm, especially in malarial, regions the functions of the
liver are taxed to compensate for the increased action of the skin and
lungs; but this organ is, besides, affected by the poison of malaria,
and to the congestion caused by it is superadded a catarrhal state of
the bile-ducts and of the duodenum.A {1065} pathological condition of
the bile itself is first induced; then the fermentative changes set up
by the mucus cause the separation and crystallization of pigment and
cholesterin.Certain seasons favor the formation of biliary concretions, because
then the special influences which operate at all times are more active
and persistent.These seasons are fall, winter, and early spring, and
gall-stones are more numerous then in consequence of the activity of
the malarial poison, the character of the diet then employed, and the
lessened oxidation due to the more sedentary life.Climate is a factor
of some consequence, but not in the direction that might have been
supposed.Gall-stones are more common in temperate than in tropical
climates--a statement confirmed by the observation of the physicians of
India.They are, according to Harley, quite common in Russia, where
also they attain to extraordinary dimensions; but these circumstances
are not due to the climatic peculiarities of that country, so much as
to the diet habitually consumed, consisting so largely of fatty
substances.Of all the conditions which favor the production of gall-stones, none
are so influential as the bodily state and the associated dietetic
peculiarities.Those troubled with these concretions, as they have
occurred under my observation, have been either obese or have had a
manifest tendency in that direction.They have had a strong inclination
for the fat-forming foods, also for starchy, saccharine, and fatty
articles, such as bread and butter, potatoes, beans and peas, pork,
bacon, and fat poultry, etc.Harley thinks indulgence in bacon (p.Thudicum rejects this notion on chemical grounds,
for obesity and the free consumption of fat cannot be concerned in the
production of these bodies, because cholesterin is an alcohol.[163] The
agency of a fatty diet has been so strongly indicated in clinical
observations, and the relation of cholesterin to the fats so obvious,
that it can hardly be doubted the free consumption of fat in food
contributes directly to the formation of calculi.A catarrhal state of the duodenal mucous membrane
existing, and the bile excluded by swelling and obstruction of the
bile-ducts, fats are decomposed, and the fat acids, absorbed into the
portal blood, contribute to those chemical changes in the bile which
result in the precipitation of cholesterin.Beneke[164] traces a
connection between atheromatous degeneration of the vessels and the
formation of biliary concretions.A general increase in the amount of
fat in the body is usually coincident with the atheromatous change, and
at the same time the relative proportion of cholesterin in the bile
becomes greater.[Footnote 163: _A Treatise on Gall-stones_, p.Indulgence in the starchy and saccharine foods plays a part in the
formation of gall-stones not less, if not more, important than the
consumption of fats.A diet of such materials is highly fattening, and
if the necessary local conditions exist they readily undergo
fermentation, and thus cause or keep up a catarrh of the mucous
membrane.Too long intervals between meals, Frerichs[165] thinks, is more
influential than errors of diet in causing concretions.The bile
accumulates in the gall-bladder, and the condition of repose favors the
occurrence of those changes which induce the separation and
crystallization of cholesterin.{1066} Obstacles to outflow of every
kind have the same effect.The largest calculus in my possession was
obtained from a case of cancer of the gall-bladder which compressed,
and finally closed, the cystic duct.Sedentary habits have the same
mechanical effect, but, as already pointed out, insufficient air and
exercise act by lessening oxidation.Corpulent persons indulging in
rich food and avoiding all physical exertion, those of such habits
confined to bed by illness or injury, the literary, the well-to-do,
self-indulgent, lazy, are usual subjects of this malady.Any condition
of things which causes a considerable retardation in the outflow of
bile will have a pathogenetic importance, especially if the causes of
chemical change, the lessened quantity of taurocholic and glycocholic
acid, and an increased quantity of cholesterin, coexist.Moral causes,
as fear, anxiety, chagrin, anger, etc., have seemed to exercise a
causative influence in some instances (Cyr).[Footnote 165: _A Clinical Treatise on Disease of the Liver_, Syd.To the causes of retardation of the bile-flow mentioned above must be
added catarrh of the bile-ducts.This acts in a twofold way--as an
obstruction; a plug of mucus forming the nucleus.It has already been
shown that fermentative changes may be set up by the mucus, which plays
the part of a ferment, an acid state of the bile resulting.Situation of Gall-stones, and their Destiny.--The gall-bladder is, of
course, the chief site for these bodies, but biliary concretions and
masses of inspissated bile may be found at any point in the course of
the ducts.Single stones may be impacted at any point in the cystic,
hepatic, or common duct, or masses composed of numerous small calculi
may take the form of a duct and branches, making a branching calculus
of the shape and size of the mould in which it is cast.Such casts may
be hollow, thus permitting an outlet to the bile, or they may
completely close the tube, and a cyst form, the walls of which grow
thicker with connective-tissue deposits.Stones of very large size may
be thus enclosed, Frerichs having seen one the size of a hen's egg
formed about a plum-seed, which was the nucleus.In some rare instances
the major part of the larger tubes have been filled with inspissated
bile, through which the fluid bile could only be slowly filtered.Calculi are not often found in the hepatic duct, since they can only
lodge there in descending from the smaller tubes, and hence are too
small to become wedged in.The usual site, as has been sufficiently
explained, is the gall-bladder.At the entrance to the cystic duct and
at the terminus of the common duct in the duodenum are the points where
migrating calculi are most apt to be arrested.Spontaneous disintegration of gall-stones sometimes occurs.Cholesterin
being dissolved off of the corners and edges, the cohesion of the mass
is impaired and it falls apart in several fragments.By very slight
mechanical injury air-dried calculi will be broken up.In the
gall-bladder two factors are in operation to effect the disintegration
of the contained calculi: the movements of the body, by which the
corners and the borders are crumbled; the solvent action of the
alkaline bile on the cholesterin.When, however, these concretions are
made up of lime and pigment, their integrity can be impaired only by
the process of cleavage; no solvent action can take place.Various changes occur in the ducts or in the gall-bladder in
consequence of the presence of these concretions.Whilst a catarrhal
state of the mucous {1067} membrane of the ducts is an element of much
importance in the process by which concretions are formed, on the other
hand the presence of these bodies excites catarrh, ulceration,
perforation, and, it may be, abscess of the liver.When concretions
form or are deposited in the ducts, they cause inflammatory reaction,
the walls yield, and the neighboring hepatic structures may also be
affected by contiguity.The dilatation of the tube is usually
cylindrical, much more rarely sacciform.The neighboring connective
tissue may undergo hyperplasia and a more or less extensive sclerosis
occur.More frequently the calculus ulcerates through, and an abscess
is produced which will take the usual course of that malady.Very
rarely a calculus is found enclosed in a separate sac and surrounded by
healthy hepatic tissue (Roller).[166]

[Footnote 166: _Berliner klin.42, 1879; _ibid._, Nos.16, 17, and 19 for 1877, Fargstein.]As the gall-bladder is the usual place for the formation and storage of
gall-stones, the changes in connection with this organ are the most
important.The calculi may be so numerous or so large as to distend the
gall-bladder and cause it to project from under the inferior border of
the liver, so as to be felt by palpation of the abdominal wall.The
stones may be few in number and float in healthy bile, or they may fill
the bladder to the exclusion of fluid, the cystic duct being closed
permanently; or there may be, with one or more concretions, a fluid
composed of mucus, muco-pus, serum, and bilious matter.The mucous
membrane may be in a normal state, but this is rare; usually it is
affected by the catarrhal process, and atrophic degeneration has taken
place to a less or greater extent; the rugae are obliterated, the
muscular layer hypertrophied.When attacks of hepatic colic have
occurred, more or less inflammation of the peritoneal layer of the
gall-bladder and cystic duct is lighted up, and organized exudations
form, changing the shape and position of the organs concerned.It is
usual in old cases of hepatic colic to find the gall-bladder bound down
by strong adhesions, the cavity much contracted or even obliterated,
the cystic duct closed, and the neighboring portion of the liver the
seat of sclerosis.Such inflammatory exudations about the gall-bladder
may become the seat of malignant disease--of scirrhus.Several examples
of this have been reported, and one has occurred in my own practice.The contact of a gall-stone, especially of a polyangular stone, may
cause ulceration of the mucous membrane.This is the more apt to occur
if the muscular layer of the gall-bladder is hypertrophied, especially
if certain fasciculi are thickened and overacting, leaving intervening
parts weak and yielding to the pressure of the stone forced in by the
spasmodically contracting muscles.Finally yielding, the stone and
other contents of the gall-bladder escape into the cavity of the
abdomen.Adhesions to neighboring parts may prevent rupture.Such
adhesions are contracted with the colon, the duodenum, the stomach, and
other organs.In some rare instances the closed gall-bladder has
undergone a gradual process of calcification, the mucous membrane
losing its proper structure, the muscular layer degenerating, and a
slow deposit of lime salts taking place, the ultimate result being that
the biliary concretions are enclosed in a permanent shell.As above indicated, biliary concretions may remain where deposited for
an indefinite period.Very often they migrate from the point of
formation, the gall-bladder, into the duodenum, producing
characteristic {1068} symptoms called hepatic colic.As the size of the
ducts increases from above downward, obviously but little vis a tergo
is needed to propel the concretions onward.The chief agency in the
migration of these bodies is the discharge of bile.Common observation
shows that the symptoms of hepatic colic usually declare themselves in
two or three hours after a meal--at that time when the presence of the
chyme in the duodenum solicits the flow of bile.The gall-bladder
contracts on its contents with an energy in direct ratio to the amount
of bile present, and with the gush of fluid the concretion is whirled
into the duct.Once there, the cystic duct being unprovided with
muscular fibres, the onward progress of the stone must depend on the
flow of bile; and, as the canal is devious, this may not always carry
the concretion into the common duct.Just behind the neck of the
gall-bladder the duct makes an angle somewhat abrupt, and here also its
folds project into the canal, so that at this point the stone is apt to
lodge; but much depends on the size and shape of the calculus.If it
pass through the cystic duct, the inflammation resulting may close the
canal, several instances of which have fallen under my observation.The
next point where stoppage of the migrating calculus may, and frequently
does, occur is the orifice of the common duct in the duodenum.This
orifice has a funnel shape, the smaller extremity toward the intestine,
the object of this being to prevent the entrance into the duct of
foreign bodies from the intestine.A diverticulum is thereby made
(Vater's) in which a concretion may lodge, partly or wholly preventing
the escape of bile into the bowel.The various forces concerned in the
propulsion of the concretion onward from the common duct into the
intestine are the discharges of bile, the contraction of the few
muscular fibres in the walls of the duct, the respiratory movements,
especially forced expiration, coughing, sneezing, vomiting,
defecation--in fact, all of those acts in which the abdominal muscles,
the diaphragm, and the sphincters are simultaneously brought into
strong contraction.The symptoms produced by the migration and stoppage
of a concretion will vary according to the size and shape of the stone,
and the consequent diminution in the amount of bile discharged or its
complete arrest.In other words, the stone may be firmly wedged in,
completely closing the canal against the passage of bile, or it may lie
loosely in the diverticulum Vateri, acting as a sort of ball valve, now
permitting a gush of bile, and now stopping the passage-way more or
less tightly.The migration of calculi may take place by ulcerating through into
neighboring hollow organs.Usually the first step consists in stoppage
of the bile.To the accumulating bile mucus is added, and the
gall-bladder or the duct--usually the common or cystic duct--dilates,
often to a considerable extent, and, adhesions forming, discharge
ultimately takes place through some neighboring hollow organ.The
routes pursued by such fistulous communications are various.The organs
most frequently penetrated are the stomach, duodenum, and colon, less
often the urinary passages, and very rarely the portal vein.Numerous
examples of external discharge of calculi have been reported.The most
usual, as it is the most direct, is the fistulous connection of the
gall-bladder or common duct with the duodenum.Solitary stones of
immense size have been thus discharged.Murchison[167] gives references
to many interesting {1069} examples, and the various volumes of
_Transactions of the Pathological Society_ are rich in illustrative
cases.The symptoms produced by the migration of calculi by the natural
route and by ulceration into other organs will be hereafter considered.[Footnote 167: _Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Liver_, 2d
ed., p.487 _et seq._]

SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF GALL-STONES AT THEIR ORIGINAL
SITE.--Very large calculi or numerous small ones may be present in the
biliary passages without causing any recognizable symptoms.The
migration of these bodies by the natural channel and by ulceration into
the duodenum may also be accomplished without any local or systemic
disturbance.[168] That the retention of calculi may not induce any
characteristic reaction by which they may be recognized is probably due
to the fact that the gall-bladder, in which they chiefly form,
possesses but slight sensibility, and as it is in a constantly changing
state of distension or emptiness according to the amount of bile
present, it is obvious that a foreign body made up of the biliary
constituents, and having nearly the same specific gravity as the bile,
is not likely to cause any uneasiness or recognizable functional
disturbances.Furthermore, the slowness with which biliary concretions
form enables the organ to accommodate itself to the new conditions.The
lack of sensibility which is a feature of the gall-bladder, and which I
have had the opportunity to ascertain by actual puncture in an
individual not anaesthetized, is in some instances supported by a
general state of lowered acuteness of perception.There are great
differences in respect to readiness of appreciation and promptness of
response to all kinds of excitation in different individuals.To what
cause soever we may ascribe the lack of sensibility, the fact remains
that in not a few cases of gall-stones in the gall-bladder there are no
symptoms to indicate their presence.On the other hand, there are some
disturbances that have a certain significance.[Footnote 168: Amongst the numerous examples of this kind to be found
recorded may be mentioned the case reported by M. L. Garnier, Agrege a
la Faculte de Medecine de Nancy (_Archives de Physiologie normale et
pathologique_, No.176): An hepatic calculus, weighing 24.5
grammes, was discharged without any symptoms or even consciousness on
the part of the patient, a man of sixty years.He had had colic and
jaundice, but these subsided entirely, and there was no further
disturbance.As has happened in so many instances, this stone must have
ulcerated through into the bowel without causing any recognizable
symptoms.]The subjective signs are uneasiness--a deep-seated sensation of
soreness--felt in the right hypochondrium, increased by taking a full
inspiration and by decubitus on the left side.Pain or soreness,
sometimes an acute pain, is experienced under the scapula near the
angle, at or about the acromion process, and sometimes at the nape of
the neck.In one case under my observation within the past year a
patient who had had several attacks of hepatic colic, the usual
polyangular stones having been recovered, had from time to time severe
pain over the right side of the neck, shoulder, and scapula,
accompanied by a severe herpes zoster in the district affected by the
pain.This is of course an extreme example, but it is very suggestive
of the relation which may exist between hepatic disturbances and
shingles.Attacks of gastric pain coming on some time after food, and
not soon after, as is the case in true gastralgia, are usual in the
early stage of the disease--are constant, according to Cyr,[169] who
quotes approvingly an observation of Leared on this point.Migraine
{1070} or sick headache and vertigo occur in many cases, but it may
well be doubted whether these symptoms are not due to the accompanying
gastro-duodenal catarrh, which is a nearly constant symptom.Acidity,
flatulence, epigastric oppression, a bitter taste, a muddy rather
bilious complexion, and constipation are symptoms belonging to catarrh
of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane.Some additional information may be supplied by
palpation.When the gall-bladder is distended with gall-stones, or is
in the enlarged state which occurs when the common duct is obstructed,
it may project beneath the inferior border of the liver far enough to
be felt.In thin persons a grating sound, produced by the friction of
the calculi, may be heard, the stethoscope being applied as palpation
is made over the hypochondrium.It is rare that these symptoms can be
elicited, since the calculous affection of the liver occurs for the
most part in persons of full habit, in whom the abdominal walls are too
thick to allow of the necessary manipulation.There may be also some
tenderness on pressure along the inferior margin of the ribs,
especially in the region of the gall-bladder.[Footnote 169: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE MIGRATION OF GALL-STONES BY THE NATURAL
CHANNELS.--A calculus passing into the cystic duct from the
gall-bladder causes the disturbance known as hepatic colic or bilious
colic, because of the jaundice which accompanies the major part of
these seizures.But jaundice is not a necessary element in these cases;
it is not until the concretion reaches the common duct that the passage
of bile into the intestine is interfered with.The gall-bladder has a
function rather conservative than essential, for its duct may be
permanently closed without apparently affecting the health.The time when an attack of hepatic colic is most likely to occur would
seem to be determined by the flow of bile; for this, as has been
stated, is the chief factor in moving calculi along the ducts.As, no
doubt, the presence of the chyme in the duodenum is the stimulus for
the production of bile and also for the contractions of the
gall-bladder, it follows that a few hours after meals is the time when
the attacks of hepatic colic would a priori be expected.This is in
accord with experience, but there are exceptions.In one of the most
formidable cases with which the writer has had to deal--the diagnosis
confirmed by the recovery of the calculi--the most severe attacks
occurred in the early morning.According to Harley,[170] colic from the
passage of inspissated bile occurs when the stomach and duodenum are
most nearly empty--from ten at night until ten in the morning--and this
he relies on as a means of diagnosis, but the exceptions are too
numerous to assign much importance to this circumstance.[Footnote 170: _On Diseases of the Liver_, p.The onset of pain is usually sudden, but it may develop slowly from a
vague uneasiness in the region of the gall-bladder; or after some pain
and soreness at this point, accompanied by nausea, even vomiting, the
paroxysm will begin with very acute pain.The situation of the pain is
by no means constant, and usually varies in position in the same case.The point of maximum intensity is near the ensiform cartilage, outward
and downward two or three inches, about the point of junction of the
cystic and common duct.From or about this region the pain radiates
through the epigastrium, the right hypochondrium, upward into the
chest, {1071} backward under the scapula, and downward and inward
toward the umbilicus.In some instances under my observation the most
acute suffering was located in the right iliac region, in others in the
lumbar region, and in still others in the epigastrium.The position of
the pain may be such as to draw attention from the liver, and thus
greatly confuse the diagnosis.In a well-defined attack the pain is
intense, shooting, and boring, irregularly paroxysmal; the patient
writhes in agony, screams and groans, rolls from side to side, or walks
partly bent, holding the part with a gentle pressure or rubbing with an
agonized tension of feeling.Meanwhile the countenance is expressive of
the intensest suffering, is pallid and drawn, and the body is covered
with a cold sweat.Nausea presently supervenes, and with the efforts to
vomit a keen thrust of pain and a sense of cramp dart through the
epigastrium and side.Very considerable depression of the vital powers
occurs; the pulse becomes small, feeble, and slow, or very rapid and
feeble.The patient may pass into a condition of collapse, and, indeed,
the pain of hepatic colic may cause death by sudden arrest of the
heart's action.The cases which prove fatal in this way are doubtless
examples of fatty heart, the degeneration of the cardiac muscle being a
result of the action of the same factors as those which cause
gall-stones to form, if the relation of general steatosis to these
bodies which I have set forth prove to be true.The pain is not
continuously so violent as above expressed: it remits from time to
time, and seems about to cease altogether when a sudden access of
anguish is experienced and the former suffering is renewed, and, it may
be, more savagely than before.The pain of an attack of hepatic colic
has no fixed duration.It will depend on the size of the calculus, on
the point where impacted, and on the impressionability of the subject.The severity of the seizures varies within very wide limits.The attack
may consist in a transient colic-like pain, in a mere sense of
soreness, in epigastric uneasiness with nausea, or it may be an agony
sufficient to cause profound depression of the powers of life--to
destroy life, indeed.The usual attack of hepatic colic is one in which
severe suffering is experienced until relief is obtained by the
exhibition of anodynes.Under these circumstances the subsidence of the
pain may be rather gradual or it may be sudden: in the former case, as
the effects of the anodyne are produced, we may suppose that the spasm
subsides and the stone moves onward, at last dropping into the
intestine: an enchanting sense of relief is at once experienced.Very
serious nervous disturbances may accompany the pain.Paroxysms of
hysteria may be excited in the hysterical; convulsions occur in those
having the predisposition to them from any cause, and in the epileptic.The onset of a severe seizure is announced by chilliness, sometimes by
a severe chill.Now and then the paroxysms commence with the chill, and
the pain follows.It occasionally happens that the attacks in respect
to the order in which the symptoms occur, and in their regularity as to
time, behave like an ordinary ague.In fact, there appear to be two
modes or manifestations of the attacks of hepatic colic in malarious
localities: those in which the phenomena are merely an outcome of the
passage of the calculi; those in which an attack of intermittent fever
is excited by the pain and disturbance of hepatic colic.To the first
Charcot[171] {1072} has applied the phrase fievre intermittente
hepatique.It is supposed to correspond pathogenetically to urethral
fever produced by the passage of a catheter.On the other hand, the
second form of intermittent can occur only under the conditions
producing ague.A calculus passing in a subject affected with chronic
malarial poisoning, the latent malarial influence is aroused into full
activity, and the resulting seizure is compounded of the two factors.The truly malarial form of calculus fever differs from the traumatic in
its regular periodicity and the methodical sequence of the attacks,
which occur in the order of an intermittent quotidian or tertian.During the attacks of hepatic colic, when protracted and severe, a
sense of chilliness or distinct chills occur, sometimes with the
regularity of an intermittent; but these differ from the seizures which
the chill inaugurates at distinct times, the intervening period being
free from disturbance.[Footnote 171: _Lecons sur la Maladies du Foie_, p.The fever which accompanies some severe paroxysms of hepatic colic has
a distinctly intermittent character, hence the name applied to it by
Charcot.There are two forms of this calculus fever as it occurs in
malarious localities: one intermittent, coming on during a protracted
case, and immediately connected with and dependent on the passage of
the stone; the other a regular intermittent quotidian or tertian, which
determines and accompanies the paroxysm of colic.A case occurring
under my observation very recently, in which these phenomena were
exhibited and the calculi recovered, proves the existence of such a
form of the malady.In this case with the onset of the pain a severe
chill occurred; then the fever rose, followed by the sweat, during
which the pain ceased, but much soreness and tenderness about the
region of the gall-bladder, and jaundice, followed in the usual way.At
the so-called septenary periods also attacks come on in accordance with
the usual laws of recurrence of malarial fevers.In many instances, probably a
majority, the pulse is not accelerated, rather slowed, and the
temperature does not rise above normal.The inflammation which follows
an attack of hepatic colic will be accompanied by some elevation of the
body-heat, and fever will occur when ulceration of the duct and
perforation cause a local peritonitis; but these conditions are quite
apart from those which obtain in the migration of calculi by the
natural channel.Nausea and vomiting are invariable symptoms of hepatic colic.First the
contents of the stomach are brought up, then some glairy mucus only,
with repeated and exhausting straining efforts; and with the sudden
cessation of the pain there may appear in the vomit a quantity of
bilious matter, the contents of the gall-bladder liberated by the
passage of the stone into the intestine.If bile is present in the
vomit from the beginning, it may be concluded that the obstruction is
not complete.The abdomen may be distended with gas--is
usually, indeed, when constipation exists.Free purgation gives great
relief.The stools are composed of scybalae chiefly at first, afterward
of a brownish offensive liquid, and when jaundice supervenes they
become whitish in color, pasty, and semi-solid.Now and then it happens
that a copious movement of the bowels takes place as the attack is
impending, but during the paroxysm no action occurs.Jaundice is an important, but not an invariable, symptom.It comes on
within the first twenty-four hours succeeding the paroxysm, and appears
{1073} first in the conjunctiva, thence spreading over the body
generally.The intensity of the jaundice depends on the amount of the
obstruction: if complete, the body is intensely yellow; and if partial,
the tint may be very light.The very slight degree of obstruction which
suffices to determine the flow of bile backward has been already
stated.There may be no jaundice, although all the other symptoms of
the passage of gall-stones may be present.Such is the state of the
case when a calculus enters and is arrested in the cystic duct.Under
these circumstances the natural history differs from that which obtains
when the obstruction is in the common duct and ends abruptly by the
discharge of the calculus into the intestine.After the persistence of
the symptoms of hepatic colic for a variable period without jaundice,
this sign of obstruction may appear, indicating the removal of the
stone from the cystic into the common duct.The symptoms accompanying
the jaundice--the hebetude of mind, the slow pulse, the itching of the
skin, the dark- urine--have been sufficiently detailed in the
section on that topic in another part of this article.The duration of the jaundice is different in different cases, and is
influenced by the degree and persistence of the obstruction.When the
obstruction is partial and the stone is soon removed, the jaundice will
be slight and will disappear in a day or two; on the other hand, when
the stone completely blocks the passage and is slowly dislodged, the
jaundice will be intense and will persist for ten days to two weeks.After the paroxysm has passed, if severe, the liver will be swollen,
more or less tenderness will be developed by pressure, and in some
instances, a local peritonitis coming on, there will occur the usual
symptoms of that condition.Although all the symptoms produced by the passage of biliary calculi
may be present, some uncertainty will always be felt unless the body
causing the disturbance is recovered from the feces.A
properly-conducted search is therefore necessary.As this is so often
done inefficiently and the calculus not found, an error of diagnosis
may seem to have occurred.Every stool should be examined in the mode
hereinafter described for a number of days after the attack until the
calculus is found.It should be remembered that only air-dried calculi
float on water.The stool, as soon as passed, should be slowly stirred
up in water sufficient to make a thin mixture, and all solid particles
removed for further examination, the thinner portion poured off, and
more water added from time to time until only solids remain at last.It
should not be forgotten that masses of inspissated bile, biliary sand,
may produce symptoms not unlike those due to gall-stones proper, and
hence all particles having the appearance of this material should be
examined chemically.Place some of the supposed bile on a white plate
and pour over it some drops of strong sulphuric acid, when the
biliverdin will take on a brilliant scarlet color.The discharge of particles of inspissated bile causes symptoms not
unlike those due to the migration of biliary calculi, but there are
points of difference.A strongly-marked case diagnosticated biliary
calculi, and in which masses of inspissated bile were discharged in
great quantity, will furnish the symptomatology to be now described.The onset of the paroxysms of pain is less abrupt than is the case with
gall-stones, and the attacks may occur at any time; the pain also
subsides more gradually, and hardly {1074} ceases at any time, but
revives every now and then, so that several days, even weeks, may be
occupied with one seizure.Jaundice is less apt to follow, and indeed
well-defined jaundice rarely occurs in this affection.There is much
swelling of the liver, also considerable tenderness, and relief is most
certainly afforded by free purgation, anodynes seeming rather to keep
up the disturbance, probably by checking the hepatic secretions.Attacks of hepatic colic may be expected to recur when a calculus with
multiple facets migrates, but the time when its associates may be
expected to move cannot be predicated on any data now available.Single
attacks may happen at intervals of weeks, months, or years.The
migration of one large stone may so dilate the ducts as to facilitate
the passage of those that remain behind, thus ensuring a recurrence of
the seizures at an early period.IMPACTION OF CALCULI AND MIGRATION BY ARTIFICIAL ROUTES.--The point at
which impaction takes place is an element of great importance.The size
of the calculus is far from being decisive as to the certainty of
impaction or as to the untoward results.A not unfrequent accident is
the blocking of the cystic duct at its opening, thus preventing the
influx or outgo of bile from the gall-bladder.If the stone does not
ulcerate through, in this position it does no damage, for the
gall-bladder, as has been stated, may be closed without any apparent
detriment.Just at the bend of the cystic duct, near its origin, is the
point where arrest of a calculus is most likely to take place.The next
most likely point is the duodenal end of the common duct.When
impaction occurs a local inflammation comes on, an exudation is poured
out, ulceration begins, and presently the peritoneum is reached.Adhesions usually form with the neighboring organs, but now and then
perforation takes place, and bile, pus, and the calculus are
precipitated into the peritoneal cavity.A fatal peritonitis follows,
as a rule; but rarely the inflammation is localized, and an abscess
forms which pursues the usual course of such accumulations; or
adhesions may take place about the site of the perforation and prevent
a general inflammation of the peritoneum.In this way a very large sac
may be produced, with the ultimate result of rupture into the general
cavity, although a fistulous communication may be established with some
neighboring organ, permitting safe discharge in this direction.A gall-stone impacted in one of the hepatic ducts or in the main duct,
ulcerating through, may form an abscess not distinguishable from other
solitary hepatic abscesses except by the presence of the concretion
causing the mischief and the absence of the usual conditions giving
rise to these accumulations of pus.It is probable that fatal abscesses
of the liver not infrequently are caused in this way in extra-tropical
countries.Adhesions forming to neighboring hollow organs or to the
external integument, such abscesses discharge, carrying out the
calculus with them.In this way may be explained the discharge by the
intestine of calculi much too large to have passed by the natural route
and unattended by the usual symptoms of hepatic colic.These
gastro-intestinal biliary fistulae extend from the gall-bladder and the
larger ducts to the stomach, to the duodenum, and to the transverse
colon; but of these the communication with the stomach is the least
common.The adhesion of the gall-bladder or common duct to the duodenum
or colon may be direct, exudations uniting {1075} the two parts without
the intervention of an abscess cavity, or such a sac or cavity may be
interposed.In some cases the discharge of biliary calculi is effected
through these routes with so little disturbance as to escape notice, or
the symptoms may be only vague indications of a local inflammation in
the neighborhood of the liver.Biliary fistulae communicating externally, caused by the migration of
calculi, are comparatively common.They have the clinical history, and
are usually treated as cases, of hepatic abscess.Sometimes hundreds of
calculi are thus discharged.In such instances it may be assumed that
communication has been established with the gall-bladder.Hepatic
abscess thus due to the migration of calculi may discharge into the
pelvis of the kidney, into the ascending vena cava, or through the
lung, but these places of outlet are comparatively uncommon.COURSES AND COMPLICATIONS.--Although symptoms cease for the time being
when the calculus passes into the duodenum, and although in most
instances no after unpleasant effects are experienced, there are cases
in which the presence of the concretion in the intestine proves to be
fruitful of mischief.Calculi of very large size--from a pigeon's to a
hen's egg--are also found in the intestine, without the occurrence of
symptoms indicative of their migration.It has been shown that this
silent migration of calculi from the liver-passages to the intestinal
is not uncommon.Hepatic concretions are distinguishable from the
intestinal by their crystalline form and by their composition.The
former are usually polyangular, and are composed of cholesterin
crystallized about a nucleus of bile-pigment, inspissated bile, or
mucus.After entrance into the intestine, lime salts and mucus are
deposited in successive layers, so that the form of the calculus is
modified and its size increased.The solitary ovoid concretion is most
frequently found in the intestine, without previous symptoms of hepatic
source, and, although increased in size in the intestine, it retains
its original shape.A specimen of this kind now in my possession
illustrates these points.It is composed of cholesterin crystallized in
radiating lines and concentric rings about a central nucleus of
inspissated bile.Around the hepatic concretion there have formed
layers of lime and mucus since it has reached the intestine, and after
drying this rind became brittle and was readily detached.The
polyangular calculus is apt to form the nucleus of a scybala-like mass
of feces; hence in the search for these bodies every such mass should
be broken up.An example of this has recently come under my own
observation.Concretions of all sizes, having reached the intestines,
as a rule pass down without creating any commotion, and are silently
discharged.Obstruction of the bowels is one of the results.A great may cases have
been collected by Murchison,[172] as many more by Leichtenstern,[173]
of impaction of the intestine produced by an accumulation of feces
about a biliary concretion.A calculus may be retained in a fold or
diverticulum of the small intestine, and may indeed cause a loop to be
formed which in turn readily twists, becoming an immovable obstruction.This mode of obstructing the bowels is less common than the simple
impaction.It is affirmed by some authorities, especially by Von
Schuppel, that obstruction of the bowels--impaction--is more often
caused by stones that have ulcerated through into the {1076} intestines
than by those that have descended by the common duct; and this
conclusion must be reached if jaundice has not been present.It is not
only the size of the calculus which determines impaction, as has been
stated: several may be agglutinated in one mass, and reflex spasm of
the muscular layer may be induced by their presence in the bowel.Nevertheless, some enormous concretions have been found in the canal,
and others have been discharged without special trouble.Hilton Fagge
exhibited to the Pathological Society[174] of London two gall-stones
passed with the stools, measuring 2-1/2 by 1-1/5 inches in long and
short diameter, and Fauconneau-Dufresne[175] refers to concretions of
the size of a hen's egg.Mention has been made of one in the writer's
possession of the size of a pullet's egg, which, until its discharge,
caused a train of characteristic symptoms.These immense bodies may
have ulcerated through from the gall-bladder or may have grown by
successive deposits of carbonate and phosphate of lime after reaching
the intestine.[Footnote 172: _Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, p.[Footnote 173: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 174: _Transactions of the London Pathological Society_, vol.cit._]

The symptoms caused by the presence of concretions in the intestines
are, when pronounced, sufficiently characteristic.At a variable period
after an attack or attacks of hepatic colic the disturbance begins.The
condition of impaction above referred to does not differ from ordinary
fecal accumulation.It is true that occasionally the intestinal
irritation due to the presence of these bodies in some instances
preceded the symptoms of impaction, but usually there is no evidence to
indicate that the stoppage of the bowel is due to anything else than
feces.The irritability manifested by the intestinal mucous membrane
when gall-stones are present varies remarkably.There may be only some
ill-defined pain which, as a rule, indicates the position of the
calculus, or it may be pain with a feeling of soreness, or it may take
the form of violent colic, with nausea, vomiting, and depression.In my
own cases pain was experienced at or near the ileo-caecal valve, where
one was lodged, and along the descending colon, where the others were;
the pain and soreness ceased when these bodies were discharged.In a few instances gall-stones are brought up by vomiting.The most
remarkable example of this is a case to be found in the _Transactions
of the Pathological Society_ (vol.129): A woman ninety-four
years of age vomited a stone the size of a nutmeg.In the reported
examples violent pain, nausea, and much vomiting preceded the discharge
of the calculus.Like other foreign bodies, a gall-stone may ulcerate through the
intestine, producing fatal peritonitis.Many conditions due to the presence of biliary concretions, and which
arise during their migrations, may be viewed as complications.Many of
those produced directly have been described as a part of the proper
course of the malady; others are local and reflex, and these may with
propriety be considered as complications.First in importance are those
due to obstruction and the local inflammation.The passage of a calculus along the duct excites an inflammation of the
mucous membrane, which by contiguity of tissue invades the peritoneal
layer if the stone is retained for a sufficient time, and especially if
it is immovably lodged.The stoppage in the flow of bile leads to
dilatation of the ducts, and a change takes place in the character of
that fluid, {1077} owing to the admixture of mucus with the bile and to
the pouring out of a pathological secretion: it loses the bilious
appearance and becomes a merely sero-purulent fluid.Serious changes
ensue in the structure of the liver, as was first suggested by O. Wyss
and Leyden, and afterward more especially by Wickham Legg[176] and
Charcot.[177] A ligature to the common duct in animals is followed in
so short a time as two weeks by hyperplasia of the connective tissue
and atrophy of the gland-elements.It has been ascertained that similar
changes ensue in man from the impaction of a calculus in the common
duct.Under these circumstances the size of the liver, as indicated by
the area of hepatic dulness, at first enlarges, and subsequently more
or less contraction, coincident with the atrophy, ensues.When the
cystic duct is obstructed the contents of the gall-bladder increase,
and become ultimately sero-purulent (dropsy).In some instances, the
walls of the abdomen being thin, a globular elastic tumor may be felt
projecting from beneath the liver.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports for 1873_.See also
_Treatise on Diseases of the Liver_, by the same author, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 177: _Lecons_.]Angiocholitis, or inflammation of the duct, is caused by the passage,
especially by the impaction, of a calculus.The inflammation may extend
by contiguity of tissue and involve the surrounding parts.Several
cases have been examined by the writer in which the gall-bladder and
the cystic and common duct were imbedded in a mass of organized
exudation.An extension of inflammation may take place, and be confined
to the hepatic peritoneum.Heavy organized exudations will form,
adhesions be contracted to the diaphragm, to the parietal peritoneum,
and to the neighboring organs, and the capsule, thickened and
contracting, will ultimately induce changes in the structure of the
adjacent part of the liver.When the inflammation extends to the
peritoneum there are the usual systemic symptoms, and locally acute
pain, increased by the respiratory movements and by pressure, and
assuming a constrictive character; nausea and frequent vomiting, and
often a very troublesome hiccough, caused, doubtless, by implication of
some branches of the phrenic nerve; constipation, etc.The relation of biliary colic to cancer of the biliary passages was
first noted by Frerichs, who ascertained the occurrence of gall-stones
in 9 out of 11 cases of cancer of these parts.Hilton Fagge[178]
reports a case of the kind, and the writer can add another from his own
observations.The most important of the reflex symptoms are those pertaining to the
circulatory system.The action of the heart becomes irregular in rhythm
and diminishes in force.The circulation of the bile acids in the blood
causes slowing of the heart's action, as has been set forth in the
section on jaundice; but that is a direct consequence, and is not a
reflex impression.Potain was the first to show that the structure of
the heart is affected.A mitral murmur is a recognized symptom in the
icterus of gall-stones, but Potain[179] has shown that the real seat of
this murmur is the tricuspid, and that the affection of the heart is a
dilatation of the right cavities.The physiological reason for this
condition of the heart is the rise of tension in the pulmonary artery,
which is secondary to irritation of the splanchnic nerves; and to this
factor is also due the reduplication of the first sound and the
accentuation of the second sound--characteristic signs of the cardiac
change in these cases.[Footnote 179: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affec.cit._]

{1078} There are certain reflex nervous troubles in cases of hepatic
colic, some of them of great importance.One of the lesser troubles is
herpes zoster.A very violent attack in the course of the distribution
of the first, second, and third cervical nerves has happened in a case
under the writer's observation.There have been reported from time to
time cases of sudden death during the paroxysms of hepatic colic, in
which a calculus lodged in Vater's diverticulum, at the intestinal
extremity of the common duct, was the cause of the accident.An
explanation of this result is to be found in the intimate nervous
communications between the liver and the heart through the solar plexus
and the large number of ganglia contained in Vater's diverticulum.The
most severe pain is felt as the calculus is passing through the orifice
of the common duct into the intestine, and here also the spasm of the
muscular fibre is most tense.The so-called crushing-blow experiment of
Goltz illustrates how intense suffering, such as the passage of a
gall-stone, can paralyze the heart through the solar plexus.The
depression of the heart's action does not always occur on the instant,
but it may be gradual--several hours, even a day or two, being occupied
in the suspension of activity.Leigh of Liverpool[180] has reported an
example of death in six hours in a female of thirty, previously in good
health; Cornillon,[181] another in a female of fifty-three, who died in
twelve hours from the beginning of the paroxysm; Williamson,[182] a
female of fifty-one years, who expired on the fourth day;
Habershon,[183] two, who died during the paroxysms at a period not
stated; and Brouardel, one which was the subject of a medico-legal
investigation.In the first case the calculus was yet in the
gall-bladder, the appearances indicating that persistent spasms had
occurred to force the calculus into the cystic duct; in the others in
which the position of the stone is mentioned, it was engaged in the
orifice of the common duct or had reached the intestine.[Footnote 180: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1867, vol.[Footnote 182: _The Lancet_ (London), vol.[Footnote 183: _Lectures on the Pneumogastric_, 3d Lecture.]In several instances sudden death has resulted from uncontrollable
vomiting induced by the paroxysms of hepatic colic.Trousseau[184]
mentions a case in which strangulated hernia and death ensued in
consequence of the violent vomiting brought on by the passage of a
calculus.[Footnote 184: _Clinique medicale_.]DIAGNOSIS.--Unless the distension of the gall-bladder is sufficient to
cause a recognizable tumor, gall-stones in that organ do not produce
symptoms by which they can be diagnosticated.If sudden attacks of
violent pain in the right hypochondrium, accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and followed by jaundice, have occurred from time to time,
then the presence of biliary concretions may be suspected if the
symptoms belonging to them are present in the intervals between the
seizures.The migrations of calculi produce symptoms so characteristic
that error is hardly possible.The only disorders with which an attack
of hepatic colic may be confounded are gastralgia and hepatalgia.As
regards the first, the distinction is made by the seat of pain, by the
absence of after jaundice, and by the lack of a concretion passed by
stool.As the diagnosis may depend on the finding a concretion, the
writer must again affirm the importance of a properly-conducted search
of all the stools passed for several days after the paroxysm.{1079} Hepatalgia is diagnosticated with great difficulty, for the pain
has the same seat, the same character, but as a rule it does not
terminate so abruptly, is not accompanied by such severe vomiting and
depression, jaundice is absent, and no stone can be found in the
evacuations.Both gastralgia and hepatalgia occur in the subjects of
neurotic disturbances--in the pale, delicate, and hysterical--whereas,
as a rule, hepatic colic happens to the obese, to the persons of active
digestion addicted to the pleasures of the table.The passage of calculi may be confounded with flatulent colic, with the
pain caused by lead and other mineral poisons, with impaction, internal
strangulation, local peritonitis, and similar causes of sudden and
violent pain.The differentiation is made by attention to the seat and
character of the pain, by the previous history, and especially by the
absence of jaundice and of a concretion.From renal colic the hepatic
is separated by the position of the pain, by the direction taken by it,
and by the retraction of the testicle, the irritability of the bladder,
and the appearance of blood in the urine--all characteristic symptoms
of the renal affection.TREATMENT.--The treatment of biliary concretions includes the remedial
management for the calculi in position, for the paroxysms of hepatic
colic caused by the migration of these bodies, and for the results and
complications.Treatment of the Calculus State: Of Inspissated Bile.--As the particles
of inspissated bile are deposited along the larger hepatic ducts, and
form in consequence of a deficiency in the amount of glycocholate and
taurocholate of soda, two methods of treatment are to be carried out:
free purgation by an active cholagogue to wash out the offending
substance, and the exhibition of a soda salt to promote the alkalinity
of the bile and the consequent solution of the bile-pigment.Harley's
method, which he strongly urges, consists in the administration of "one
or two drachms of sulphate of soda in a bitter infusion every morning
before breakfast, or from twenty to thirty grains of bicarbonate of
soda, along with a drachm of taraxacum-juice in a bitter infusion,
every night at bedtime at regulated intervals for a month or so,
according to the constitution of the patient and the severity of the
symptoms."As persons who suffer from inspissation of the bile are naturally
bilious, it is of the first importance in the prophylactic treatment to
regulate the diet.Indulgence in malt liquors, in fatty and saccharine
articles of food, must be forbidden.Acid fermentation in the course of
duodenal digestion should be prevented by withholding the starches and
sugars.Peptonized foods, given with an alkali, are highly useful.Milk, fresh meat, and the succulent vegetables are the proper
constituents of a diet for these subjects.Bread is one of the most
offending articles, and should be restricted in amount as much as
possible.Next to a suitable diet, systematic exercise is a measure of the
highest utility in these cases.A daily morning sponge bath of a weak
alkaline water not only maintains the skin in a healthy state, but also
promotes the oxidation processes of the body.The alkaline mineral
waters of Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, and other States, especially
of the Bethesda Spring of Wisconsin, may be drunk with great advantage
to accomplish the same purpose.{1080} We possess direct means for preventing inspissation of the
bile--remedies which act in the physiological way by increasing the
proportion of glycocholate and taurocholate of soda.Harley prefers the
sulphate and bicarbonate for this purpose, but my experience is in
favor of the cholate and phosphate of sodium, especially the latter;
for, whilst it plays the part of a soda salt, it exerts a decided
cholagogue action, thus effecting the results achieved by the combined
use of sulphate of soda and taraxacum.A cure may be confidently looked
for in this malady by the persistent use of sodium phosphate--drachm j
ter in die.It seems to act more efficiently when given dissolved in
hot water.The paroxysms of hepatic colic due to the passage of inspissated bile
are to be treated in the same way as when this condition of things is
caused by the migration of formed calculi.The action of cholagogue
purgatives is more decidedly beneficial in the attacks due to the
passage of inspissated bile.Biliary Calculi in Situ.--Notwithstanding their crystalline form and
firmness of texture, it is possible to effect the gradual solution of
biliary calculi.Outside of the body it is easy to dissolve a calculus
in chloroform, in Durande's remedy, etc., if time enough be given, but
the problem is a far more difficult one when the calculus is in
position in the gall-bladder or in a hepatic duct.As Trousseau[185]
has wisely observed, it is not safe to apply to conditions within the
body conclusions reached by experiments in the laboratory.Nevertheless, facts are known which justify the belief that an
impression may be made on concretions in the gall-bladder.The motion
of respiration and the voluntary actions of the abdominal muscles cause
more or less attrition and breaking off of the angles and margins of
the crystals, thus permitting the solvent action of the bile.If,
however, the bile continues in the state in which it was at the time of
the crystallization of the cholesterin, it will make no impression on
this substance.We have now the means of restoring its power to
dissolve crystallized cholesterin.As a necessary preliminary, fracture
of the crystals must be effected.This may be accomplished, when the
natural forces have failed to effect it, by manipulation of the
gall-bladder through the walls of the abdomen, but especially by
faradization.Excellent results have been achieved by this
last-mentioned expedient, but no satisfactory explanation has been made
of its methodus medendi, unless we accept the mechanical effect of the
muscular movements.In applying the faradic current an electrode is
introduced into the rectum, and the other, a sponge well moistened, is
placed over the gall-bladder.An interrupted galvanic current is
indicated, the electrodes in the position just mentioned, when a
migrating calculus is stopped on its way.Such an application has
rendered important service in a few cases.[Footnote 185: _Clinique medicale de l'Hotel Dieu de Paris_.]Except that calculi have been found in a state of decay, their angles
and edges broken, divided by cleavage, there is no evidence that they
have undergone solution when in situ, except the clinical evidence
which consists in a disappearance of the symptoms.The remedy of
Durande, which consists in a mixture of ether and turpentine--three
parts of the former and two of the latter--has been celebrated since
the close of the last century, and is yet much employed in France,
notably at Vichy.It {1081} is preferred by Cyr,[186] who advises its
administration in capsules taken immediately before meals.Chloroform
readily dissolves calculi out of the body, and hence it has been
proposed, and indeed much used, for the purpose of effecting their
solution in the gall-bladder; but, as Trousseau urges, there is no
warrant for the belief.Corlieu,[187] who first proposed its use, and
afterward Bouchut,[188] maintained that chloroform does exert this
solvent action, and reported cases in confirmation; but there are so
many sources of fallacy that such evidence must be viewed with
suspicion.It has usually been administered in small doses (five
minims) three times a day for a long period.That it is beneficial by
stimulating the flow of pancreatic secretion and by allaying spasms is
probably true, but that any quantity which can be administered in
safety will act as a solvent of cholesterin concretions cannot be
believed.[Footnote 186: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 187: _Gazette des Hopitaux_, 1856, June 19.][Footnote 188: _Bulletin gen.If solution of hepatic calculi is possible under any circumstances, the
most rational mode of effecting it would seem to be to restore that
condition of the bile which in the normal state maintains cholesterin
in the state of solution.Cholesterin is precipitated and crystallizes
about a nucleus when the glycocholate and taurocholate of soda are
deficient in amount.The agents most effective in restoring the solvent
power of the bile are the salts of soda, of which the sulphate is
preferred by Harley.In 1873 the cholate of soda was brought forward by
Schiff, who prescribed it in doses of 50 centigrammes (8 grains nearly)
three times a day, to be gradually increased until digestive or
circulatory troubles arose.This remedy, which is eminently rational
from the point of view above indicated, has apparently been of decided
service in many published cases and in the writer's experience.It will
be found, however, that five grains three times a day is as large a
quantity as can be easily borne.Another soda salt which in my own hands has proved in a high degree
effective is the phosphate.As has been explained when referring to its
use in cases of disorders due to inspissated bile, it has a distinct
cholagogue action, but the chief sources of its utility in this
affection are its chemical and resolvent powers.The usual quantity is
one drachm three times a day, dissolved in sufficient warm water.Bile itself, in the form of inspissated ox-gall, was formerly much
used, a scruple to a drachm being given three times a day, and not
without good results.It was also prescribed with chloride of ammonium.For the gastro-duodenal catarrh and the accompanying catarrh of the
bile-ducts this combination is sometimes useful.I have recently proposed a new expedient for effecting the solution of
hepatic calculi.This method consists in puncture of the gall-bladder
with a fine exploring-trocar, and the injection through the canula,
after withdrawing the stylet, of a suitable solvent.Durande's remedy,
chloroform, and other solvents can be introduced in this way without
injury to the parts.I have punctured the gall-bladder, removed its
contents, and explored its interior without damaging the organ in any
way and without leaving after traces.The measure proposed offers no
special difficulties in its execution.The Paroxysms of Hepatic Colic.--The pain of hepatic colic being {1082}
the most acute suffering known to man--in its severest form at
least--the most powerful anodynes are required.The measures employed
for relief of pain happen to be the most efficient for promoting the
expulsion of the calculus and for limiting, if not preventing, the
subsequent inflammation.As soon as the character of the seizure is
manifest a hypodermatic injection of morphine and atropine--1/8 to 1/2
grain of the former and 1/200 to 1/80 grain of the latter--should be
given; ether administered by inhalation if necessary; and by the
stomach chloroform, chlorodyne, or chloral.As the stomach is usually
exceedingly irritable, the subcutaneous injection of remedies is a
precious resource: this failing or contraindicated, relief may be given
by the rectal injection of laudanum or chlorodyne.As relief is often
afforded by the act of vomiting, the attempts to empty the stomach
should be encouraged, and to this end large draughts of warm water
should be given.Hot fomentations and mustard plaster should be applied
over the right hypochondrium, and an entire warm bath may be used if
available.Great relief is usually afforded by the action of purgatives.The
irritability of the stomach forbids the employment of drastic
purgatives, yet podophyllin resin is warmly commended by Dobell.It
must be given in small doses, and preferably dissolved in spirit.Calomel in one-grain doses, every four hours until it purges, allays
nausea and lessens the after-uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, but
mercurial treatment given with a view to a supposed cholagogue effect
only does evil by prolonged administration, especially if ptyalism is
induced.If evidences of portal congestion are present, such remedies
as euonymin, iridin, baptisin, and others of the cholagogue group give
good results.The most effective of the remedies of this kind is
ipecacuanha, given in purgative doses: the emesis induced by it favors
the extrusion of the stone, and the powerful cholagogue effect relieves
the portal congestion.Twenty grains at once, and repeated if need be
in three hours, is a suitable quantity.The various complications which may occur, and the results which follow
the migration of the calculus, require treatment adapted to the
conditions existing, and will be mentioned in the sections devoted to
these topics.Occlusion of the Biliary Passages; Stenosis of the Ductus Communis
Choledochus.DEFINITION.--By occlusion of the biliary passages is meant an
obstruction, internal or external, of the hepatic, cystic, or common
duct.The causes of the obstruction are various, but the results are
quite uniform; hence the term includes a complexus of symptoms of a
very distinctive type.Occlusion may be congenital or acquired: it is
the latter with which we have especially to deal.Stenosis signifies a narrowing which in its extremest form produces a
nearly complete obstruction; when the canal is entirely closed the term
occlusion is applied.Stenosis also may be congenital or acquired.PATHOGENY.--The conditions producing narrowing of a hepatic duct or its
complete obstruction are numerous, and some of them complex in their
relations.As regards the ducts themselves, the interference may {1083}
be entirely within the canal, or it may affect the walls, or it may be
wholly extraneous; as, for example, when a cancer of the pancreas
encroaches on the common duct.It will be convenient to consider the
causes of stenosis and obstruction from these points of view: 1,
internal; 2, of the duct walls; 3, extraneous.The most usual situations for the occurrence of those changes that lead
to occlusion by inflammatory adhesions are the beginning of the cystic
duct, obstruction of which is of little moment, and the end of the
common duct, which finally proves fatal.The passage of a large polyangular calculus may cause such irritation,
abrasion of the epithelium, and subsequent inflammatory exudation as to
effect a direct union of the opposing sides of the canal.This takes
place at the beginning of the cystic duct especially, since, owing to
the spasm of the gall-bladder and the absence of muscular fibres in the
walls of the duct, the stone crushes into, without passing through, the
canal.The inflammatory exudation thus excited may close the duct.Not
unfrequently the gall-bladder, full of calculi, is thus shut off from
the liver permanently.In one instance the writer has seen a calculus
wedged into the orifice of the cystic duct, whilst just beyond the
lumen was permanently obstructed by an organized exudation.Permanent
closure of the cystic duct is of far less consequence than of the
common duct, and may, indeed, be a conservative condition, as in the
case above mentioned, where numerous polyangular calculi may have
migrated, except the closure of the passage.The most usual point of obstruction in the course of the common duct is
the intestinal end, but various processes are employed to effect it.The first in importance is catarrhal inflammation.This seems the more
credible when it is remembered that to a simple catarrh of the mucous
membrane is due the temporary stoppage of the duct, producing jaundice
in much the largest proportion of cases.When the epithelium is
detached and granulations spring up from the basement membrane,
adhesions of the surfaces will readily take place, and the union may be
so complete as that all traces of the duct will disappear.It is
probable that in many, if not in most, of these cases the initial
condition of the canal is that of simple catarrh, the more positive
changes in the mucous membrane arising from peculiarities in the
tissues of the individual affected, or from local injury caused by the
passage of a concretion or irritation of pathological secretions of the
duodenum.Stenosis, and finally occlusion, of the common duct may arise from the
cicatrization of an ulcer.They
may result from catarrhal inflammation of a chronic type, much new
connective-tissue material forming, and in the process of
cicatrization, with the contraction belonging to it, the lumen of the
canal is so far filled up that the passage of bile is effectually
prevented.They may be produced in that state of the tissues which
accompanies certain cachectic and profoundly adynamic conditions, as in
severe typhoid fever.Such ulcers may also be due to the mechanical
injury effected by the migration of a gall-stone.In cicatrizing, a
tight stricture, impermeable to the passage of bile, may result, or the
lumen of the canal be entirely obliterated.In the latter case the duct
itself may disappear and leave no trace.An ulcer situated at the
duodenal end of the common duct and extending into the {1084} duodenum
may also in the process of healing so contract as to render the orifice
impermeable to bile.The same effect may follow the cicatrization of an
ulcer of the duodenum in the immediate vicinity of the orifice of the
common duct.Without the intervention of an ulcer as a means of explaining closure
of the common duct, this accident may be caused by a catarrhal
inflammation which effects denudation of the basement membrane, and
thence union may be produced by the mere contact of the
freshly-granulating surfaces.Congenital occlusion of the bile-ducts or
obstruction occurring in a few days after birth, it is probable, is
effected in this way, but no direct evidence of the process has thus
far been offered.During intra-uterine life, as at any period in
after-life, it seems necessary to the production of such changes that a
peculiar constitutional state must exist; otherwise, such a result
might happen to every case of catarrhal inflammation of the bile-ducts.The extent of the changes is further evidence in the same direction;
for not only are the walls of the duct in permanent apposition and
adhesion, but the duct degenerates into a mere fibrous cord, and in
some instances is nearly, even entirely, obliterated.[189]

[Footnote 189: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.The cystic or common duct--the latter to be chiefly considered--may be
occluded by the retention in its lumen of some foreign body.The
impaction of a biliary calculus has already been repeatedly referred
to, but there are some additional points demanding consideration.The
larger concretions may be stopped in the neck of the gall-bladder;
those small enough to enter the canal may be arrested at its bend
behind the neck, and the very entrance of the cystic duct may be
blocked, as in a case examined by the writer.The hepatic duct is very rarely permanently occluded.As the calibre of
this canal continuously enlarges downward, there is no point at which a
stone is likely to be arrested; nevertheless, it occasionally happens
that such an obstruction does occur.An example has occurred under the
observation of the writer, but the cause was a gunshot wound of the
liver.The most usual, and for very obvious reasons the most important, of the
sites where occlusion occurs is the common duct and at the termination
of the duct in the small intestine, the intestinal orifice.Just behind
and to the right of its orifice the duct is dilated into a fossa--the
diverticulum Vateri; and here concretions of a size to pass along the
common duct are stopped.It is not essential that the stone fit the
canal: it may do so and prevent any bile passing into the duodenum; it
may be a polyangular body, and, though wedged in, leave spaces through
which more or less can slowly trickle.Again, the diverticulum may contain numerous concretions,
which distend the canal greatly, but through the interstices of which
some bile can flow.Other foreign bodies very rarely close the intestinal end of the ductus
communis; thus, for example, a cherry-seed, a plum-seed, a mass of
raisin-seeds, may slip into the orifice after the passage of a
gall-stone has stretched it sufficiently.A much more common cause of
occlusion is an intestinal parasite, which crawls in and is fastened.The common round-worm is the most frequent offender, and much less
often liver-flukes find a lodgment there.{1085} The ductus communis choledochus may be closed by agencies acting
from without.They are various, but the most common are the
carcinomata.Primary cancer of the gall-bladder and gall-ducts,
although not of frequent occurrence, is by no means rare.It develops
in connection with the connective-tissue new formations produced by the
inflammation following the migration of large calculi.A very
instructive example has been examined by the writer.The patient, a
woman aged forty-eight, had had numerous paroxysms of hepatic colic,
and after death, which followed a protracted stage of jaundice by
obstruction, a large ovoid calculus, filling the gall-bladder, was
found, and an extensive organized exudation of inflammatory origin was
the seat of carcinomatous disease involving the cystic and common ducts
and closing the lumen of both.Cancer of the pylorus, of the duodenum,
of the pancreas, of the right kidney, and of the liver itself, not
unfrequently by exterior pressure permanently occlude the common duct.To this category of obstructing causes must be added enlarged lymphatic
glands of the transverse fissure, large fecal accumulations, tumors of
the ovaries and uterus, aneurisms of the abdominal aorta, and
especially aneurism of the hepatic artery, several examples of which
have been reported, and one has occurred in a case seen by the writer.The effects of obstruction are much less important when the cystic duct
is closed.The contents of the gall-bladder accumulate, constituting
the condition known as dropsy of the gall-bladder.A catarrhal state of
the mucous membrane is set up; the muco-pus formed mixes with the bile,
and the mixture undergoes fermentative changes which further alter its
character and impart to it irritating qualities, in consequence of
which the mucous membrane becomes more decidedly inflamed, and a still
more purulent fluid forms, so that ultimately the contents of the
gall-bladder are entirely purulent, and that organ may attain to
enormous size.Instead of a catarrhal inflammation leading to
suppuration, the mucous membrane may pour out serum abundantly, the
biliary contents and mucus disappear by absorption, and finally the
gall-bladder will be moderately distended by a serous-like fluid.No
further disturbance ensues, and the gall-bladder, thus shut off from
participation in the hepatic functions, ceases to give trouble.The results are far different when the obstruction occurs in the
hepatic or common duct, for then the bile can no longer perform its
double function of secretion and excretion--of contributing materials
necessary to digestion and assimilation, and excreting substances whose
removal is necessary to health.The liver continuing to functionate
after closure of the duct is effected, obviously the secretion of bile
continues to accumulate, and the irritation of the mucous membrane
causes a catarrhal state; mucus is poured out, and serum escapes from
the distended vessels.If the hepatic duct only is obstructed, the
dilatation will not involve the cystic duct and gall-bladder, but as
the common duct at its termination is occluded, usually the whole
system of tubes will be affected by the ensuing changes.The
alterations already described as occurring in the gall-bladder take
place in all the hepatic ducts.The bile-elements are absorbed, and the
fluid distending the whole system of hepatic tubes becomes finally a
semi-transparent serum or a very thin sero-mucus, having in bulk a pale
sea-green color.Although an intense jaundice {1086} coexists with the
obstruction, no portion of the bile escapes into the ducts.At the
beginning of the obstruction more or less bile is in the tubes, and
then the fluid will have a distinct biliary character; but as it
accumulates, first the bile-constituents disappear, then the
mucus--which at the outset was formed freely--is absorbed, and at last
only a colorless serum remains.This fluid, which has been examined
chemically by Frerichs, is found to be slightly alkaline, to have only
2 per cent.of solids, and to present no trace of any biliary
constituent.As the fluid accumulates the gall-bladder and ducts
dilate, sometimes to an enormous extent, the fluid they contain
amounting to several pints.The walls of the ducts grow thinner, and
may finally give way with the pressure or from external violence, the
fluid exciting an intense and quickly-fatal peritonitis.Important
changes occur in the structure of the liver also.With the first
retention of bile the liver conspicuously enlarges, and may indeed
attain to twice its normal size, but it subsequently contracts, and may
lessen in as great a degree as it had enlarged.Changes begin in the
glandular structure as pressure is brought to bear on the cells by the
enlarging ducts.The liver-cells become anaemic and the protoplasm
cloudy, but granular and fatty degeneration does not take place.Even
more important as an agency affecting the condition of the hepatic
cells is the hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which ensues very
promptly when an obstruction to the flow of bile arises from any cause,
as has been shown by Legg[190] and Charcot.[191] The liver on section
has a rather dark olive-green color, and is firmer in texture, owing to
the increased development of the connective tissue; the cells are
bile-stained and contain granules of coloring matter and crystals of
bilirubin, and although they are at first not altered in outline,
subsequently more or less atrophy is produced by the contraction of the
newly-formed connective tissue and the pressure made by the dilated
hepatic ducts.[Footnote 190: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.352
_et seq._]

[Footnote 191: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.205 _et
seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms produced by occlusion of the cystic duct are
not sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosticated with any
certainty.When an attack of hepatic colic has slowly subsided without
jaundice, and an elastic tumor, globular or pyriform in shape, has
appeared from under the inferior margin of the liver in the position of
the gall-bladder, dropsy of that organ may then be suspected.As
paracentesis of the gall-bladder may be performed with ease, safety,
and little pain, the diagnosis may be rendered more certain by the use
of the exploring-trocar.Obstruction of the hepatic or common duct is accompanied by symptoms of
a very pronounced and distinctly diagnostic character.Without
referring now to the antecedent symptoms or to those belonging to the
obstructing cause, the complexus of disturbances following the
obstruction is the subject to which our attention must be directed.The
great fact dominating all other considerations is the stoppage of the
bile, whether this has occurred suddenly or slowly.Jaundice begins in
a few hours after the canal is blocked.At first there is yellowness of
the conjunctiva, then diffused jaundice, deepening into the intensest
color in two or three weeks, or, when the obstruction is sudden and
complete, in a few hours.At first the color is the vivid jaundice
tint, a citron or salmon or yellow-saffron hue, but this gradually
loses its bright appearance, grows darker, and passes successively into
a brownish, bronze-like, and ultimately a {1087} dark olive-green,
which becomes the permanent color.Under some moral emotional
influences there may be a sudden change to a brighter tint, lasting a
few minutes, but otherwise the general dark olive-green hue persists
throughout.In a few instances, after some weeks of jaundice, the
abnormal coloration entirely disappears, signifying that the liver is
too much damaged in its proper glandular structure to be in a condition
to produce bile.Such a cessation of the jaundice is therefore of evil
omen.Pruritus, sometimes of a very intense character, accompanies the
jaundice, in most cases appears with it, and in the supposed curable
cases it has persisted after the cessation of the discoloration.The
irritation may become intolerable, destroying all comfort, rendering
sleep impossible, and so aggravating as to induce a highly nervous,
hysterical state.The scratching sets up an inflammation of the skin,
and presently a troublesome eczema is superadded.In some of the cases
a peculiar eruption occurs on the skin and mucous membranes, entitled
by Wilson[192] xanthelasma.It has been carefully studied by Wickham
Legg,[193] who has ascertained the character of the changes occurring
in the affected tissues, and also by Mr.[194] As a rule,
this eruption appears after several months of jaundice, and manifests
itself first on the eyelids, then on the palms of the hands, where it
makes the most characteristic exhibit, and after a time on the lips and
tongue.It occurs in irregular plaques of a yellowish tint slightly
elevated above the general surface, and rarely assumes a tubercular
form.As was shown by Hilton Fagge, xanthelasma occurs more especially
in the milder cases of catarrhal icterus that had been protracted in
duration, but it is also occasionally seen in the jaundice of
obstruction.[Footnote 192: _Diseases of the Skin_, 6th ed., Lond., p.[Footnote 193: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.317
_et seq._]

[Footnote 194: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.According to the stage of the disease during which the examination is
made the liver will be enlarged or contracted; more or less tenderness
may be developed by pressure in the area occupied by the ducts, and a
tumor in a position to effect compression may possibly be detected.The
area of hepatic dulness will be increased in the beginning of all the
cases in which the obstruction is complete, but will remain normal so
long as the flow of bile persists despite the obstruction.When
enlarged, the liver can be felt projecting below the inferior margin of
the ribs, and with it, in most cases, the elastic globular body, the
gall-bladder.The state of the hepatic secretion, and in consequence
the duration of the obstruction, may be ascertained by puncture of the
gall-bladder and withdrawal of some of its contents for examination.The presence of unaltered bile will indicate recent obstruction; of
serum, will prove long-standing interruption of bile-production.The
presence of concretions in the gall-bladder will indicate the character
of the obstructing cause, and an increased amount of bile of a normal
or nearly normal kind will be conclusive evidence that the obstruction
is in the course of the common duct.In a fatal case of permanent
occlusion examined by myself the cystic duct was closed by inflammatory
adhesions and the common duct was stopped up by a calculus.The enlarged area of hepatic dulness will, in a protracted case, not
continue.The proper secreting structure, the hepatic cells, undergo
atrophy, {1088} and the increased connective tissue--to the development
of which enlargement of the organ is mainly due--contracts.The
ultimate result is that the liver becomes sclerosed, and is distinctly
smaller, the area of hepatic dulness diminishing to a greater relative
extent than the area of dulness due to hypertrophic enlargement.The
contraction of the liver goes on at the rate that several months are
required to make the result evident on percussion and palpation.Not
unfrequently, the contraction is too slight to affect the percussion
note of the right hypochondrium, and then, to realize the condition of
the organ, the history and rational signs must be closely studied.Whilst the liver thus varies in size, the gall-bladder remains enlarged
and projects from the under surface of the organ, elastic, globular,
and distinctive.The shrinking of the liver from around it makes the
impression of growing size; it may be increasing, indeed, but more
frequently the enlargement is merely apparent.Whether the liver be enlarging or diminishing in size, its functions
are impaired, or indeed entirely suspended.As the digestive canal
receives the bile immediately on its production, it will be best to
begin with the gastro-intestinal disorders which accompany occlusion of
the bile-ducts.The appetite is either wanting entirely and food is
loathed, or an excessive or canine appetite is experienced.The latter
belongs rather to an early stage of the disorder, and comes on after
the first disturbance of the stomach belonging to the immediate effects
of the occlusion.The former is the result of long-standing
interference with the primary assimilation.The tongue is coated with a
thick yellowish fur, which, drying, is detached in flakes, leaving the
mucous membrane beneath red, raw, fissured, and easily bleeding.The
taste is bitter, and the mouth has a pasty, greasy, and unclean
feeling.There is much thirst, and as a rule the patient experiences a
keen desire for acid drinks and for fresh fruits.The stomach is rather
intolerant of food, and nausea comes on as soon as it enters the
stomach.The mucus and stomach-juice accumulating over night, in the
morning there is much retching and nausea until the acid and rather
foul contents of the organ come up.When food is retained it causes
much distress, gases of decomposition accumulate, distending the
stomach and giving prominence to the epigastrium, and eructations of
offensive gas, with some acid liquid, occur from time to time.Similarly, in the intestines the foods undergo decomposition instead of
normal digestion; gases of putrefaction are evolved, the abdomen
generally is swollen, and flatulent colic results.Very irritating fat
acids are liberated by the decomposition of the fatty constituents of
the food, which, with the acid products of the fermentation occurring
in the starch and sugar of the diet, cause a sensation of heat and
distress through the abdomen.Usually, the bowels are torpid, but in
some cases the stools are relaxed, having the consistence and
presenting somewhat the appearance of oatmeal porridge.They may be
firm, moulded, even hard.The gas discharged and the stools are
offensive, with a carrion-like odor.Sometimes decomposing articles of
food can be detected in the stools by very casual inspection--always,
indeed, when the examination is intimate.An excess of fat is also a
characteristic of the condition induced by occlusion of the ducts,
especially when the pancreatic duct is closed, as does happen in cancer
of the head of the pancreas.{1089} A significant change in the color of the stools takes place.They lose their normal brownish-red tint and become yellowish or
clay- or white, pasty, or grayish.Sometimes the stools are very
dark, tar-like in color and consistence, or more thin like prune-juice,
or in black scybalae.The most usual appearance of the stools in
occlusion is grayish, mush-like, and coarsely granular.The very dark
hue assumed at times or in some cases signifies the presence of blood.A dark tint of the evacuations may be caused by articles of food, as a
greenish hue may be due to the use of spinach; a clay- tint to
the almost exclusive use of milk; a grayish tint to the action of
bismuth; a bilious appearance to the action of rhubarb; and many
others.When the occlusion is partial, although it be permanent,
sufficient bile may descend into the duodenum to color the stools to
the normal tint, and yet all the other signs of obstruction be present.The bile-pigment, not having an outlet by the natural route, by the
intestine, passes into the blood; all the tissues of the body and the
various secretions and excretions, notably the urine, are stained by
it, constituting the appearance known as jaundice or icterus.This
malady has been described (see ante), but it is necessary now to give a
more specialized account of those conditions due more especially to the
prolonged obstruction of the biliary flow.These are a morbid state of
the blood; changes in the kidneys and in the composition of the urine;
a peculiar form of fever known as hepatic intermittent fever; and a
group of nervous symptoms to which has been applied the term cholaemia.It has already been shown that but little pressure is required to
divert the flow of bile from the ducts backward into the blood.Changes
consequently ensue in the constitution of the blood and in the action
of the heart and of the vessels.The bile acids lower the heart's
movements and lessen the arterial tension; hence the pulse is slower,
softer, and feebler than the normal.Should fever arise, this
depressing action of the bile acids is maintained; and hence, although
the temperature becomes elevated, the pulse-rate does not increase
correspondingly.There are exceptions to this, however, in so far that
the heart and arteries are in some instances little affected, but it is
probable under these circumstances that there are conditions present
which induce decomposition of the bile acids.The most important result of the action of the bile on the constitution
of the blood is the hemorrhagic diathesis.Soon after the occlusion
occurs in very young subjects--at a later period in adults--the
occlusion having existed for many months, in some cases only near the
end, the disposition to hemorrhagic extravasations and to hemorrhages
manifests itself.From the surface of the mucous membranes, under the
serous, in the substance of muscles, the hemorrhages occur.Epistaxis,
or nasal hemorrhage, is usually the first to appear, and may be the
most difficult to arrest.The gums transude blood, and wherever
pressure is brought to bear on the integument ecchymoses follow.The
conjunctiva may be disfigured and the eyelids swollen and blackened by
extravasations, and the skin of the cheeks and nose marked by stigmata.Haematemesis sometimes occurs, but the extravasations into the
intestinal canal more frequently--indeed, very constantly--take place
in a gradual manner, and impart to the stools a dark, almost black,
tar-like appearance.In the same way the urine may contain fluid blood
and coagula, or it may have a merely smoky {1090} appearance from
intimate admixture with the blood at the moment of secretion.Both the bile-pigment and bile acids exert an injurious action on the
kidneys.In cases of prolonged obstruction not only are the tissues of
the organ stained by pigment in common with the tissues of the body,
but the epithelium of the tubules, of the straight and convoluted
tubes, are, according to Moebius,[195] infiltrated with pigment.In
consequence of the size and number of the masses of pigment, the tubes
may become obstructed and the secretion of urine much diminished.Other
changes occur, due chiefly to the action of the bile acids, according
to the same authority.These alterations consist in parenchymatous
degeneration.The urine contains traces of albumen in most cases, and,
according to Nothnagel,[196] always casts of the hyaline and granular
varieties stained with pigment.As the alterations in the structure of
the kidneys progress, fatty epithelium is cast off, and thus the
tubules come finally to be much obstructed and the function of the
organ seriously impaired.To cholaemia then are superadded the peculiar
disturbances belonging to retention of the urinary constituents.[Footnote 195: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.[Footnote 196: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.326;
also, Harley, _op.One of the most interesting complications which arises during the
existence of obstruction of the bile-ducts is the form of fever
entitled by Charcot[197] intermittent hepatic fever.Although its
character was first indicated by Monneret,[198] we owe the present
conception of its nature and its more accurate clinical history to
Charcot.As has already been pointed
out, the passage of a gall-stone may develop a latent malarial
infection or a febrile movement comparable to that caused by the
passage of a catheter, and known as urethral fever.Charcot supposes
that true intermittent hepatic fever is septicaemic in character, and
can therefore arise only in those cases accompanied by an angiocholitis
of the suppurative variety--such, for example, as that which follows
the passage of calculi.Illustrative cases of this fever, one of them
confirmed by an autopsy, have been recently reported by E. Wagner,[199]
who is rather inclined to accept Charcot's view of the pathogeny.A
remarkable case has been published by Regnard,[200] in which the
angiocholitis was induced by the extension of echinococcus cysts into
the common duct.Whilst there are some objections to Charcot's theory,
on the whole it is probably true that this intermittent hepatic fever
is produced by the absorption from the inflamed surface of the ducts of
a noxious material there produced.It may be likened to the fever which
can be caused by the injection of putrid pus into the veins of animals.[Footnote 197: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.178 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 198: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 199: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 200: _Gazette med.49, 1873, quoted by Wagner,
_supra_.]Intermittent hepatic fever, as its name implies, is a paroxysmal fever,
having a striking resemblance to malarial fever, but differs from it in
less regularity of recurrence, in the fact that urea is below the
normal amount instead of increased, and in the effect of quinine, which
in the case of malarial fever is curative, but not curative in hepatic
fever.The paroxysms are sometimes quotidian, rarely double quotidian,
tertian, quartan, and even longer, and in the same case all of these
varieties may occur; on {1091} the other hand, there may be entire
regularity of the seizures.The severity of the chill, the maximum
temperature, and the amount of sweating vary within considerable
limits; there may be merely a slight sense of chilliness or a severe
rigor; the temperature may rise to 101 degrees or to 104 degrees F.,
and there may be a gentle moisture or a profuse sweat.There does not
seem to be any relation between the extent and severity of the local
mischief and the systemic condition.The period of onset of intermittent hepatic fever, and its duration and
mode of termination, are by no means readily determined.Cyr fixes on
the paroxysms of colic as the beginning, but he obviously confounds the
chill and fever caused by the passage of a calculus with the true
intermittent hepatic fever.In a carefully-observed case, the facts
confirmed by an autopsy, E. Wagner[201] gives the clinical history of a
typical example of this malady: Gall-stones were found in the duodenum,
in the common and cystic ducts, but the most important one was a
polyangular stone obstructing the hepatic duct.There was an ulcer with
thickened margin at the entrance to the gall-bladder, and the mucous
membrane of the common duct near the intestinal orifice had a smooth,
cicatricial aspect of recent origin, indicating inflammatory
ulceration.The conditions favorable to the production of a morbid
material of a kind to induce septicaemic fever were therefore present.The onset of fever occurred ten days after the last seizure, time being
thus afforded for the local changes necessary.The duration of the
fever in this case was five months, but the existence of pulmonary
phthisis with cavities will explain this apparently protracted hepatic
intermittent fever.The duration of the disease in its usual form is
uncertain, and ranges between a week and two months, or even three
months, according to Charcot.[202]

[Footnote 201: _Deutsches Archiv fur klinische Medicin_, Band xxxiv.[Footnote 202: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, p.Suspension of work by the liver necessarily involves retention in the
blood of various excrementitious matters.The attempt of Flint[203] to
establish the doctrine of cholesteraemia has not been supported by the
evidence of contemporary or subsequent physiologists.This theory
denies to the other constituents of the bile any morbific action, and
concentrates those disturbances known as cholaemia on the effects of
cholesterin.As uraemia signifies not merely the presence of urea in
the blood, but of all of the toxic substances excreted by the kidneys,
so the word cholaemia comprehends all the constituents of bile having
power to derange the organism by their presence in the blood.[Footnote 203: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, 1862, p.349 _et seq._]

By cholaemia is meant those disturbances, chiefly nervous, which are
due to the presence of biliary excrementitious matters in the blood,
and not less to the effect on nutrition of the absence of bile from the
process of digestion in the intestine.As the atrophic changes proceed
in the liver, the quantity of urea and uric acid in the urine
diminishes, and presently leucin and tyrosin appear.Amongst the means
of differential diagnosis of hepatic intermittent fever from malarial
fever Charcot mentions the quantity of urea present--in the former
greatly lessened, in the latter much increased.There is, however, a
source of fallacy here not mentioned by Charcot: that is, the
variations in the amount of urea due to destruction of the hepatic
secreting structure.It follows that as changes {1092} occur in the
kidneys, to the condition of cholaemia is superadded the derangements
belonging to uraemia.When the occlusion has existed for some time--a variable period, partly
due to peculiarities of individual structure--there come on certain
characteristic symptoms of nervous origin: headache, hebetude of mind,
dull hearing, obscure or hazy vision, xanthopsia; somnolence and
greatly increasing stupor, leading into coma; rambling and incoherence
of mind, passing into delirium; muscular twitching, subsultus; muscular
weakness, deepening into paralysis; and finally, it may be, general
convulsions.As these derangements of the nervous system develop, a
light febrile movement supervenes, so that the whole complexus has the
typhoid type, or, as it can be more definitely expressed, the patient
thus affected lapses into the typhoid state.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Occlusion of the gall-ducts is an
essentially chronic malady in the greatest number of cases.As a rule,
the causes of obstruction operate slowly, but to this rule there are
exceptions.Permanent occlusion may take place suddenly, as when a
gall-stone is impacted immovably in the common duct, or when a
round-worm makes its way into the duct and is firmly fixed there,
incapable of further movement.When occlusion is once effected the gradual changes occurring in the
liver lead to slow decline of the nutrition; the bile-elements
circulating in the blood poison it and set up alterations in the
structure of the kidney, and ultimately, the brain becoming affected,
the end is reached by convulsions and coma.Although permanent
occlusion, if unrelieved, terminates in death, a small proportion of
cases get well, either in consequence of giving way of the obstructing
cause or from the opening of a new route to the intestine.Thus, a
calculus lodged in the fossa of Vater may suffer such injury to its
outer shell as to yield to the action of solvents, or, suppuration
occurring around it, the stone may be loosened and forced onward, or
ulceration may open a channel into the bowel.An incurable malady
causing the occlusion, the termination in death is only a question of
time.There are several
factors, however, whose value can be approximately estimated.When the
obstructing cause is merely local--as, for example, a gall-stone or the
cicatrix of a simple ulcer--the duration of the case is determined by
the mere effect of the suspension of the hepatic functions.As the
eliminating action of the liver and the part played by the bile in the
intestinal digestion are necessary to life, it follows that the
complete cessation of these functions must lead to death.The rate at
which decline takes place under these circumstances varies somewhat in
different subjects.Probably two years may be regarded as the maximum,
and three months the minimum, period at which death ensues when no
other pathogenetic factor intervenes.DIAGNOSIS.--To determine the fact of occlusion is by no means
difficult: the persistent jaundice, the absence of bile in the stools,
and the appearance of the bile-elements in the urine are sufficient.It
is far different when the cause of the occlusion is to be ascertained.The ease and safety with which the exploring-trocar can be used in
cases of supposed obstruction of the cystic duct enable the physician
to decide with confidence points which before could only be matters of
mere {1093} conjecture.The writer of these lines was the first to
puncture the gall-bladder and to explore, by means of a flexible probe
passed through the canula, the course of the duct.[204] It is possible
in this way to ascertain the existence of gall-stones in the
gall-bladder, to find an obstruction at the entrance of the cystic
duct, to demonstrate the presence of echinococci cysts, and to remove
for microscopical examination pathological fluids of various kinds.More recently, Whittaker and Ransohoff[205] of Cincinnati have
attempted the detection of a gall-stone impacted at any point by the
introduction of an exploring-needle; and this practice has been
imitated by Harley[206] of London, but without any reference to the
pioneer and prior investigation of his American colleagues.The case of
Whittaker and Ransohoff survived the exploratory puncture, but Harley's
case proved fatal from traumatic peritonitis.Notwithstanding this
untoward result, Harley persists in the advocacy of this method.It
must appear to any one familiar with the intricate arrangement of the
parts composing the anatomy of this region a most hazardous proceeding,
and hardly to be justified in view of the superior safety and certainty
of my method.To explore the interior of the gall-bladder an
aspirator-trocar is introduced; any fluid intended for microscopical
examination is then withdrawn, and through the canula a flexible
whalebone bougie is passed.[Footnote 204: _The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic_ for 1878-79; also, W.
W. Keen, M.D., "On Cholecystotomy," _The Medical News_, Sept., 1884.][Footnote 205: _Lancet and Clinic_, 1884.][Footnote 206: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1884.]When icterus comes on in a few days after birth and persists until
death ensues by convulsions and coma, there can be no doubt regarding
congenital absence or impermeability of the common duct.Permanent
retention-jaundice, accompanied by the characteristic symptoms of that
condition immediately succeeding an attack of hepatic colic, is
probably due to impaction by a calculus.When, at or after middle life,
in a patient with a history of former attacks due to gall-stones, there
begins a fixed pain in the right hypochondrium, and subsequently
retention-jaundice, the existence of a malignant growth in connection
with the cicatricial tissue and ancient organized exudation should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if subsequently a tumor
can be felt.If with a localized pain slowly-developing jaundice,
intestinal indigestion, fats and oils appearing unchanged in the
stools, and a condition of prostration more than is properly referable
to the derangement of the hepatic functions, come on in a man or woman
after thirty-five, cancer of the head of the pancreas should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if a tumor can be
detected in that situation.It should not be forgotten, however, that
in emaciated subjects the head of the pancreas may be so prominent as
to be mistaken for a scirrhous growth.A pulsating tumor of the right hypochondrium, accompanied by jaundice,
may be an aneurism of the hepatic artery.Pulsation may be communicated
to a bunch of enlarged portal lymphatic glands, which will compress the
common duct, but in this case, as the increase in the size of the
glands is due to caseous, amyloid, or cancerous deposits, there will be
found a source whence these morbid products are derived, and will
explain the nature of a tumor thus constituted.The differentiation of hypertrophic cirrhosis from occlusion of a
slowly-forming character is by no means easy.In both jaundice {1094}
gradually appears; in both the liver is enlarged, but in hypertrophic
cirrhosis much more than in occlusion; and in the latter the
gall-bladder is full--may indeed be distended--whilst in the former it
is empty or contains but little bile.The history of the case may
indicate the nature of the symptoms.Previous attacks of hepatic colic,
and the symptoms of occlusion supervening on the last, are highly
significant of calculous occlusion.TREATMENT.--To ascertain the nature of the occlusion is a necessary
preliminary to any exact treatment.In many cases this must remain a
mere conjecture, when, of course, the treatment is only symptomatic.When it is probable or certain that the duct is obstructed by a
calculus, two methods may be resorted to for its removal: one method is
to break up the calculus by mechanical means; the other is to effect
its solution by chemical agents.Fracture of an impacted calculus is not a merely fanciful expedient.If
the site of the obstruction is ascertained, an attempt may be made to
penetrate the calculus by an aspirator-needle passed through the
abdominal walls, according to the method of Whittaker and Ransohoff.The dangers attendant on this mere puncture are great, and a fatal
result has occurred in one of the very few cases in which it has been
done.Less severe and dangerous methods for attempting the
disintegration of a calculus should be first tried, as follows: Make
firm friction with the fingers along the inferior margin of the ribs
and toward the epigastrium and umbilicus, whilst the opposite side
posteriorly is supported by the hand spread out and applied firmly.A
strong faradic current sent through the region of the gall-bladder and
ducts has in several instances seemed to do good--indeed, to remove
obstructions.A calculus impacted may be dislodged either by the
fracture of its surfaces or by the strong muscular contractions of the
abdominal walls and of the muscular layer of the duct.Most calculi are
easily broken, and when the smallest breach is made in the external
crust disintegration follows; and some calculi are so friable as to
yield to slight pressure.Furthermore, the slightest solution in the
continuity of the rind disposes the whole mass to dissolve in suitable
menstrua.Mechanical rupture is so important a step in the process of
disintegration of an impacted calculus that so serious an operation as
section of the abdomen as a preliminary to it should be considered.The
cavity exposed, the obstructed duct is found, and its retained calculus
is mashed without section of the duct.I find one instance[207] in
which this was done as a subordinate part of a cholecystotomy, and the
breaking up of the stone proved to be easy of accomplishment.It is
also the method of Tait, who proposes to mash the calculus by means of
suitable forceps fitted with padded blades.[Footnote 207: Harley's case, _op.cit._]

I have suggested a means of effecting solution of an impacted calculus
which seems, on further reflection, well worthy of consideration.The
proposal is to inject, through a canula introduced into the
gall-bladder, one of the solvents of the cholesterin calculus before
mentioned.I have already used the canula as a duct for the passage of
an exploring-sound, and have by means of it explored the interior of
the gall-bladder.It is quite as feasible to inject through the canula
a solvent, successive charges of which can be thrown in and withdrawn
by the aspirator.{1095} That the usual solvents introduced by the stomach can effect the
solution of impacted calculi has been declared impossible by
Trousseau;[208] and with this conclusion I unhesitatingly agree.I have
already discussed this part of the subject, and need now only refer the
reader to that section.[Footnote 208: _Clinique medicale_, _loc.cit._]

The various causes of obstruction besides calculi do not offer an
inviting field for the exercise of therapeutical skill.Each case must
be treated according to the nature of the obstructing cause; hence to
make an accurate diagnosis is an essential preliminary to suitable
treatment.DISEASES OF THE PORTAL VEIN.Thrombosis and Embolism of the Portal Vein; Stenosis; Pylephlebitis.DEFINITION.--By the terms at the head of this section are meant the
various pathological processes which induce coagulation of the blood in
some part of the portal system.As the portal vein is made up of many
branches coming from the various organs of the abdominal cavity except
the kidneys, and as it empties, so to speak, into the liver, it is
obvious that various and complex derangements will ensue on the
formation of thrombi.CAUSES.--Thrombosis of the portal vein occurs under three general
conditions: the blood is in a readily coagulable state; the action of
the heart is weak and the blood-current sluggish; the circulation
through the vein is impeded by external pressure.The coagulability of
the blood is increased in diseases characterized by an excess of its
fibrin-producing constituents, of which cirrhosis of the liver may be
mentioned as one having this peculiarity.In chronic maladies of a
depressing kind there may be simply a weak action of the heart, or the
muscular tissue of the organ may be affected by a fatty and atrophic
degeneration.The external pressure by which the blood-current through
the vein is impeded may be caused by the newly-formed connective tissue
of Glisson's capsule, by enlarged lymphatics in the hilus of the liver,
or by tumors of various kinds.The first named of these causes of
compression--atrophic cirrhosis--is most frequently acting.Very
rarely, organized exudations of the peritoneum may be so situated as to
compress the portal vein.This result can only happen when the hepatic
portion of the peritoneum is involved.Pylephlebitis exists in two forms: the adhesive and suppurative.The
former results in changes not unlike those of simple thrombosis.The
blood coagulates in the affected part of the vessel, the clot is
organized, and the vessel ultimately forms a solid rounded cord which
is permanently occluded.The suppurative variety is so different in its
origin and in its results that it requires separate treatment, and I
therefore postpone the consideration of it to the next section.{1096} SYMPTOMS OF THROMBOSIS AND ADHESIVE PYLEPHLEBITIS.--It is a
remarkable fact that the biliary function of the liver is not
necessarily affected in cases of occlusion of the portal vein.It is
true, in advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the interlobular veins are
obliterated by the pressure of the contracting newly-formed connective
tissue, the functions of the liver are arrested in so far as the damage
thus caused extends.Notwithstanding the blocking of the portal,
sufficient blood reaches the hepatic cells by the anastomosis between
the hepatic artery and the interlobular veins--an anatomical connection
demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten.[209] So long as this anastomosis
continues bile will be formed, although the portal vein is occluded.[Footnote 209: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxvii.153, "Ueber
Circulationsstorungen in der Leber."]The most significant symptoms of thrombosis of the portal vein are the
sudden formation of ascites, which quickly assumes a very high grade,
and equally sudden passive congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, enlargement of the spleen, and distension of the superficial
veins of the abdominal parietes.When these symptoms succeed to
cirrhosis of the liver, or appear after the formation of a tumor in the
hepatic region, or come on in the course of phthisis or chronic
inflammation of the hepatic peritoneum, the existence of thrombus of
the portal vein may be reasonably suspected.Coincidently with the occlusion of the portal vein the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane becomes the seat of a catarrhal
process, and to the fluid thus produced is added a much more abundant
transudation from the distended capillaries.Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea result, the rejected matters being serous, watery, and in
many cases tinged with blood.Now and then quite a severe hemorrhage
takes place, and the blood is brought up by vomiting (haematemesis) or
is discharged by stool.Hemorrhoids form, and, in large masses
protruding, much pain is experienced, and free bleeding may result from
rupture of a distended vein.The veins of the abdominal parietes, which in the normal state are
invisible or at least not prominent, and which form anastomoses with
the portal, when the obstruction occurs dilate, sometimes to a
remarkable extent.The most important anastomosis is that between the
femoral and saphena and internal mammary and epigastric veins.When the
hepatic branches of the portal are closed, but the trunk remains
pervious, the parumbilical vein enlarges greatly, and, communicating
with the superficial veins of the anterior part of the abdominal walls,
forms a radiating network of tortuous veins to which is given the
striking title of caput Medusae.The most significant symptom of portal thrombosis is a quickly-forming
ascites.It is true, ascites is a common symptom in advanced cirrhosis,
but the rapid accumulation of fluid and the prompt filling of the
cavity after tapping distinguish that which arises from portal
thrombosis from all others.Besides its excessive extent, the ascites
presents the usual symptoms.Due to the same cause as the enlargement of the superficial veins, the
hemorrhages, the ascites, etc., there occurs considerable hypertrophy
of the spleen in many of the cases.It sometimes happens that the new
compensatory circulation and the hemorrhages from some part in the
{1097} usual route of the portal so dispose of the blood that the
spleen does not enlarge sufficiently to be readily made out.COURSE AND TERMINATION.--It is obvious that a condition such as that
induced by thrombosis of the portal must be comparatively quickly
fatal; but the cases vary in duration as the compensatory circulation
is more or less complete.Whilst the majority of cases terminate within
two weeks, instances of several months' duration are not unknown, but a
fatal termination, sooner or later, is inevitable in all cases.Coming on in the course of some chronic affection of the liver or some
obstructing cause exterior to the organ, there soon follow ascites,
nausea and vomiting, haematemesis, bloody stools of a liquid character,
enlargement of the spleen, distension of the abdominal veins, and the
distressing symptoms produced by an excessive accumulation of fluid in
the peritoneal cavity.DIAGNOSIS.--As there is no symptom of thrombosis of the portal which
may not be caused by advanced cirrhosis, the diagnosis rests on the
rapid production of the attendant phenomena and their conjoint
appearance.TREATMENT.--A symptomatic treatment is alone possible.The highly
irritable and congested intestinal mucous membrane precludes the
employment of hydragogue cathartics.Salines which cause outward
diffusion from the vessels are the only cathartics which can be used
with propriety.Action of the kidneys and of the skin must be
maintained.To this end the resin of copaiba in pilular form and
pilocarpine subcutaneously may be used.If the strength of the patient
will permit, leeches around the anus can be applied, and much relief
may be expected from free bleeding.It is probable that opening a
swollen hemorrhoid would give the same kind of relief as that caused by
a free hemorrhage.In any case the benefit derived from treatment must
be merely palliative and temporary.Suppurative Pylephlebitis.PATHOGENY.--Primary pylephlebitis rarely if ever occurs.On the other
hand, the secondary form is by no means uncommon; it succeeds to
ulcerative or purulent inflammation at some point in the circuit of
origin of the portal radicles.The most frequently-occurring cause is
ulceration and suppuration of some part of the intestinal tube, and
hence the most common result is multiple abscess of the liver.Pylephlebitis has often resulted from typhlitis; from ulcers of the
large intestine, as in dysentery; from such traumatic injuries as tying
hemorrhoids; from proctitis; from ulcers of the stomach and similar
morbid processes elsewhere within the range of origin of the portal
system.The inflammatory or ulcerative action
extends to and involves the walls of the veins, or some morbid material
diffuses through the vein walls.In either case coagulation of the
blood in the vessel ensues, and the clot undergoes a series of changes
resulting in the formation of emboli, which, carried into the main
current, are subsequently lodged in the hepatic capillaries.There are three steps in the morbid process: the changes in the vein
wall; the production and transformation of the thrombus; and the
formation of secondary suppurating foci in the liver.{1098} The appearance of the tunics of the inflamed vessels varies with
the stage at which they are examined.At first the walls of the vessels
are reddish from congestion, succulent, and swollen, infiltrated by
leucocytes and inflammatory exudation and the cellular elements
undergoing proliferation.The intima especially is much altered in its
appearance and structure, becoming thick, opaque, grayish or yellowish
in color, and having adherent to it a thrombus passing through its
characteristic changes.Ulceration of the intima then occurs, and the
purulent elements, with shreds of tissue, mingle with the degenerating
blood-clot, and ultimately there remains a purulent depot lined with
sloughing, even gangrenous, contents.Emboli detached from such
decomposing thrombus are arrested in the vessels of the liver, and
there set up a suppurating phlebitis, ending in an abscess formation,
or a quantity of pus from the original point of ulcerative phlebitis
passes into the portal vein, and is generally distributed through the
hepatic branches, here and there foci of suppuration being established
by the deposit of decomposing emboli.There may be numerous small
abscesses irregularly distributed through the liver, or there may be
one or two larger collections of pus.Very often the vessel whose
occlusion by a suppurating embolus has caused the mischief is
destroyed, and hence no communication with the abscess-cavity can then
be traced.These abscesses are not limited by a line of inflammatory
demarcation or by a limiting membrane, but the hepatic tissue adjacent
is congested and infiltrated with pus.Ulceration, abscesses, or purulent inflammation occurring at any point
within the area of origin of the radicles of the portal vein may induce
pylephlebitis and consequent hepatic abscess.There are two points at
which, suppuration established, secondary pylephlebitis is most apt to
occur: the caecum; the rectum.As respects the former, the symptoms of
typhlitis precede the hepatic disturbance; and as respects the latter,
usually dysentery, or rather proctitis, is the initial disease.In both
sources of the hepatic trouble the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
chiefly concerned--a fact explicable by reference to the sluggishness
of the circulation and the distended condition of these veins, whence
it is that thrombus is very readily induced.Numerous instances of
pylephlebitis following suppurative lesions of the caecum have been
reported.One of the most recent, and at the same time typical,
examples of such conditions is that published by Bradbury[210] of
Cambridge, England.The initial lesion was "an ulcer the size of a
split pea" situated near "the junction of the vermiform appendix and
caecum.""The hemorrhoidal veins and the inferior mesenteric above were
filled with breaking-down clot and pus," and "the liver contained many
abscesses of various sizes, the largest about the size of a lemon,
which had burst through the diaphragm."As is so often the case, the
ulcer of the caecum produced no recognizable disturbance, and important
symptoms were manifest only when the emboli lodged in the liver set up
suppuration, when there occurred the usual signs of hepatic abscess.In
the West and South hepatic abscess due to pylephlebitis, induced by
proctitis, with ulceration of the rectum, is a common incident.Various
examples of this kind have fallen under my own observation.The
relatively greater frequency of this form of pylephlebitis is due to
the fact above {1099} stated, that the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
voluminous, have a sluggish current, and are liable to over-distension
by pressure of feces and by external abdominal bands and clothing.Cases of a corresponding character arise from suppuration and
ulceration elsewhere within the portal circuit.Thus, Bristowe[211]
reports a case in which pylephlebitis resulted from an ulcer of the
stomach, the neighboring veins becoming implicated and the usual
results following.[Footnote 210: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, Sept.450,
"Proceedings of the Cambridge Medical Society."][Footnote 211: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,
vol.When inflammation has begun in a radicle of the portal vein, it may
proceed to the liver by contiguity of tissue, the whole intervening
portion of the vessel being affected.Probably more frequently the
intra-hepatic portion of the portal is inflamed by emboli, and the
adjacent hepatic tissue then undergoes suppuration, as has been already
set forth.SYMPTOMS.--There being two points of disease--the primary lesion of the
peripheral vessel and the secondary results in the hepatic portion of
the portal--the symptomatology must have a corresponding expression.The stomach, the caecum, or the rectum, or some other organ or tissue,
being occupied by a morbid process, there will be a characteristic
complex of symptoms.Taking up the most usual primary disturbance, a
typhlitis or an ulcer of the caecum, there will be pain, tenderness,
and possibly fever, occupying in point of time the period proper to
such a malady and an amount of disturbance of function determined by
the extent of the lesion.The symptoms caused by a single small ulcer
of the caecum, as in the example narrated by Bradbury, may present no
characteristic features and may have little apparent importance, and
yet the lesion is productive of very grave consequences.When from any of the causes mentioned above a thrombus forms in a vein
of the portal system in consequence of the extension of the
inflammation about it, the case, what importance soever it previously
had, now takes on new characters.The onset of the inflammation of the
vein walls and the puriform degeneration of the thrombus is announced
by a chill--a severe rigor, or chilly sensations at least.At the time
of the chill, and sometimes before it, pain is felt, significant of the
lesion in the vein.When proctitis or typhlitis precedes the
pylephlebitis, pain appropriate to the malady is a significant symptom;
but the pain which comes on with the beginning of the inflammation in
the liver is a new sign.The most frequent sites of the pain are the
right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, but it may also be felt in the
left hypochondrium or in either iliac fossa.Unless there be diffuse
peritonitis the pain is accompanied by a strictly-localized tenderness
to pressure.The situation of the pain may afford an indication of the
vein attacked, and when there are two points at which pain is
experienced, one may originate at the first situation of the morbid
action; the other will be due to pylephlebitis.The fever succeeding the chill is decided, and in some cases may attain
to extraordinary height--a manifestation indicative of the pyaemic
character of the affection.The fever intermits or remits, with a more
or less profuse perspiration.The febrile phenomena are similar in
their objective expression to malarial fever, but there is an important
difference in respect to the periods of recurrence of the chills.The
paroxysms are very irregular as to time: there may a daily seizure at
different hours, or there may be several chills on the same day.In
other words, the {1100} paroxysms have the pyaemic characteristics
rather than the malarial.After a time the intermittent phenomenon
ceases, and there occurs a remission merely, the exacerbation being
preceded by chilliness and succeeded by sweating.The sweats are
characteristically profuse and exhausting.During the sweating the
temperature begins to decline, and reaches its lowest point just before
the chilly sensations during the early morning announce the onset of
the daily exacerbation of the afternoon and evening.The thermal line
exhibits many irregularities until the febrile movement assumes the
remittent type, when there occur the morning remission and nocturnal
exacerbation.The maxima may be from 103 degrees F. to 105 degrees,
even to 106 degrees.When the pain and chill come on, disturbances of the digestive organs
ensue.When a large vein of the portal system is occluded, the
remaining veins must be over-distended, and congestion of a part or of
all of the digestive tract will be a result.An acute gastric catarrh
is set up.The appetite is lost, the stomach becomes irritable, and
vomiting is a usual incident.Sometimes the disgust for food is
extreme, and the nausea and vomiting are almost incessant.The vomited
matters consist of a watery mucus mixed with thin bile after a time,
and now and then of a bloody mucus.Thrombosis of a stomach vein may
occur, to be followed by an acute ulcer, and from this considerable
hemorrhage may proceed, when the vomit will consist of blood.Such an
accident, happening to the mucous membrane of the intestine, will be
indicated by bloody stools if the ulceration is low down, or by
brownish, blackish, or chocolate- stools if higher up in the
small bowel.The tongue has usually a characteristic coating in these cases.Large
patches of a rather heavy and darkish fur form, and, cast off from time
to time, leave a glazed and somewhat raw surface.Sometimes there is a
profuse salivary flow, but more frequently the mouth is dry.The lips
are fissured or contain patches of herpes, and the buccal cavity may be
more or less completely lined by patches of aphthae.Diarrhoea is a usual symptom, the stools being dark when mixed with
blood, or grayish and pasty or clay- when there is jaundice.Three-fourths of the cases of pylephlebitis are free from jaundice.This symptom may occur at the onset when the common duct is obstructed
by a calculus, but in other cases it appears when the formation of pus
in the liver exerts sufficient compression of the hepatic ducts to
prevent the passage of the bile.When jaundice occurs, it is accompanied by the usual symptoms.The
urine, previously unchanged, is now  by bile-pigment, and the
alterations in the renal structure and function belonging to jaundice
also take place.It sometimes happens that the obstruction of the portal vein is
sufficient to cause enlargement of the superficial veins of the
abdomen, but the duration of the disease is usually too brief to permit
much deviation from the normal, except rarely.In the cases
characterized by the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis the abdomen will
present a swollen and tense appearance, and there will be acute
tenderness to pressure.The area of hepatic and splenic dulness is not
increased from the outset, but is evident, as respects the spleen, soon
after the obstruction at the liver, and as respects the liver when the
formation of abscesses occurs.{1101} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of pylephlebitis
is compounded of the disturbance at the original point of disease, and
of the secondary inflammation at the several points in the liver where
emboli set up purulent inflammation.There are, therefore, two distinct
symptom-groups, and a short intervening period in which the first is
being merged into the second.The duration is variable, but the extreme
limits are not remote from each other, the condition of pylephlebitis
terminating in from two weeks to three months, the shorter being the
more usual.The termination is death, doubtless invariably; for, as in
true pyaemia arising from other causes, the septic changes in the blood
are such as to preclude the possibility of a return to the normal
condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The main point in the diagnosis consists in the occurrence
of an evident local inflammation, followed by the signs of suppuration
in the hepatic region coming on subsequent to ulceration and
suppuration at some point in the peripheral expansion of the portal
system.Thus, when a proctitis with ulceration of the rectum has been
in existence for some time, there occur pain and tenderness in the
hepatic region, accompanied by an irregularly intermittent fever and by
profuse sweating, it can be assumed with considerable certainty that
emboli have been deposited in some one or more of the terminal branches
of the portal.The evidences of hepatic trouble--swelling of the organ,
jaundice, etc.--and of portal obstruction, which then supervene,
indicate with some precision the nature of the case.TREATMENT.--Although pylephlebitis wears a most unfavorable aspect, the
possibility of a favorable result should always be entertained by the
therapeutist.As absorption of medicaments must be slow--indeed, uncertain--by the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane when there is portal occlusion, it is
well to attempt treatment by the skin and subcutaneous connective
tissue.Gastro-intestinal disturbance--nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea--should be treated by a combination of bismuth, creasote, and
glycerin--remedies acting locally chiefly.Ammonia--the carbonate and
solution of the acetate--is indicated, and should be given for the
purpose of dissolving thrombi and emboli.Corrosive sublimate, carbolic
acid, and quinine can be administered by the subcutaneous areolar
tissue.Quinine may also be introduced by friction with lard, and in
considerable quantity.V. PARASITES OF THE LIVER.Echinococcus of the Liver; Hydatids of the Liver.DEFINITION.--The echinococcus is the intermediate or larval stage in
the development of the Taenia echinococcus--the completed
parasite--whose chief habitat is the intestine of the dog.As the
natural and clinical history of parasites is elsewhere treated of, the
subject is here confined to the development of echinococci cysts in the
liver, its ducts, and vessels.CAUSES.--The presence of echinococcus vesicles in the liver is due to
{1102} the migration of the embryo from the intestinal canal.As
Davaine[212] has ascertained by analysis of all the recorded examples
previous to the publication of his treatise, echinococci are found in
as large a proportion in the liver as in all the other organs combined.This statement is repeated with approval by Cobbold[213] and by
Heller.[214] The embryo, set free in the intestine from the food or
drink containing the ova, starts on its migration.There are several
reasons why the liver is selected for its habitat: it is the largest
accessible organ; the common duct and the portal vein offer the most
convenient roadway for reaching and penetrating its substance.The
exact route or routes of which the parasite avails itself in migrating
have not been definitely settled, although Friedreich has shown that
the portal vein is the medium of transmission of the Echinococcus
multilocularis.The comparative frequency with which the liver is
entered indicates that the portal vein is the favorite route of
migration.[Footnote 212: _Traite des Entozoaires et des Maladies vermineuses,
etc._, par C. Davaine, Paris, 1877, p.[Footnote 213: _Entozoa_, by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., London,
1874, p.iii of _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.PATHOLOGY AND SYMPTOMS.--The number of echinococci reaching the liver
varies from one to ten or twelve or more.They increase in size from
the time of their deposit in the organ, and ultimately attain to large
proportions.The rapidity of growth depends somewhat on the character
of the tissue in which imbedded, and the amount of disturbance of
function is determined by the position of the parasite in the organ.Echinococci may be deposited in any part of the liver--in the substance
of the organ, in the ducts, or in the vessels--but the most usual site
is near the capsule, and, developing outwardly in the direction of
least resistance, impart to the outline of the organ an irregular
contour.As the echinococci develop, the adjacent parts of the liver
pressed upon undergo atrophy, but the connective tissue of the organ
contributes to the formation of the dense capsule which envelops them.But as the increase in size is not rapid, although continuous, if the
cysts are situated at the periphery and adjacent to the capsule, they
may be present for many months without causing any distinct symptoms.In a case occurring under my own observation last year the only symptom
which attracted attention was an enlargement of the hepatic region, and
on examination a characteristic elastic, irregular, and painless tumor
could be readily detected by sight and touch occupying the right
hypochondrium and extending into the epigastric and umbilical regions.When the echinococci cysts impinge on the portal vein or on the hepatic
duct, there will be caused the usual results of such pressure--ascites
or jaundice, or both conditions may occur simultaneously, with
obstruction of both vein and duct.When the cysts develop downwardly,
the stomach and intestines will be displaced, and nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea or constipation, and, it may be, considerable pain of a
colic-like character, will be caused.An upward development of the
cysts gives rise to more pronounced disturbances.The diaphragm is
pushed upward, the heart displaced, and the lungs, especially the
right, compressed.Occasionally the diaphragm is softened and
perforated by the pressure of the enlarging cysts, and the lungs are
ultimately tunnelled, the parasites being discharged by the bronchi.{1103} The growth of an echinococcus tumor may spontaneously cease, and
then retrograde changes take place, leading to its final disappearance.This arrest of development may occur without any obvious cause, but now
and then such a change from the ordinary course of tumors may be
effected by an external injury, as a blow on the abdomen, but more
frequently the death of the parasite is caused by ulceration into a
bile-duct, and the entrance of bile, which is a poison to these
hydatids.It sometimes happens that, opening into a duct of large size,
the daughter and granddaughter vesicles are slowly discharged through
it into the intestine, and thus a cure is effected.Inflammatory action
occurring in the cysts, adhesions may form and rupture into a
neighboring cavity take place.Direct communication may be established
with the intestine, or the cavity of the pleura or peritoneum be
entered, with results entirely disastrous.A necessarily fatal termination must also ensue when the hydatids
penetrate the ascending vena cava, but this accident is, fortunately,
very rare.The passage outward through the abdominal wall is an exceedingly
uncommon but fortunate issue of echinococcus of the liver, for in this
mode the hydatids may be discharged without much difficulty.The echinococcus vesicle is enveloped in a dense, resisting, and
elastic capsule, constructed out of the connective tissue of the part
in which it is deposited.The innermost layer of the vesicle is the
germinative (endocyst), and from its granular surface are developed the
brood-capsules and their scolices--_i.e._ the head with its suckers and
crown of hooklets.[215] Each vesicle may contain not only daughter, but
also granddaughter, progeny, numbering from a dozen up to many
thousands, and they will vary in size from the head of a pin to a
pullet's egg.It follows that the mother vesicles must also greatly
vary in size: they range from a large pin's head to a child's head.The
vesicles or sacs contain a clear, faintly yellowish, or opalescent
fluid, neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction, and holding in
solution a large per cent.of sodium chloride, but free from albumen.The specific gravity of the fluid ranges from 1007 to 1015, according
to the quantity of sodium chloride present.Succinic acid and also
haematoidin are usual constituents, besides the ingredients already
mentioned.[Footnote 215: _Entozoa_, Cobbold, p.273 _et seq._, chapter viii.]Although the form of hydatid or echinococcus cyst above described is
the usual one, there is occasionally produced an anomalous development
of the parasite, which from its resemblance to colloid cancer was
supposed to have this character until Virchow[216] unravelled the
mystery by demonstrating its true structure.This form of the parasite
is designated Echinococcus multilocularis.Its resemblance to colloid
cancer is the more striking because of the tendency of the interior of
the mass to undergo degeneration, to disintegrate, and to break up into
pus-sacs with greenish, cheesy, and bilious contents.An Echinococcus
multilocularis tumor is of almost stony hardness; it has a very dense
fibrous structure, intersected by cavities with thick gelatinous
contents.These minor cavities[217] are sacs of echinococci, but they
depart widely from the typical form, well-defined scolices being seldom
encountered.[Footnote 216: _Archiv fur Anat._, Virchow, vol.[Footnote 217: Carriere, quoted by Davaine, _op.{1104} Echinococci of the liver develop very slowly, and it is
characteristic of them to attain to very large proportions in most
cases without causing any very pronounced symptoms.There are certain
signs common to hydatids in any situation; there are others which are
due to particular circumstances.A hydatid tumor of the liver is smooth but somewhat irregular in
outline, and elastic, when it develops downward, extending below the
margin of the ribs.If, however, it grows upward, the area of hepatic
dulness extends in that direction beyond the usual limits; the
diaphragm is pushed up, the lungs forced upward to the left and
compressed, and the heart also displaced upward toward the left.The
extension of the tumor downward, in the direction of least resistance,
is more usual.If the walls of the abdomen are sufficiently thin, the
tumor large enough, and if made up of many daughter vesicles, there may
be evoked by palpation the very characteristic sign known as hydatid
purring.To produce this effect an oscillation must be caused by a
sudden impulse communicated to the tumor on one side, the hand resting
against the other side.This sensation is likened to the impression on
the eye of the vibration of a bowl of jelly.Even when there is a
well-defined tumor this symptom is comparatively infrequent, but if
present it is pathognomonic, since no other kind of tumor possesses the
property of oscillation and elastic collision of its several
constituents.When the tumor is so situated as to occlude the hepatic or common duct,
jaundice will be a symptom, and when the stomach is pressed upon there
will be epigastric oppression and nausea.If the vena cava is impinged
on or the portal vein, the usual results--ascites and oedema of the
lower extremities and of the scrotum--will be manifest.There is, of
course, nothing distinctive in these results.The Echinococcus multilocularis, situated in the substance of the
liver, causes the usual disturbances of a new formation in such a
position.Much of the hepatic tissue is destroyed by its growth, and
many of the minor ducts closed.Jaundice is an early symptom--the
first, indeed, in many cases--and is also one of the most persistent.It is present, according to Griesinger, in 10 out of 13 cases.The
usual gastro-intestinal disorders belonging to jaundice occur under
these circumstances; also the nervous disturbances of cholaemia.[218]

[Footnote 218: Davaine, _op.Enlargement of the spleen is a very frequent symptom, being present,
according to Davaine, in 11 out of 13 cases, and, according to Heller,
in 25 out of 29 cases, in which this fact was made the subject of
direct inquiry.Pressure on the vena cava causes oedema of the inferior extremities in
a small number of cases; and on the vena porta, ascites.There may
occur thrombosis of the portal, in which event the ascites will form
very quickly, and return as quickly after tapping.The usually placid course pursued by echinococcus of the liver may be
much modified by inflammation and suppuration.Having occurred, the clinical history
corresponds to other cases of hepatic abscess, and the reader is
therefore referred to the section on that topic for fuller information.DIAGNOSIS.--At the outset of echinococcus of the liver the {1105}
differentiation of the tumor from other tumors, and of the disturbances
produced by it as contrasted with the effects of other morbid growths,
becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.The size,
painlessness, elasticity, the purring tremor of the echinococcus tumor,
afford a sure basis for constructing a diagnosis, and as ultimately
developed they become the means of accurate differentiation from other
morbid growths of that locality.All doubt as to the nature of a given
hydatid tumor of the liver may be set at rest by the use of the
aspirator.The discovery of the characteristic hooklets of the scolex
in the fluid withdrawn from the tumor will be conclusive as to the
presence of echinococci.The hooklets may be absent, as in the case of
acephalocysts, but the fluid is characteristic in other respects: it
contains a large quantity of chloride of sodium and is free from
albumen.Very great difficulty is experienced in diagnosticating an echinococcus
tumor developing from the upper surface of the liver, pushing the
diaphragm and lungs upward and displacing the heart to the left.Whilst
the physical signs may be, and are, usually alike when the condition
calling for diagnosis has existed for some time, there are means of
differentiating in the history of the cases and in the initial
symptoms.The origin and growth of the echinococcus tumor are obscure and free
from constitutional disturbance; the onset of a pleuritic exudation is
marked by pain, fever, and hurried respiration and by physical signs of
a characteristic kind.It is true there are cases of so-called latent
pleurisy in which a hydrothorax forms without any well-marked
indications, but it will usually be found that some local pain, hurried
breathing, or other symptoms existed from the beginning.Those cases of
hydrothorax accompanying renal and cardiac diseases are readily enough
associated with their original cause.Echinococcus of the liver may be confounded with abscess of the liver,
but a differentiation can be readily made by attention to a few
considerations, except in the rare condition of the Echinococcus
multilocularis which has proceeded to suppuration.In this latter
condition there are no means of differentiation, since an
abscess-formation has already occurred, nor is there any need to
attempt a distinction without the occasion of a difference.Echinococcus differs from abscess in history, in the character of the
swelling, and in progress.Abscess of the liver is preceded by
paroxysms of hepatic colic, by inflammatory ulceration of some part of
the intestinal tract, or by local injury--traumatism.The onset of a
hydatid tumor is silent and painless.The swelling of the liver when an
abscess forms is not considerable at any time, and appears to be a
uniform enlargement of the organ, except when the pus tends to make its
way through the walls of the abdomen externally.An enlarging
echinococcus tumor is an obvious projection from the surface of the
liver at some point, and it does not have the characteristic
tenderness, the fluctuation of an abscess matured and ready to
discharge, and the constitutional disturbance; but it does have a
peculiar elasticity, and now and then may present that eminently
characteristic sign, the purring tremor.The use of the
exploring-trocar will usually suffice to clear up all doubts by the
withdrawal of the characteristic fluid of the hydatid cyst or of pus.DURATION AND TERMINATION.--The progress of an echinococcus {1106} tumor
is exceedingly slow, and the development of symptoms produced by its
extension is early or late according to its position and to the nature
of the parts impinged on.A spontaneous cure may take place under the
rather rare circumstances of an opening into the hepatic duct or one of
its principal divisions, and the gradual discharge of the cysts by this
outlet into the intestine.Next to this mode of termination, the most
fortunate direction taken by the enlarging cysts is through the walls
of the abdomen externally.When the growth is upward through the lungs,
the symptoms belonging to empyema or hydrothorax, with pulmonary
abscess, ensue, and the termination is fatal after a protracted course.Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is a fatal event.Ulceration into
the intestine, and the discharge of the cysts through the route thus
made, may effect a cure, but more frequently the fistulous
communication becomes a means of forming a fecal abscess.The result in any case of hydatids of the liver is much influenced by
the mode of treatment adopted and the period at which it is undertaken.As these parasites can be readily reached and destroyed by safe means,
obviously the more early the diagnosis is made and the treatment
carried out, the less the injury done to the hepatic structures and
neighboring parts.TREATMENT.--Prophylactic.--As the intestine of the dog is the natural
habitat of the Taenia echinococcus, and as the hydatid is the first
stage in the development of the ovum and the second in the life-history
of the parasite, the means of prophylaxis consist in preventing
contamination of human food and water with the dog's excrement, which
contains the ova of the parasite.In Iceland, where hydatid disease is
very prevalent, dogs and human beings living in the same huts and
obtaining their water-supply by melting the snow just about them,
contamination of food and drink must readily occur.In this country
such conditions cannot exist; nevertheless, cases of hydatids are not
infrequent.The chief, if not the only, source of contamination is
through the consumption of such uncooked vegetables as lettuce, celery,
cabbage, etc., in the folds of which the ova may be retained, and from
which an ordinary washing does not suffice to detach them.It follows
that such articles of food should be minutely inspected and cleansed
before being placed on the table.Boiling and filtration are the means of removing impurities of this
kind from potable waters.Therapeutical.--The remedial management of cases of Taenia echinococcus
is necessarily restricted to that stage in their development when by
increasing size the functions of organs begin to be affected.Internal
medicines given with the view to arrest the growth of the parasite are
useless.Formerly, such attempts were made and successes were claimed,
but it is now known that no medicine can act on organisms enclosed as
these are in a dense capsule.It is needless to occupy space with
therapeutical details of this kind, but mention may be made of the
agents that were supposed to be effective.Laennec held that baths of a
solution of common salt had a distinct curative effect.The internal
use of iodide of potassium and the local application of iodine paint
were believed to cure a case in St.George's Hospital, London, in the
practice of Mr.Kameela was, in Iceland, supposed to
have a curative effect, but notwithstanding this the physicians of that
island resort to very heroical surgical methods in the treatment of
this affection.{1107} The one means of relief consists in the removal of the vesicles,
either by suitable incisions or by compassing the death of the
parasite, after which the power of nature may be adequate to the cure.In Iceland large incisions are made into the tumor at its most
prominent part, and, although accidents are not uncommon, the results
in many cases are eminently satisfactory.The accidents are shock,
hemorrhage, and especially peritonitis.Under favorable circumstances
now no procedure is more satisfactory in its results than free incision
and drainage.The tumor should be prominent, adherent all round to the
peritoneum, and the walls of the abdomen thin to ensure complete
success without accident.At the present time, so great have been the
advances in abdominal surgery, this operative procedure may be
preferable in some few cases presenting the favoring conditions above
mentioned.Very simple expedients, however, suffice in most cases.This is now much practised in Iceland, and, as the
statistics show, with considerable success.Thus, Hjaltelin[219]
reports 100 cases cured in this way, and in his own hands this
expedient proved successful in 41 out of 50 cases operated on.In
Australia, where hydatid disease is also quite common, simple puncture
has effected a large proportion of cures,[220] and is the method of
treatment usually pursued.In England puncture has the approval of some
of the best authorities.[221]

[Footnote 219: Davaine, _op.[Footnote 220: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, August, 1873, p.[Footnote 221: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_ for 1872:
discussion participated in by Gull, Bryant, Greenhow, etc.]The mode of performing this operation consists in the introduction of
an exploring-trocar into the most prominent part of the tumor.It may
be withdrawn at once or be permitted to remain for a few minutes to
several hours.The dangers are suppuration in the sac and peritonitis;
but the former, although sometimes accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms, is not likely to endanger life, and even formidable
disturbances due to the latter are usually recovered from.The facts
show that puncture very rarely indeed causes dangerous, especially
fatal, symptoms.An eruption of urticaria has been observed to follow
puncture with the trocar, and also aspiration, in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but it has no special significance.Since the introduction of the aspirateur, puncture and withdrawal of
the fluid by means of this instrument has been practised more
frequently, and this appears to be a more effective procedure, than
simple puncture with an exploring-trocar, although in most cases the
escape of the contained fluids suffices to destroy the parasite.The
aspirateur is less likely to permit the escape of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity or the entrance of air into a vein punctured by
accident.If puncture with the trocar or aspiration be practised, shall
all the fluid be withdrawn at once?The answer to this question may be
decided by the character of the sac.Does it contain daughter and
granddaughter vesicles?If so, one puncture may not permit the escape
of much fluid; but in any event it is the practice of the most
judicious and experienced authorities[222] to withdraw as much as
possible of the contents of the cysts at the first operation.Formerly,
a method practised by some French surgeons consisted in successive
tappings, a small quantity of fluid being drawn off each time.[223]
{1108} There is no good reason for this method of treatment now, and it
seems to have been discontinued.[Footnote 222: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 223: Davaine, _supra_.]Yet another method of treatment, but less effective than puncture or
aspiration, consists in injecting into the sac, after the removal of
its contained fluid, certain agents toxic to hydatids.A solution of
the extract of fern, alcohol, solution or tincture of iodine, and bile,
are the chief remedies thus employed.It has long been known that bile
is destructive of these parasites, and cases have occurred of
spontaneous cure in which the opening of the growing cysts into a
bile-duct has secured the entrance of bile and consequent arrest of
growth and atrophy of the hydatids.Several successful cases have been
reported in which the injection of aspidium (male fern) was the
effective agent, but the threatening symptoms produced by it, and the
comparative freedom of other methods of treatment from such
disturbances, do not recommend the injections of fern.In the case
reported by Pavy[224] the extract of fern was mixed with a solution of
potassa.[Footnote 224: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1865.]Injections of iodine in solution or in the form of tincture have been
more frequently practised than of any other material.Davaine,[225] who
finds it less successful than simple puncture and aspiration,
recommends, as affording the best results, a dilute aqueous solution of
iodine.Alcohol, a solution of permanganate of potassium, and various
antiseptic agents have been used to some extent, but none of them
possess any advantages over more simple measures.The latest proposal for the treatment of hydatid cysts, and probably
the most effective consistent with entire safety, is electrolysis.Originally suggested by Althaus[226] to those who first employed the
measure on any considerable scale, it had been mentioned thirty years
before by Budd, and appears to have been first practised in Iceland on
a single case.The first elaborate attempt to establish electrolysis on
a sound basis as a regular procedure was made by C. Hilton Fagge and
Mr.[227] They operated on eight cases, and all were
successful.The method consists in the introduction of two needles
connected with the negative pole, and the application of the
positive--a moistened sponge--on the exterior in the neighborhood of
the hepatic region.The strength of current employed by Fagge and
Durham was that furnished by a battery of ten cells, and which by
previous trial was found to decompose a saline solution.The two
electrolytic needles, connected with wires attached to the negative
pole, were introduced into the most prominent part of the tumor about
two inches apart.The current was allowed to pass about ten minutes
usually, sometimes a little longer, the sponge on the exterior--the
positive pole--being shifted occasionally.The tumor may be rendered somewhat more tense and
appear to be enlarged, but more frequently it becomes softer and is
lessened in size, the increase of size being due to the disengagement
of hydrogen gas, and the diminution caused by the escape of more or
less fluid.In one case
no symptom followed, and in this the result was regarded as doubtful,
although a cure was considered probable.In the others more or less
{1109} constitutional disturbance followed, the symptoms being pain and
fever, the temperature ranging between 100 degrees and 103 degrees F.
The duration of the fever was from two to nineteen days, the latter in
one case only.As has been observed in some of the cases treated by
puncture or by aspiration, a rash appeared on the skin--in some
instances scarlatinous, in others of urticaria.It is a curious
circumstance that an eruption of urticaria is reported to have appeared
in one subject in whom a rupture of the sac into the peritoneal cavity
is supposed to have occurred.[Footnote 226: _On the Electrolytic Treatment of Tumors, etc._, London,
1867.][Footnote 227: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, 1871, p.1 _et seq._]

Although so little change in the tumor occurs immediately after the
operation, yet it undergoes slow absorption, and ultimately disappears.The time occupied in the disappearance of the tumor varies from a few
weeks to many months, the difference being due probably to the
situation of the growth, those occupying the substance of the liver
requiring a longer time to fill up.Fagge and Durham report a case in which simple acupuncture was followed
by a result apparently as good as obtained by electrolysis, and other
similar experiences have been published.If the simple introduction of
a needle suffices to arrest the growth of a hydatid cyst and induce its
atrophy, of course the more complex procedures will be abandoned.The tendency of the treatment of hydatid cysts has constantly been
toward simplicity, and the success occurs in a direct ratio thereto.In
forming an estimate of the relative value of the methods of treatment,
the average of mortality of each plan becomes the most important
factor.Simple tapping and paracentesis, the most frequently adopted
mode of treatment, is not without immediate and remote danger.Of 46
cases carefully tabulated by Murchison,[228] there were 3 deaths
properly attributable to the operation; but the after
results--suppuration of the cyst and its consequences, peritonitis,
etc.--cannot be measured so accurately.About two-thirds of the cases
thus treated result in cure, and in a majority of these a single
operation suffices.The injection of the various substances which have
been employed for that purpose does not seem to increase the proportion
of cures, and their use distinctly enhances the dangers of the
treatment.At present, the decision as to the method of treatment to be
employed in any case should be made between simple tapping,
electrolysis, and acupuncture.Of these, the last mentioned, it can
hardly be doubted, is the method which is most desirable, for although
it has not been employed so largely as the others, thus far the results
have been better: the percentage of recoveries without accident has
been higher relatively than by other methods of treatment.As
acupuncture presents no special difficulties or dangers, and is but
little painful, it may be tried first, reserving more formidable
measures for the failures by this simple expedient.[Footnote 228: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]


Distoma hepaticum and Distoma lanceolatum (Liver-Flukes).The Distoma hepaticum, entitled by Linnaeus Fasciola hepatica, occurs
very frequently in herbivorous animals and occasionally in the biliary
{1110} passages of man.[229] It is, however, less important than the
Distoma lanceolatum, which, although much smaller than the former,
occurs in much larger numbers.[Footnote 229: Davaine, _Traite des Entozoaires_, Paris, 1877, p.240
_et seq._; also, Cobbold, _Entozoa_, p.Distoma hepaticum is a leech-like parasite from 25 to 30 mm.in length,
of a brownish color, smooth to the naked eye, but thickly covered with
minute spikes or spines to be seen with a low power, and provided with
a cephalic (entrance to oral cavity) and an abdominal sucking disk,
which are also organs of locomotion.The Distoma lanceolatum owes its
name to its lancet shape; it is smaller than D. hepaticum, measuring
about 8 mm.in length and half this or less in width; it is unprovided
with spines, but contains two suckers at the side.Both parasites are
hermaphrodite; the ova, according to Cobbold (p.166), have "an average
longitudinal diameter of 1/180, whilst their greatest transversal
measurement is about 1/270."These ova are capable of some movement,
provided as they are with a ciliated envelope.The disease known as the rot in sheep, and a peculiar cachexia entitled
by Davaine la cachexie aqueuse, are caused by the presence of distoma.The ova gain access to man through the use of unwashed cress, lettuce,
and similar vegetables eaten in the raw state, and in drinking-water.The number of reported examples
collected from all sources by the indefatigable Davaine is twelve.[230]

[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p.253 _et seq._]

The larger distoma passes into the common and hepatic duct and
gall-bladder, whilst the smaller (lanceolatum) enters the finer
ramifications, and, there multiplying, several consequences may ensue.The irritation caused by their presence and development will excite a
more or less severe cholangitis, or, accumulating in sufficient
numbers, an actual obstruction will be induced, and jaundice and
structural alterations of the liver will in turn be brought on.The DIAGNOSIS of such a malady is, in the very nature of the case,
uncertain at best, and in most cases impossible.Nevertheless, it may
be made in rare instances.The existence of the rot may cast suspicion
on the mutton and kitchen vegetables so situated as to suggest the
possibility of contamination with the ova of distoma.Definite and
conclusive information will be afforded by the presence of the ova,
still more of the more or less fully-developed parasite, in the feces
of a patient effected by the symptoms of catarrhal jaundice or
occlusion of the biliary passages.By tapping the gall-bladder
parasites may be withdrawn.The SYMPTOMS are those common to cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts
(cholangitis), catarrhal jaundice, or occlusion of the passages, as may
be.As these have been detailed under their respective heads, it is not
necessary to repeat the observations already made.As regards the TREATMENT, in addition to the methods of management
recommended in such cases it may be stated that the use of certain
parasiticides offers a reasonable prospect of good results.Creasote,
bichloride of mercury, thymol, eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen
(gaultheria), and similar agents are rational remedies and should be
fairly tried.{1111} Parasites in the Portal Vein.The entozoon which by its presence in the blood causes the disease
chyluria also inhabits the portal vein.In some parts of the
world--Brazil more especially--this disease is exceedingly common.It
has occurred also in two or three instances in England, and the writer
has had a case within the past year (1884) in Philadelphia.The
parasites in this case were found in immense numbers in the urine.The blood of the portal vein sometimes is actually filled, and the
liver substance itself is penetrated, by them, but nothing is known of
the alterations they induce in these organs.When cases of haematuria
or chylous urine due to the Filaria sanguinis hominis occur, the
changes are not confined to the urinary organs, but often, doubtless,
involve the liver.There are no signs in the present state of our
knowledge by which the existence of these parasites in the portal vein
and liver can be determined.{1112}

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS.BY LOUIS STARR, M.D.Until the middle of the seventeenth century the prevalent views upon
the functions and diseases of the pancreas were vague in the extreme.By some the organ was regarded simply as a cushion provided for the
protection of the neighboring blood-vessels and nerves; by others it
was looked upon as the seat of lesion in many very diverse diseases, as
ague, hypochondriasis, melancholia, and so on.In 1642, Wirsung's discovery of an excretory duct demonstrated the fact
that the pancreas was a special organ, and initiated the successful
investigation of the physiology and pathology of the gland.For many
years after this, however, little progress was made, and it is only
comparatively recent investigations that have furnished definite and
reliable information upon the subject.Even now our knowledge of the
clinical and pathological features of diseases of the pancreas is far
behind that of many of the other viscera of the body, the chief reasons
for this being the uncertainty in regard to the physiology of the gland
and the rarity with which its lesions are primary and uncomplicated.ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The pancreas is a long, somewhat flattened,
narrow, acinous gland, pinkish-white in color, and of looser texture
than the salivary glands, which it otherwise closely resembles in
structure.It is hammer-shaped, measures from six to eight inches in
length, one and a half inches in breadth, and about three-fourths of an
inch in thickness, and varies in weight from three to five ounces.The
gland is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity; the
expanded portion, or head, lies in the concavity of the duodenum;
thence it extends transversely across the epigastric and both
hypochondriac regions on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and in
contact with the posterior abdominal wall.As it passes toward the left
it gradually decreases in size, and the narrowest part, or tail, rests
against the spleen.Behind the organ are the crura of the diaphragm,
the aorta, the inferior cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the
solar plexus; in front of it, the stomach and the left lobe of the
liver.Its anterior surface alone is invested with peritoneum, being
covered by the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.The ascending
portion of the head is intimately connected with the duodenum by dense
connective tissue, and at times the descending portion, by extending
backward and outward, forms an almost complete ring around the gut; the
body is loosely attached by connective tissue to the posterior
abdominal wall, and the {1113} left extremity and tail are joined to
the left kidney and suprarenal capsule and to the spleen by loose
areolar tissue.The gland is supplied with arterial blood by branches
springing from the pancreatico-duodenal and splenic vessels; its veins
join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins; its lymphatics
communicate with the lumbar glands; and its nerves are branches from
the solar plexus.The principal excretory duct, the canal of Wirsung,
has at its widest part the calibre of a goose-quill.It begins by the
union of five small branches at the tail, and extends transversely
through the substance of the gland from left to right, nearer the lower
than the upper border, and the anterior than the posterior surface; it
is joined throughout its course by numerous small branches from the
acini, which enter it at acute angles.In the head the duct curves
slightly downward, and as a rule opens with the ductus choledochus into
the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum; sometimes,
however, it has a separate opening into the intestine.A second,
smaller, duct runs from the ascending portion of the head, and usually
joins the main duct, but may also open independently.The acini of the gland are from.045 mm.in diameter, and
are composed of a very thin membrane lined with pavement cells.The
thin walls of the excretory ducts are formed of connective tissue and
elastic fibres, and are lined by a single layer of small cylindrical
epithelial cells.The terminal extremities of the ducts form a complete
network around the glandular cells, resembling the intralobular biliary
canaliculi.The acini are imbedded in a mass of adipose tissue which
contains the vessels and nerves.The topographical relation of the head of the pancreas to the ductus
choledochus is of clinical importance.As a rule (fifteen times in
twenty-two, Wyss), the bile-duct descends near the head, toward the
duodenum; frequently it runs through this part of the organ, being
either partially or entirely surrounded by the gland substance.Now,
when the bile-duct merely passes over the pancreas, any enlargement,
unless excessive, would simply push it aside, but when it passes
through the head, a comparatively slight amount of disease is
sufficient to close it entirely and cause jaundice.It is only since the observations of Bernard in 1848 that the
prominence of the pancreatic juice as a digestive fluid has been
recognized.It fulfils several important purposes: in the first place,
it emulsifies the fatty articles of food; secondly, it converts starch
and cane-sugar into glucose; and, finally, it supplements the action of
the gastric juice upon nitrogenous materials and completes their
digestion.Each of these changes is probably brought about through the
agency of a special ferment (Danilewsky).The pancreatic juice is not
secreted continuously.According to the observations of Bernstein,
there are two separate secretory flows following each ingestion of
food--one occurring shortly after the food enters the stomach; the
other a few hours later, corresponding in time to the passage of the
food from the stomach into the intestine, the latter being followed by
a period of rest until the next meal.Both the condition of nausea and
the act of vomiting arrest the secretion.When the vagus is divided and
the central extremity of the cut nerve is irritated, the secretion is
also arrested, and remains checked {1114} for a long time.The arrest
in each instance is attributed to reflex action of the spinal cord and
sympathetic nerve.At the same time, irritation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach caused by the presence of food increases the flow of
pancreatic juice, and so too does simple section of the nerves which
accompany the arteries.It would seem, therefore, that the gland is
under the influence of two sets of nerves from the vagus--one
inhibiting, the other exciting, its secretion.GENERAL ETIOLOGY.--Pancreatic disease occurs more frequently in men
than in women.No period of life is exempt from it, but it is most
commonly met with in the aged.The predisposing causes are
constitutional syphilis, pregnancy, and hereditary tendency.Among the
apparent exciting causes may be mentioned the habitual over-use of
alcoholic drinks, gluttony, the excessive use of tobacco, suppression
of the menstrual flux, the abuse of purgatives, excessive and prolonged
mercurial medication, and mechanical injuries, either prolonged
pressure or blows upon the epigastrium.As a secondary affection,
disease of the pancreas is associated with chronic diseases of the
heart, lungs, liver, alimentary canal, and abdominal glands, and the
organ may be the seat of metastatic abscesses and tumors.GENERAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The objective symptoms are--rapid and extreme
emaciation of the entire body; sialorrhoea; obstinate diarrhoea with
viscid stools; fatty stools; lipuria; and the presence of masses of
undigested striped muscular fibres in the stools.The well-established fat-absorbing and peptonizing properties of the
pancreatic juice furnish a ready explanation of the wasting of the body
which occurs when this secretion is arrested, diminished in quantity,
or altered in quality by disease.Emaciation is not a constant symptom
of pancreatic disease.A number of cases are mentioned by Abercrombie,
Claessen, and Schiff in which, notwithstanding disease of the gland and
complete closure of the duct, revealed by post-mortem examination, the
patients during life were not only well nourished, but even moderately
corpulent.In such instances it is probable that the digestive
functions of the absent pancreatic juice are more or less adequately
performed by the bile and succus entericus.When present, emaciation is
an early symptom; it is at the same time progressive, and is usually
very intense in degree, being most marked in those cases where there is
associated hepatic disease or obstruction to the passage of bile into
the intestine, where the disease of the pancreas interferes
mechanically with the processes of nutrition by pressing upon the
pyloric extremity of the stomach or upon the duodenum, and when the
organ is the seat of carcinomatous growths.In the last-named
condition, in addition to the perversion or arrest of the secretion,
the loss of flesh is attributable to the general causes of malnutrition
attendant upon carcinoma wherever situated.Sialorrhoea, or an excessive secretion from the salivary glands, is
noticeable as a symptom of disease of the pancreas only when there is
an associated lesion of the stomach, either of a catarrhal or cancerous
nature.Under these circumstances a quantity--six or eight
fluidounces--of a colorless, slightly opalescent, and adhesive and
alkaline fluid may be expelled from the mouth at once as an early
morning pyrosis; or by frequent and repeated acts of expectoration,
following a sudden filling of the mouth with fluid, a large bulk of
thin saliva may be expelled {1115} during the day.This hypersecretion
must not be looked upon as any indication of an especial sympathy
existing between the salivary glands and the pancreas, neither can it
be regarded as a pancreatic flux with a regurgitation of the fluid from
the duodenum into the stomach and thence through the oesophagus into
the mouth, since during the nausea that must always attend the passage
of the intestinal contents into the stomach the pancreatic secretion is
arrested, and since the liquid contains salivary, and not pancreatic,
elements.The diarrhoea pancreatica is the least constant of all the objective
symptoms; in fact, constipation is present in many pancreatic
affections, notably carcinoma.The fecal evacuations in this condition
are frequent, thin, viscid, and contain an abundance of leucin.Under
the microscope the leucin appears either in the form of concentrically
sheathed globules, or as small crystalline rods and scales collected
together in the form of wheels or aggregated in clusters.This form of
diarrhoea may be attributed to a hypersecretion from the pancreas.That the presence of fat in the stools is an important diagnostic
symptom of pancreatic disease is proved both by clinical and
experimental observations.The characters of these stools vary
considerably.The fat may appear mixed with the feces in small lumps,
ranging in size from a pea to a hazelnut, yellowish-white in color,
soluble in aether, and easily melted and burned.Again, after the
evacuation has become cool fat may be seen covering the fecal masses,
collected into a thick cake around the edges of the containing vessel,
or, when the feces are liquid, floating as free oil on the surface.Finally, the fat may be in a crystalline form, the crystals being
needle-shaped and aggregated into sheaves and tufts.It may be present only in small quantities, or may
even be entirely absent from the evacuations in those cases in which
the secretion from the pancreas is simply diminished, and the amount is
greatest in those instances where there is a simultaneous arrest of the
pancreatic and hepatic secretions.It must be remembered, too, that
even in health the stools may contain fat; this occurs when an excess
of oleaginous food is consumed and after the administration of castor
oil or cod-liver oil.These conditions must be eliminated, therefore,
in estimating the value of fatty stools as a diagnostic symptom; if,
then, at the same time, coincident disease of the liver can be
excluded, the symptom becomes almost pathognomonic.The appearance of
fat in the stools may be due not only to an arrest of the pancreatic
secretion, but also to pressure upon the large lymphatic trunks,
interfering with the circulation of the chyle and checking the
absorption of fat from the intestine.Usually, the amount of fat expelled is in direct proportion to the
quantity consumed, but occasionally the former greatly exceeds the
latter.In such cases there must be some other source for the evacuated
fat than the food; and it is probable that fat from the adipose tissue
passes into the blood, and thence through the mesenteric vessels into
the intestine.This theory would likewise account in part for the rapid
and extreme wasting, and for another less frequently observed
symptom--namely, lipuria.A case is recorded by Clark of medullary
cancer of the pancreas with nutmeg liver, and another by Bowditch of
cancer of the pancreas and liver in which lipuria was noted.The fat
was observed, after the urine had cooled, floating about on the surface
in masses or globules; differing, {1116} therefore, from chyluria, for
in this condition the fat is present in the form of an emulsion, and
gives the urine either a uniform milk-like appearance, or, after it has
been allowed to stand, rests upon the surface in a creamy layer.When the pancreatic secretion is arrested, most of the animal food
which has escaped gastric digestion will pass unchanged through the
intestine and give rise to another characteristic condition of the
evacuations--namely, the presence in the feces of undigested striped
muscular fibres.The amount of these fibres, and indeed their
appearance at all in any given case, will depend directly upon the
nature of the food consumed.SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS.--The subjective symptoms of disease of the
pancreas are abnormal sensations in the epigastrium, and pain.The abnormal sensations in the epigastrium are weight and pressure,
attended at times by praecordial oppression and discomfort.The feeling
of weight is usually deep-seated, may be intermittent or constant, and
is generally increased or developed by pressure.It is often influenced
by position, the assumption of the erect posture or turning from side
to side giving rise to a stretching or dragging sensation, as if a
heavy body were falling downward or moving about in the upper abdomen.The pain may be due either to an inflammation of the peritoneum
covering the gland or to pressure upon the solar plexus, and
consequently varies in character.When it depends upon localized
peritonitis, it is constant, circumscribed, and deeply seated in the
epigastrium at a point midway between the tip of the ensiform cartilage
and the umbilicus; it is rather acute, and is greatly augmented by
pressure.The second variety occurs in paroxysms, and is neuralgic in
character, the sharp, excessively severe lancinating pains extending
from the epigastrium through to the back, upward into the thorax, and
downward into the abdomen.These paroxysms--in reality attacks of
coeliac neuralgia--are attended by great anxiety, restlessness, and
oppression and a tendency to syncope.That calculi in the duct of
Wirsung, tightly grasped at the position of arrest, may give rise to
paroxysms of pain analogous to biliary colic, cannot be doubted, though
there are no positive facts in support of this view.PRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--When the pancreas becomes enlarged it encroaches
upon the neighboring blood-vessels and viscera, interferes with their
functions, and thus produces prominent symptoms.The ductus choledochus from its close relation to the head of the gland
is especially liable to become obstructed, with the consequent
production of chronic jaundice and the general effects of the absence
of bile from the intestinal canal.Pressure upon the portal vein gives
rise to enlargement of the spleen; on the inferior cava, to oedema of
the feet and legs; and on the aorta, occasionally, to aneurismal
dilatation of the vessel above the point of obstruction and to
subsequent alteration in the size of the heart.By encroaching on the
stomach an enlarged pancreas may cause either displacement of the
viscus or stenosis at its pyloric extremity, attended with occasional
vomiting of large quantities of grumous, fermenting liquid, pain,
constipation, general failure of health, and the distinctive physical
signs of dilatation of the stomach.The duodenum may also be pressed
upon and more or less occluded, and pain and vomiting occur several
hours after food is taken.Occasionally hydronephrosis is {1117}
produced, the accumulation being usually in the right kidney and due to
obstruction of the corresponding ureter.A sufficient number of cases have been collected to show that there is
an intimate connection between disease of the pancreas and diabetes
mellitus.One or other condition may take the precedence, melituria
occurring during the progress of pancreatic disease, demonstrating the
onset of diabetes, and the appearance of fatty stools in diabetes a
secondary involvement of the pancreas.Various theories have been
advanced to account for this association, but the true explanation
seems to be based upon the experiments of Munk and Klebs.By
experimenting upon dogs these observers found that extirpation of the
solar plexus produced either permanent or temporary diabetes, whereas
section of the hepatic and splanchnic nerves, removal of the pancreas,
or ligature of the duct of Wirsung was without effect.From the
intimate anatomical relation of the pancreas to the solar plexus it is
easy to understand how disease of the gland may give rise to
alterations in the nerve-structure, either by direct pressure or by the
extension of inflammation along the nerve-fibres connecting the gland
with the ganglia; and these alterations in time produce diabetes.In
the instances in which diabetes is the primary affection the condition
of the pancreas, as proved by post-mortem section, is usually one of
simple or fatty atrophy; and it may be assumed that a lesion of the
solar plexus is the cause of both diseases, the changes in the pancreas
being produced in a similar way to the atrophy of the submaxillary
gland after section of the vaso-motor nerves in Bernard's experiments.The same nerve-lesion may give rise to bronzing of the skin, and two
cases are recorded in which disease of the pancreas (cheesy
infiltration, cancer) was attended by this symptom.PHYSICAL SIGNS.--To make a successful exploration of the pancreas the
stomach and colon should be as far as possible empty, and the patient
placed in a position, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated and
the thighs drawn up toward the belly, to relax the abdominal muscles;
or if necessary this relaxation must be brought about by the
administration of aether.The knee-elbow position is often preferable
to the dorsal position in practising palpation.The condition of the gland giving rise to physical signs is one of
enlargement, affecting chiefly and primarily its head, and due
generally to the presence of some morbid growth.Inspection reveals either a diffuse bulging of the upper third of the
abdomen to the right of the median line, or a well-defined tumor
situated beneath the right costal border, about the line of junction of
the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions.Often the pancreatic
tumor does not come in direct contact with the abdominal wall, but
presses against and thrusts forward the left lobe of the liver,
producing simply a prominence in the epigastrium.In the first
condition palpation elicits an ill-defined sense of resistance; in the
second, the fingers readily outline a tumor, which is slightly movable,
rounded in shape, firm or fluctuating, with a smooth or nodulated
surface, usually tender to the touch, and often giving a false impulse
transmitted from the aorta lying beneath; and in the third, the smooth
surface and the sharp edge of the left lobe of the liver are easily
distinguishable.{1118} Percussion over a pancreatic tumor is commonly dully-tympanitic,
absolute flatness occurring only when it is very large and comes
directly in contact with the abdominal wall, pushing aside the stomach
and intestines.On auscultation a blowing murmur may, in some instances, be heard over
the tumor.These murmurs are due to pressure upon the aorta, and must
be distinguished from the sound produced in aneurism of this vessel.The various complications of pancreatic disease, such as dilatation of
the stomach, ascites, and secondary lesions of the liver, greatly
modify the physical signs, and sometimes entirely prevent an
exploration of the gland.INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis.It occurs most frequently in males during and
after adult life, and the strumous diathesis appears to predispose to
it.Intemperance, the suppression of normal or morbid discharges, and
traumatism act as exciting causes.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The pathological changes may be divided into
two stages.In the first the gland is deep red in color, intensely
injected with blood, greatly increased in consistence, enlarged to the
extent of two or three times its normal size, and when an incision is
made the divided lobules feel firm and crisp.The interlobular tissue
is sometimes dotted with bloody points, and the same hemorrhagic
changes may occur in the connective tissue surrounding the gland.In
this stage resolution may occur or the inflammation may pass into
suppuration.At the beginning of the second, or suppurative, stage
numerous minute collections of pus are seen scattered throughout the
gland in the interacinous tissue; these gradually collect into a single
large abscess, and at times the whole gland is converted into a mere
pus-sac, the capsule being much thickened.In other instances the
formation of pus is entirely peripancreatic.The pus is usually
inodorous and creamy, but is sometimes grayish-white or greenish in
color; it then has a faint disagreeable odor, and occasionally is very
fetid.When mixed with pancreatic juice it becomes clear and yellowish
in color, and contains numerous minute curd-like masses.In the first stage secondary peritonitis may arise from a simple
extension of the inflammatory process, and bands of lymph are formed,
gluing the pancreas to the neighboring organs.In the second, fatal
acute peritonitis may result from the bursting of an abscess into the
peritoneal cavity.These abscesses also occasionally open into the
duodenum or stomach.Gangrene and peripancreatic sloughing occur very
exceptionally, and are probably due to extensive hemorrhagic changes.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The disease may be preceded for an indefinite
period by symptoms of impaired gastric or intestinal digestion, but its
onset is usually sudden.The attack begins with colic or continuous
{1119} deep-seated pain, starting in the epigastrium and extending
toward the right shoulder or the back, and quickly becoming very
intense.The pain is attended by pallor of the face, great
restlessness, praecordial anxiety, dyspnoea, and faintness.The tongue
is furred or dry and red; thirst is increased; the appetite is lost;
there are frequent eructations, nausea, and constant vomiting of a
clear, greenish, viscid fluid; the vomiting produces no sense of
relief, and even increases the epigastric pain.The bowels are
obstinately constipated.The epigastric region is tense, tumid, and
excessively tender, so that it is usually impossible to elicit the
physical signs of enlargement of the gland.There is moderate pyrexia,
with evening exacerbations, and the pulse is increased in frequency.These symptoms progressively increase in severity, and reach their
maximum intensity in from three to five days.The pulse then becomes
small, compressible, and irregular, the extremities cold, the face
hippocratic, and death takes place in a state of collapse.The fatal
termination is preceded by the symptoms of acute peritonitis in the
cases which are complicated by an extension of inflammation or the
rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity.Recovery is quite possible in the early stage of the disease.On the
other hand, the course may be greatly protracted by a change in the
type of the inflammation, resulting in induration and enlargement of
the gland or in the formation of chronic abscesses.Again, when
peritonitis from extension has been confined solely to the portion of
the peritoneum that covers the gland, and has resulted in the formation
of fibrinous bands binding the pancreas to the adjacent viscera, the
symptoms of pancreatitis will on subsiding give place to those of
obstruction of the stomach, duodenum, or bile-duct.DIAGNOSIS.--The diseases most likely to be confounded with acute
pancreatitis are biliary colic and the catarrhal form of acute
gastritis.From biliary colic it is distinguished by the absence of rigors,
jaundice, enlargement of the liver, and a tender pyriform tumor
corresponding in situation to the gall-bladder and due to its
distension with accumulated bile.The pain in both affections is sudden
in its onset, and very similar in character and distribution; but when
caused by the passage of a gall-stone it usually begins either after a
heavy meal or after some severe muscular exertion or shaking of the
body--circumstances inoperative in the production of the pain of
pancreatitis.The pain, too, in the former condition is less severe at
first, increases gradually in severity, is more paroxysmal, is at the
outset lessened by pressure, and is often temporarily relieved by the
act of vomiting.The attacks at the same time are rarely isolated, and
all doubt is removed when the pain ceases suddenly and a calculus is
discovered in the feces.Acute gastric catarrh is almost always traceable to the ingestion of
some irritant substance, usually alcohol or food of bad quality.This
history, together with the liability of the attack to occur during the
course of chronic dyspepsia, the comparatively trifling severity of the
pain, the headache, the irregularity of the bowels, the condition of
the urine, which is either high- or deposits lithates
abundantly, and the tendency of the affection to become chronic, are
the points of distinction between this and the pancreatic disease.{1120} Acute inflammation of the stomach, or gastritis proper,
resulting from corrosive poisons, presents a train of symptoms entirely
different from those of acute pancreatitis.TREATMENT.--Absolute rest is essential.The diet should consist of milk
guarded by lime-water and of meat-broths, this food being administered
in small quantities--one to two or three fluidounces of the milk and
lime-water or half as much broth--at proper intervals.In the early
stage an effort must be made to reduce the inflammation by the
application of ice to the epigastrium or of leeches to the same region,
or preferably to the anus.The excessive pain demands the free use of
opium.The nausea and vomiting may be relieved to some extent by
directing the patient to swallow small lumps of ice, and by the
employment of iced carbonic-acid water and the effervescing draught;
and the tendency to constipation may be overcome by enemata.Later in
the course of the disease, if the epigastric tenderness permits of it,
light linseed poultices should be placed over the upper abdomen.During
the stage of collapse alcoholic stimulants and the application of heat
to the extremities are necessary.The occurrence of acute peritonitis
or other complications and sequelae demand appropriate treatment.In this condition the pancreas may be the seat of either acute
parenchymatous inflammation or of metastatic abscesses.Acute parenchymatous degeneration of the muscles, kidneys, liver, and
so on is recognized as a frequent lesion in the acute infectious
diseases, particularly typhoid fever; and it is under these
circumstances, and in association always with similar changes in some
of the organs mentioned, that parenchymatous degeneration of the
pancreas takes place.Metastatic suppurative inflammation is very rare: it has been observed
in cases of disease of the testicles after the operation of extirpation
of these organs, and occasionally in puerperal peritonitis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--In parenchymatous inflammation the gland at
first is hardened, swollen, and reddened, and on section presents a
reddish-gray surface, with indistinctness of the glandular structure,
due to the amount of swelling of the acini.Under the microscope the
gland-cells are found to be enlarged; they contain several nuclei,
their protoplasm is infiltrated with fatty granules, obscuring the
nuclei to a certain extent, and their outline is well defined.These
alterations are most marked in the head of the gland.After a time the
hypertrophy of the cells, by pressing upon the blood-vessels, produces
an anaemic condition and the organ becomes pale; in the advanced stages
softening occurs.Metastatic suppurative inflammation leads to the formation of a single
large abscess or to multiple minute purulent collections.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Parenchymatous degeneration gives rise to no
distinctive symptoms.Its occurrence in typhoid fever or other
infectious disease may be suspected when after prolonged hyperpyrexia
there are enlargement of the liver and spleen and albuminuria.The
appearance of jaundice (from pressure) increases the probability of
involvement of the pancreas in the general gland-change.{1121} The development of rigors, alternating with flushing, during the
course of one of the lesions liable to be attended with metastatic
abscesses in the pancreas might suggest the formation of pus in the
gland, but an absolute diagnosis is impossible.Several cases are on record pointing to the possibility of a metastasis
of mumps from the parotid gland to the pancreas.In these the
disappearance of the parotiditis was followed by symptoms resembling
those of idiopathic pancreatitis--namely, thirst, fever, loss of
appetite, anxiety, and burning in the epigastrium, with deep-seated
pain extending toward the right side; in addition there was diarrhoea,
with numerous, yellowish, watery stools.In one case that resulted
fatally the secondary diarrhoea suddenly ceased and the parotid
swelling reappeared.At the autopsy the pancreas was found to be
swollen, reddened, engorged with blood, and indurated.Such a
metastasis, however, must be very infrequent, and more extended
observations are necessary to establish its course and clinical
features.The first form of acute secondary pancreatitis may be a comparatively
unimportant complication of the acute infectious diseases, or, together
with the parenchymatous degeneration of other organs, may form a
distinct element in the fatal issue of these diseases.Metastatic abscesses are prone to be followed by ulceration and the
formation of fistulous communications with the neighboring viscera.TREATMENT.--The management of secondary inflammation of the pancreas is
regulated solely by the indications derived from the originating
disease.Inflammation of the connective tissue of the gland usually occurs after
adult life, and depends upon a variety of causes.The secondary form, due to long-continued venous engorgement resulting
from lesions of the cardiac valves and from chronic disease of the
lungs or liver, is the most frequently observed.Other causes are closure of the duct of Wirsung, the retained secretion
producing pressure upon the glandular tissue; the extension of
inflammation from adjacent organs, as the bile-duct when there is an
impacted gall-stone, or the stomach and duodenum, especially in cancer
and perforating ulcer, where the floor of the ulcer is formed by the
pancreas; the pressure of tumors, as aneurisms of the abdominal aorta
and coeliac axis; chronic alcoholism; and syphilis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The lesion may be limited to the head or to
isolated portions of the gland, or be uniformly distributed.The
general changes are a hyperplasia of the interacinous connective
tissue, with subsequent contraction and atrophy, or, in extreme
instances, entire destruction of the glandular elements proper, the
organ becoming granular and firmer and tougher than normal.A section
shows a pale surface, studded at intervals with white spots, from which
little cheese-like and fatty masses may be squeezed, and, when there
has been intense hyperaemia, with minute collections of reddish pigment
and small hemorrhagic cysts, indicating previous interstitial
hemorrhages.{1122} When the contraction causes closure of the small excretory ducts
or of the duct of Wirsung itself, the section shows secondary cysts and
beaded canals.In exceptional instances of acquired syphilis the pancreas is the seat
of gummata or sclerosis, but in congenital syphilis hyperplasia of the
glandular connective tissue frequently occurs, being usually associated
with specific lesions of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and general
glandular system.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As chronic pancreatitis rarely attains a
sufficient degree of development to interfere seriously with the
function of the organ, the disease is usually latent, or masked by the
symptoms of the originating lesion in secondary hyperplasia, or by the
associated diseases of the abdominal viscera in alcoholism and acquired
syphilis.When due to hereditary syphilis, the foetus is stillborn or death takes
place soon after birth, and there are no characteristic symptoms.Occasionally, however, especially when it depends upon a complete
obstruction of the duct of Wirsung, a diagnosis may be made from the
presence of emaciation, fatty stools, and melituria, with epigastric
pain of a neuralgic character, and the discovery of a deep-seated,
dense tumor extending transversely across the epigastrium.The duration is indefinite, and varies greatly with the cause.While a
return to the healthy condition is possible during the early stage of
the lesion, the usual course is similar to that of chronic interstitial
inflammation in other organs.TREATMENT.--The management, when a diagnosis can be made, must be
guided mainly by the etiological indications.The restoration of the
functions of the heart, lungs, or liver when these organs are at fault,
the abstinence from alcohol in the drunkard, and an energetic use of
mercurials or iodide of potassium in syphilis, are of the first
importance in arresting the disease.A persistent course of mild
purgatives and of cathartic mineral waters is serviceable.Pain should
be relieved by belladonna or opium.The diet must be simple and
digestible, and if an arrest of the pancreatic secretion be indicated
by the appearance of fat in the stools, an effort should be made to
supply the deficiency.For this purpose pancreatin, prepared by
precipitation by alcohol from a watery extract of a calf's or pig's
pancreas, may be used.[1] The pancreatin may be given in doses of from
five to fifteen grains, in the form of a pill or in capsules, and at an
interval of two hours after food is taken, or the same quantity of
pancreatin may be added to the food a few moments before it is eaten.Probably the best substitute is a watery infusion of the gland
containing all its soluble principles.To prepare an active infusion
the pancreas must be taken from the animal during the act of digestion.It is then freed from its surrounding fat, and macerated for two hours
in four times its weight of water at a temperature ranging between 25
degrees and 30 degrees C.(58.3 degrees and 61.1 degrees F.).Another
plan is to beat a calf's pancreas in a mortar with six fluidounces of
water until a milk-like fluid is obtained, and strain.One-third of the
infusion obtained by either method is administered after each meal, an
entire pancreas being thus used every twenty-four hours.[Footnote 1: One gramme of pancreatin is sufficient to emulsify fifteen
grammes of fatty substances, to convert eight grammes of starch into
glucose, to digest fifty grammes of fibrin, twenty grammes of
syntonine, and thirty-three grammes of boiled albumen (Raymond).]{1123} The extractum pancreatis,[2] as it is now furnished to the
profession, is a very useful preparation.It may be employed to
peptonize milk, milk-gruel, and broth, or be given in combination with
bicarbonate of sodium at a fixed interval after each meal, as in the
following formula:

  Rx.pancreatis,    drachm j;
      Sodii bicarbonatis, drachm ij;
  M. et.S. One powder to be taken two hours after each meal.[Footnote 2: That prepared by Fairchild Brothers & Foster of New York
has proved the best in my hands.]Peptonized milk is prepared by putting into a clean quart bottle 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
a gill of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place
the bottle in water not so hot but that the whole hand can be held in
it without discomfort for a minute, and keep the bottle there for
exactly thirty minutes.At the end of that time put the bottle on ice
to check further digestion and keep the milk from spoiling.Peptonized milk-gruel is made of equal parts of any farinaceous gruel
and fresh cold milk.To a pint of this combination 5 grains of
extractum pancreatis and 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium are added,
and the whole allowed to stand in a warm place for thirty minutes, when
the process of digestion must be arrested by placing on ice.Peptonized broth is made in the following way: Take one-fourth of a
pound of finely-minced raw lean beef or mutton or chicken, and one-half
pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire, stirring constantly, until
it has boiled a few minutes.Then pour off the liquor, beat the meat to
a paste, and put both into a bottle with a half pint of cold water.Add
30 grains of extractum pancreatis and 20 grains of bicarbonate of
sodium; shake well, and set in a warm place (110-115 degrees) for three
hours, shaking occasionally; then boil quickly.Finally, strain or
clarify in the usual way and season to taste.MORBID GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS.Cancer is probably the most common of the chronic affections of the
pancreas.It is usually secondary, being due to an extension of
carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum, liver, or abdominal lymphatic
glands, but there are enough cases on record to show that it may be
primary.It has been discovered in the foetus at birth, but the vast
majority of cases occur after the age of forty.Nothing is known as to the influence of inherited
tendency in the production of the disease, and as little of the
exciting causes, though some authors attach much importance to
prolonged pressure upon the epigastrium and to blows and contusions on
the upper part of the abdomen.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--Primary carcinoma may be either {1124}
scirrhous, encephaloid, or colloid, the first being the variety most
frequently observed.The lesion begins in the head of the gland in the form of several small
nodules which gradually coalesce.Sometimes the whole gland becomes
involved in the new formation; again, isolated nodules may be scattered
throughout its substance, and exceptionally the growth is limited to
the tail or middle portion.When the head alone is involved, the
remainder of the gland either remains healthy, undergoes fatty
degeneration, or becomes indurated.The tumor is rounded in outline and
nodular, and varies in size, density, and color according to the form
of carcinoma present.The duct of Wir
